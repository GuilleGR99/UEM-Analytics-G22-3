In this study, we propose a representation method of multi-modal optical networks using high-dimensional matrix diagram. Our study designs an advantage actor critic (A2C) learning framework named deep reinforcement learning based routing and wavelength allocation (DRL-RWA). DRL-RWA learns the correct online routing and wavelength allocation policy by parameterizing the convolutional neural network (CNN) that can sense the state of complex optical networks. We further improve DRL-RWA and propose DRL-RWA with the multi-thread-based training mechanism (DRL-RWA-MT) algorithm using novel A2C and CNNâ\x80\x99s training mechanism. DRL-RWA-MT converts dynamic network resources and request routing to graphs by using the representation method of the high-dimensional matrix diagram. These graphs are input to the CNN for parsing the information in the graphs, and CNN's output is transmitted to A2C for learning the correct online RWA policy. The optimization goal of DRL-RWA-MT in each step of the request is to maximize the cumulative reward in the remaining training. Results with multiple topologies show that the multi-modal representation method can improve the learning efficiency, and the proposed ACRA algorithm can optimize the resource allocation. Compared to the baseline (Dijkstra shortest path and First Fit (DSP-FF)), DRL-RWA-MT can optimize resource allocation while effectively reducing blocking probability in the 9-node and NSFNET topologies.
