In this work, we study a novel and efficient full-duplex strategy network ( FSNet ) to address this issue, by considering a better mutual restraint scheme linking motion and appearance allowing exploitation of cross-modal features from the fusion and decoding stage. Specifically, we introduce a relational cross-attention module (RCAM) to achieve bidirectional message propagation across embedding sub-spaces. To improve the model’s robustness and update inconsistent features from the spatiotemporal embeddings, we adopt a bidirectional purification module after the RCAM. Extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks show that our FSNet is robust to various challenging scenarios (e.g., motion blur and occlusion), and compares well to leading methods both for video object segmentation and video salient object detection. The project is publicly available at https://github.com/GewelsJI/FSNet .","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

In this paper, we present an efficient end-to-end deep learning model for automatically detecting and removing specular highlights in a single image. In particular, an encoder—decoder network is utilized to detect specular highlights, and then a novel Unet-Transformer network performs highlight removal; we append transformer modules instead of feature maps in the Unet architecture. We also introduce a highlight detection module as a mask to guide the removal task. Thus, these two networks can be jointly trained in an effective manner. Thanks to the hierarchical and global properties of the transformer mechanism, our framework is able to establish relationships between continuous self-attention layers, making it possible to directly model the mapping between the diffuse area and the specular highlight area, and reduce indeterminacy within areas containing strong specular highlight reflection. Experiments on public benchmark and real-world images demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both highlight detection and removal tasks.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"
doi:10.1007/s41095-021-0267-z,en,Facial optical flow estimation via neural non-rigid registration,"['OriginalPaper', 'Research Article']","Optical flow estimation in human facial video, which provides 2D correspondences between adjacent frames, is a fundamental pre-processing step for many applications, like facial expression capture and recognition. However, it is quite challenging as human facial images contain large areas of similar textures, rich expressions, and large rotations. These characteristics also result in the scarcity of large, annotated real-world datasets. We propose a robust and accurate method to learn facial optical flow in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, we utilize various shape priors, including face depth, landmarks, and parsing, to guide the self-supervised learning task via a differentiable nonrigid registration framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable improvements for facial optical flow estimation in the presence of significant expressions and large rotations.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"
doi:10.1007/s41095-022-0272-x,en,Imposing temporal consistency on deep monocular body shape and pose estimation,"['OriginalPaper', 'Research Article']","Accurate and temporally consistent modeling of human bodies is essential for a wide range of applications, including character animation, understanding human social behavior, and AR/VR interfaces. Capturing human motion accurately from a monocular image sequence remains challenging; modeling quality is strongly influenced by temporal consistency of the captured body motion. Our work presents an elegant solution to integrating temporal constraints during fitting. This increases both temporal consistency and robustness during optimization. In detail, we derive parameters of a sequence of body models, representing shape and motion of a person. We optimize these parameters over the complete image sequence, fitting a single consistent body shape while imposing temporal consistency on the body motion, assuming body joint trajectories to be linear over short time. Our approach enables the derivation of realistic 3D body models from image sequences, including jaw pose, facial expression, and articulated hands. Our experiments show that our approach accurately estimates body shape and motion, even for challenging movements and poses. Further, we apply it to the particular application of sign language analysis, where accurate and temporally consistent motion modelling is essential, and show that the approach is well-suited to this kind of application.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"
doi:10.1007/s41095-022-0276-6,en,Point cloud completion via structured feature maps using a feedback network,"['OriginalPaper', 'Research Article']","In this paper, we tackle the challenging problem of point cloud completion from the perspective of feature learning. Our key observation is that to recover the underlying structures as well as surface details, given partial input, a fundamental component is a good feature representation that can capture both global structure and local geometric details. We accordingly first propose FSNet, a feature structuring module that can adaptively aggregate point-wise features into a 2D structured feature map by learning multiple latent patterns from local regions. We then integrate FSNet into a coarse-to-fine pipeline for point cloud completion. Specifically, a 2D convolutional neural network is adopted to decode feature maps from FSNet into a coarse and complete point cloud. Next, a point cloud upsampling network is used to generate a dense point cloud from the partial input and the coarse intermediate output. To efficiently exploit local structures and enhance point distribution uniformity, we propose IFNet, a point upsampling module with a self-correction mechanism that can progressively refine details of the generated dense point cloud. We have conducted qualitative and quantitative experiments on ShapeNet, MVP, and KITTI datasets, which demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art point cloud completion approaches.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

As a popular application, composition recommendation for a photo focusing on a specific subject has been ignored by recent deep-learning-based composition recommendation approaches. In this paper, we propose a subject-aware image composition recommendation method, SAC-Net, which takes an RGB image and a binary subject window mask as input, and returns good compositions as crops containing the subject. Our model first determines candidate scores for all possible coarse cropping windows. The crops with high candidate scores are selected and further refined by regressing their corner points to generate the output recommended cropping windows. The final scores of the refined crops are predicted by a final score regression module. Unlike existing methods that need to preset several cropping windows, our network is able to automatically regress cropping windows with arbitrary aspect ratios and sizes. We propose novel stability losses for maximizing smoothness when changing cropping windows along with view changes. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods not only on the subject-aware image composition recommendation task, but also for general purpose composition recommendation. We also have designed a multistage labeling scheme so that a large amount of ranked pairs can be produced economically. We use this scheme to propose the first subject-aware composition dataset SACD, which contains 2777 images, and more than 5 million composition ranked pairs. The SACD dataset is publicly available at https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/SACD/ .","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

While voxel-based deep learning frameworks have been proposed for this segmentation task, their performance remains limited. In this study, we offer a two-step surface-based deep learning pipeline that achieves significantly better results. Our proposed model takes a surface model of an entire set of principal brain arteries containing aneurysms as input and returns aneurysm surfaces as output. A user first generates a surface model by manually specifying multiple thresholds for time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography images. The system then samples small surface fragments from the entire set of brain arteries and classifies the surface fragments according to whether aneurysms are present using a point-based deep learning network (PointNet++). Finally, the system applies surface segmentation (SO-Net) to surface fragments containing aneurysms. We conduct a direct comparison of the segmentation performance of our proposed surface-based framework and an existing voxel-based method by counting voxels: our framework achieves a much higher Dice similarity (72%) than the prior approach (46%).","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

Most target search studies, especially in robotics, focus on determining either the shortest path when the target’s position is known, or a strategy to find the target as quickly as possible when the target’s position is unknown. However, the target’s position is often known intermittently in the real world, e.g., in the case of using surveillance cameras. Our goal is to help user find a dynamic target efficiently in the real world when the target’s position is intermittently known. In order to achieve this purpose, we have designed an AR guidance assistance system to provide optimal current directional guidance to users, based on searching a prediction graph. We assume that a certain number of depth cameras are fixed in a real scene to obtain dynamic target’s position. The system automatically analyzes all possible meetings between the user and the target, and generates optimal directional guidance to help the user catch up with the target. A user study was used to evaluate our method, and its results showed that compared to free search and a top-view method, our method significantly improves target search efficiency.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

In contrast to significant recent advances in automating the FRP manufacturing process via 3D printing, quality inspection and defect detection remain largely manual and inefficient. In this paper, we propose a new approach to automatically detect, from microscope images, one of the major defects in 3D printed FRP parts: fiber-deficient areas (or equivalently, resin-rich areas). From cross-sectional microscope images, we detect the locations and sizes of fibers, construct their Voronoi diagram, and employ α -shape theory to determine fiber-deficient areas. Our Voronoi diagram and α -shape construction algorithms are specialized to exploit typical characteristics of 3D printed FRP parts, giving significant efficiency gains. Our algorithms robustly handle real-world inputs containing hundreds of thousands of fiber cross-sections, whether in general or non-general position.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

The first is to increase the intrinsic motivation of students to learn, by making the whole process more fun, enjoyable and competitive. The second is to facilitate the learning process by providing intuitive tools for the visualization of data structures and algorithmic output, together with a tool for automated assessment that decreases the dependence on the teacher and allows them to work more autonomously.

It is reconfigurable because GRACE is malleable and can take different forms (reaching out to people who are committed to the agenda as well as to people who are within the domain but not necessarily committed to the agenda) – even though its core remains the same. GRACE is relational because the nature of the installation emerges in use and thus is shaped by the relational connections created through specific use and people enacting the artefact.

The land surface temperature (LST) data and its co-related parameter of the study area, i.e. Srinagar City, JK, India, has been extracted from satellite imageries. LST data of the study area is assessed to understand the evolution to help analyse the UHI effect and its variance.

In having a voluminous dataset, i.e. 16 sampled LST data/each km 2 /year measured in Kelvin(k), various machine learning algorithms were applied on LST data to establish relations for UHI modelling. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms were used on continuous LST data to define clusters and further standardized/compared with existing scientific classifications of the study area. The number of clusters was tweaked to determine the best-case scenario. Additionally, correlation and regression were applied to determine if there is multicollinearity amongst the LST data.

It modifies data to protect an individual's sensitive information by disconnecting the link between an individual and its sensitive information. k-anonymization uses generalization and suppression tools to anonymize the data. Generalization replaces specific values of attributes with general values, and suppression deletes unmatched values of attributes. There are many existing single table anonymization algorithms. The proposed work presents how a single table anonymization algorithm can be applied on multi-relation dataset. It also discusses the problems encountered when single table anonymization algorithms are used for the multi-relation dataset. Present work also discusses the limitations of k-anonymization and gives future research directions.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Statistics, general', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The tumor can be cancerous or non-cancerous. The cancerous brain tumor can spread to the breast, colon, lung, and kidney. Therefore, precise and appropriate detection of brain tumors is important to prevent loss of life. It is crucial to predict the size and location of the brain tumor. Many people lose their lives due to the time taken to diagnose the tumor’s presence in the brain due to such a complex structure of the brain. Thus, a model is required to detect the brain tumor in the reduced timeline. Due to the advancement in technology and image processing, Machine learning is capable to find probabilistic parameters. These parameters help to predict the insight of the image. In the research work, digital Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is used for image enhancement, and improved Otsu’s method is applied for the thresholding. Thresholding is applied to categorize the images in background and foreground.

Verifying these systems is a major challenge that is still an active topic of research in different domains. In this paper, we focus on verifying these systems that we model using trust protocols under uncertainty. Specifically, we address the problem using an effective verification approach called three-valued model checking. We introduce a new logic by extending the recently proposed Computation Tree Logic of Trust (TCTL) to the three-valued case ( $$3v-TCTL$$ 3 v - T C T L ) to reason about trust with uncertainty over smart contract-based systems. We also propose a new transformation approach to reduce the $$3v-TCTL$$ 3 v - T C T L model checking problem to the classical case. We apply our approach to a smart contract-based drug traceability system in the healthcare supply chain. The approach is implemented using a Java toolkit that automatically interacts with the NuSMV model checker.

One of the primary challenges that instructors face is regarding the introduction of important theory to students, both to show its essential nature to the field as well as its practicality. This paper analyzes two pedagogical methods for the instruction of normal forms in database management systems, a mandatory topic in any database course. The first of these methods is a theory-based approach that relies on written works (i.e., theory) to introduce the concept. The second of these focuses on a practice-based approach (i.e., practice) which aligns with the normal form as students implement a database schema. Through a small study, it was determined that most students have a strong predisposition to theory-first education, though students seemed to prefer the practice-based approach more than the theory-first approach. This paper compares the two methodologies, given this insight, and advises the use of an appropriate method for future educators.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Most strokes are caused by an ischemic stroke which is a result of arterial occlusion. In most cases, strokes are found in people aged 55 and above. They occur more often in men than women although women tend to fall, victim, when they are older, they are more likely to die from it. A doctor will usually use physical examination and family history to diagnose stroke. They could also get an idea of the location of the symptoms. The best way to determine the root cause is through a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan. However, Doctors are humans and can have eye defects which could cause misreading of the diagnosis. Emotions could also affect our judgment as we are all humans. Therefore, this paper proposes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for stroke classification. Chi-square was used for feature selection to remove irrelevant features from the dataset. The dataset used is obtained from the Kaggle website, the dataset contains several risk factors with more than 500 instances. The risk factors contain features that can cause blockage or cut off of blood flow to the brain. An accuracy of 95.91%, a precision of 95.37%, and a sensitivity of 98.10% were attained.

Those services can be combined and modified to serve various purposes, which leads to an increase in requirement variability. The variability needs to be documented to track any changes and optimize the reusability. The issues are related to variability management, which is one of the main concerns in software product line engineering (SPLE). We propose an approach to re-engineer microservice applications into SPLE. The process comprises variability modeling, architectural design, and product line implementation. To model the variability in microservices, we use a multi-level feature diagram. The feature diagram is combined with the UML class diagram from existing systems to design a product line architecture. We utilize the UML-DOP profile that provides an extension to represent delta-oriented concepts in the UML notation. UML diagrams with UML-DOP profile are used to capture several levels of abstractions in the architectural models. These models enable traceability from requirements to endpoints implementation. The proposed approach is shown by performing a re-engineering for existing microservice-based webshop systems. The result is a microservices-based product line that can be generated into various applications.","['Computer Science', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Software Management', 'Computer System Implementation']"

In particular, recent years have seen increased research attention toward serious games based on Immersive Virtual Reality technologies (i.e., large-scale projection-based systems, head-mounted displays). This is due to the benefits that the high level of immersion produces in learning outcomes: a high level of immersion eliminates environmental distractions and fosters attention on the learning tasks as well as coping with anxiety and social phobias. Unfortunately, the design and evaluation of these interventions are not without challenges and issues, given the difficulties in applying adequate and rigorous methodological design approaches. This paper presents a review of the available Serious Games for Autism based on Immersive Virtual Reality, developed between 2009 and mid-2021, selected and categorized with respect to target users’ characteristics, learning purpose, and the adopted Immersive Virtual Reality technologies. The analysis mainly put a lens on technological aspects and on how these interventions were designed, as well as on the people involved in the design itself.

Recent contributions delved into the usage of Gradient-descent (GD) based schemes to optimize differentiable loss functions, built to measure the graph layout adherence to given layout characteristics. However, some properties cannot be easily expressed via differentiable functions. In this direction, the recently proposed Graph Neural Drawer (GND) framework proposes to exploit the representational capability of neural models in order to be able to express differentiable losses, specifically for edge intersection, that can be subsequently optimized via GD. In this paper, we propose to improve graph layout readability leveraging linear splines. We exploit the principles behind GND and use a neural model both to identify crossing edges and to optimize their relative position. We split crossing edges introducing linear splines, and threat the control points as novel “fake” vertices that can be optimized via the underlying layout optimization process. We provide qualitative and quantitative analysis over multiple graphs and optimizing different aesthetic losses, that show how the proposed method is a viable solution.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computers and Education', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.

In majority of location-based systems, data security is ensured via data replacement policies. Data replacement or hiding policy requires additional measures for providing required security standards for Industry 4.0. Whereas, cryptography primitives and protocols are integral part of any network and can be re-used for ensuring user’s locations in Industry 4.0 based applications. In this work, an application has been designed and developed that used RSA encryption/decryption algorithm for ensuring location data’s confidentiality. The proposed system is distributed in nature and gives access to location’s information after users get authenticated and authorized. In the proposed system, a threshold-based subset mechanism is adopted for keys and their storage. Server is designed to securely store the location information for clients and provide this information to those set of clients or users who are able to verify sum of subset of keys. This work has elaborated the location-based data confidentiality designs in a distributed client/server environment and presented the in-depth system working with different flow diagrams. The command line and graphical User Interface (GUI)-based implementation shows that the proposed system is capable of working with standard system requirements (i5 processor, 4 GB RAM and 64-bits operating system).

Data collected across various sources can play an important role in predicting and identifying of COVID-19 virus based on the models and the classifications of this data using the most sophisticated machine learning models. The concern here is accessing or transferring an individual’s data from their personal health devices which defers users’ privacy. In the recent past, there are a lot of research that has been done these days on how blockchain can help to securely track and transfer the data across trusted sources. Adding to this, federated learning also is helping on-device data usage without any critical data to be transferred to various external sources. The proposed study directs the stability of frequent health status with the help of wearable devices that capture health metrics like heart rate, blood oxygen levels, breathing rate, muscle activities, stress, emotions, movement patterns, sleep activity, precipitation, and mind/cognitive functions with the introduction of the data streams and models that can seamlessly transfer the data, with the assurance of data integrity, privacy, and control which is the scope of this paper. The usage of both the emerging technologies provides a value addition in terms of health data exchange with effective data distribution with decentralized privacy and computation.

Offense against women made an appearance in the early stages, and it is continuing. The present research based on an inferential methodology using scan statistics. It is one of the most extensively used statistical methods as one of the most popular emerging data science techniques in the study of events like crime. Moral degradation in human values, narrow-mindedness, growing intolerance, lack of value-based education, illiteracy, and unemployment are some of the critical factors, that is likely to be held responsible for offenders to perpetrate criminal activities that could lead to such a heinous and shameful crime event. The research is conducted based on the secondary data available on the data portal, gathered from different government sources. The geographical unit under the study is based on various crime zones adjusted to and embed into the revenue district of NCT of Delhi. The p-value obtained from the log-likelihood ratio for each crime district taken as the basis of identification and segregation of hotspot. The software used for computation is M.S. Excel, MS Solver, R-Studio, and SaTScan. The current work considered to be of great importance in the optimization of resources needed for crime control, monitoring, and surveillance to avoid such events in any form in future planning. The term optimization is used for maximal utilization of available scarce resources like installation of cameras, number of police deployments, distribution of various sophisticated policing equipment’s etc. to an extent of best possible measures to curb the menace effectively. Presently policing resources per person in NCT of Delhi is very much scarce and Delhi can be rated as very poor on that scale. For example, even in 2021 the estimated number of sanctioned strengths of Delhi Police is 83,762, means there are only 27 police sanctioned (not deployed) per ten thousand of the population. The actual number of deployed police per ten thousand populations may be further less. Similarly, we can cite an example of available CCTV cameras for surveillance estimated in the year 2021 is 1.32 lakh which comes to almost four CCTV for ten thousand person and even many of them are nonfunctional and defectives due to poor operational and maintenance reasons. Hence the problem of optimum utilization of resources is of prime importance. As such the relevance of the present work is aiming at societal interest and also enables our stressed policing bodies to execute an effective planning, is likely to be appreciated.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Management']"

It is very time-consuming and less efficient to find analogous web pages without applying the clustering. Clustering of web pages arranges a large number of web documents into relevant small clustered groups. In this paper, a novel similitude degree computation technique is proposed to provide the web documents related to the context in which multiple related web documents are the members of the same cluster. The clustering module results in web documents’ arrangement with their associated topic and corresponding computed similitude or similarity score. This provides the user clusters containing equivalent web documents related to the issue of desire. This context-based grouping of web documents reduces the time taken for searching relevant data and improves the results in response to a user request. Moreover, the comparison and analysis of the proposed technique are done with different existing similarity measures on the basis of performance metrics purity and entropy.

Typical methods for edge detection like Sobel and Canny are robust and fast, but they are sensitive to noise. Soft computing techniques such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization (ACO), genetic algorithms (GA) and fuzzy logic system (FLS) have extensive application in edge detection of images because of their adaptive behavior. Edge detection is identifying the discontinuities in intensity of the pixel and grouping the contour of edges. The quality of edges in ACO-based edge detection majorly depends on the choice of constants, pheromone evaporation rate, number of iterations etc. In PSO-based edge detection, the quality of images depends on the values of acceleration coefficients and inertia weight. However, thresholding is major stakeholder in determining the fitness of the chromosomes. The population contains 2-D chromosomes. Fuzzy systems are most suitable for designing edge detection hardware. This paper presents a thorough comparative study of soft-computing-based edge detection techniques and highlights their key features. The factors affecting quality of edges are compared, and the actual outcomes of the approaches are systematically arranged for better understanding.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Mobile and Network Security', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

However, the system can be optimized with the help of higher hardware support and increased training datasets, which can help in more precise analysis for generating ligand molecules of interest.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

CCTV cameras are installed all over the places for surveillance and security. Many surveillance systems still require human supervision. Recent advances in computer vision are, thus, seen as an important trend in video surveillance that could lead to dramatic efficiency gains. Various public places like shopping malls, supermarkets, ATMs, banks, and other places, where CCTV cameras are available, are the places we should concentrate on. Security can be characterized in various terms in various settings like robbery distinguishing proof, brutality recognition, odds of a blast, and so on. In jam-packed public places, the term security covers practically a wide range of strange occasions. So, it is important and challenging to build a model which detects these abnormal activities and generates some kind of alert. We used a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) which involve the concept of deep neural networks. It extracts the spatial–temporal features of the images and calculates the Euclidean distance between the original and reconstructed batch of images. We converted the training videos into images to train the model and calculated the loss between the images to identify the abnormality. To validate the proposed algorithm, 4 datasets as HOLLYWOOD, UCF101, HMDB51, and WEIZMANN are used for action recognition. The proposed technique performs better than the existing one.

We provide a detailed comparative analysis of different filters that can be used in denoising images containing various noises, in this paper. Four different noises, Speckle, Salt and Pepper, Gaussian, and Poisson, have been considered and different filters like Bilateral, Wiener, Mean, and Median have been applied to images containing each of them. The different filtered output images have been compared with the original image using their structural similarity index.

Deploying Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) in such a large and resource-constrained environment is a challenging task. The resource-constrained nature of many devices and nodes restricts what tasks those nodes can realistically expect to perform. In this paper, we investigate the use of a meta-heuristic-based optimization method, namely a Genetic Algorithm (GA), to discover optimal IDS placements and configurations for Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to optimise IDS configurations for emerging and constrained networks while incorporating a much wider set of aspects than currently considered. The targets our approach seeks to optimise and balance are the detection rate, F 1 score, coverage, feasibility cost and deployment cost. We propose a framework that takes into consideration these functional and non-functional constraints.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Regarding this issue, there is a huge challenge in detecting the unusual events, if a person drives on a road it is normal event, but if the same person drives on pedestrian road it is not a normal event, there are many aspects to consider it as abnormal event, when it comes to normal surveillance it is impossible to understand which is abnormal and normal, only the video can be recorded but cannot classify the event, thus unusual event detection from surveillance is designed to classify the normal and abnormal events through anomaly detection process. Convolutional layers have showed potential in new applications of object detection and recognition mostly in images. Convolutional neural networks, on the other hand, are supervised and required labels to learn signals. Spatiotemporal recurrent neural network is used to learn the model by combining two primary components: spatial feature representation and temporal feature evolution.

With the advancements in attack generation techniques that provides realistic look for fake face presentations, it becomes a progressively challenging task. Hence, determining the root of bonafide or artificial face presentations has received a substantial attention. Recently, deep learning (DL) has made breakthroughs in the field of presentation attack detection (PAD) or face vitality detection (FVD). The DL-based face PAD approaches are better compared to traditional methods, as they do not require the user to choose the image features beforehand. Although, handcrafted feature-based techniques were the prominent ones over the past decades but since 2014, the research in this field is shifting toward the features extracted through deep neural networks. Hence, in this work, we present a review of various deep networks that are been successfully designed for face PAD mechanisms. It is well known that DL-based techniques, being able to extract significant patterns automatically, and deliver good detection accuracies in unknown attacking scenarios too. Additionally, the live face samples closed to a specific attack group such as makeup, obfuscation, and transparent mask has made the task of vitality detection as more challenging. The increased training overhead and the requirement of large training data is a trade-off for the substantial growth of these techniques. Consequently, the notion of transfer learning (TL) aims to transfer the existing learnt knowledge with larger dataset to new smaller database. Therefore, TL in face PAD mechanism is feasible solution that deserves more attention with an aim of increasing face vitality detection accuracies.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

The workload of each subject can be in interval form due to a few factors, for example the uncertain number of enrollment. The instructor interval requested workload has a specific interpretation where each instructor prefers to be assigned the left bound of the workload interval. This workload constraint semantic leads to a new type of interval assignment problem solution called the special tolerance left solution. We study the characteristics of the new solution and apply them to solving the course assignment problem with interval workload constraint. We illustrate the solution with a real life example.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Engineering']"

Epileptic seizure is known as the abrupt abnormal activity of a bunch of neurons which results in an electric surge in the brain. India is also one of the countries on the globe which is having about 10 million people suffering from a seizure. In this paper, the combination of discrete wavelet transform along with power spectral density is proposed for the classification and feature extraction process to detect epileptic seizures. To achieve high accuracy of seizure detection rate and explore relevant knowledge from the EEG processed dataset, deep learning has been used. The result shows that the detection of epileptic seizures using the proposed method gives an accuracy of 90.1%. This system would be useful for clinical analysis of epileptic seizures, and appropriate action would be taken against epileptic seizures.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

An individual user has complete control over the data and operations in his or her machine. On the other hand, there is CC, in which the operation and data preservation are given by a vendor, leaving the client/customer oblivious of where the activities are operating or where the information is saved. As a result, the customer has no management control over it. The Internet is used as a communication medium in CC. When it comes to data security in the cloud, the vendor must provide some guarantee in service level agreements (SLA) to persuade the user on privacy concerns. As a result, the SLA must specify several degrees of security. Their complexities are based on the services in order for the customer to comprehend the security measures that are in operation. Regardless of the supplier, there must be a defined method for preparing the SLA. The results obtained here indicates management of the SLAs using the Vitrage plugin of the Open stack public cloud eco-system. The results readings were based on the CPU utility of the cloud IaaS resources. The proposed approach shows how the prediction of the resources are managed in real-time when the occurrence of the attack will be identified.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Mobile and Network Security', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In this proposed method, we are using a promising way of speeding up the training by using representative frames from each video for the entire video data set. The advantage is that the training time can be drastically decreased with the compact input video data. Here we are using the inceptionv3 pretrained model for classification where the weights and architecture can be used for similar types of inputs. Instead of giving the entire video frames for video classification, the proposed method, selects representative frames only, still producing comparable results. When used with ‘action recognition data set’ having 101 classes and 13,320 videos, while using full frames, it gives a F 1 -score of 0.717 and while using representative frames, it results with a 0.704 value which is comparable. When all the frames of the videos are given as input to the pretrained model, the performance is considerably high. However, there is a direct implication on the cost as far as time is concerned. The main objective of this research work is to enhance the computational efficiency of the video classifier by using the representative frames for speeding up the process of training the data set.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Mobile and Network Security', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.

However, due to the difficulty of network training, there exist few studies about the applications of SNN in brain-computer interface (BCI), especially in the four-classification task of motor imagery (MI). In this study, we develop a four-layer SNN structure to solve the MI four-classification problem. Firstly, an improved optimization algorithm for Ben’s spiker algorithm (BSA) is presented to convert EEG signals into spike signals, which obtains about 50 times higher efficiency than the commonly used optimizing algorithms. Secondly, a SNN combined with spike long-short-time-memory (LSTM) module is proposed to perform four-classification tasks in MI. Finally, we introduce the channel-wise normalization strategy to facilitate the training of deeper layers. Our experiment on the publicly released dataset achieves the accuracy that is comparable to the previous work of one-Dimension convolution neural network (1D-CNN). Meanwhile, the number of parameters of proposed network is about 1/10 of that in 1D-CNN.

A large population of interconnected devices (i.e. Internet of Things (IoT)) acting as local learners optimize the model parameters collectively (e.g., neural networks’ weights), rather than sharing and disclosing the training data set with the server. FL approaches assume each participant has enough training data for the tasks of interest. Realistically, data collected by IoT devices may be insufficient and often unlabeled. In particular, each IoT device may only contain one or a few samples of every relevant data category, and may not have the time or interest to label them. In realistic applications, this severely limits FL’s practicality and usability. In this paper, we propose a One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) framework considering a FL scenario wherein the local training is carried out on IoT devices and the global aggregation is done at the level of an edge server. Moreover, we combine model-free reinforcement learning with OSFL to design a more intelligent IoT device to infer whether to label a sample automatically or request the true label for the one-shot learning set-up.

Our original model KerasBERT has since been expanded by adding more data and re-training the language model. The original KerasBERT model was trained on two categories of Keras Code Examples and the Keras API reference. This chapter documents adding Keras GitHub Examples, Kaggle Notebook containing Keras Code, Medium articles describing how to use Keras, and StackOverflow questions regarding Keras. With these new data sources, we present new domain generalization analysis, as well as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) test set losses. We qualitatively evaluate how well KerasBERT learns the Keras Deep Learning framework through cloze test evaluation. We present miscellaneous properties of these cloze tests such as mask positioning and prompt paraphrasing. KerasBERT is an 80 million parameter RoBERTa model, which we compare to the Zero-Shot learning capability of the 6 billion parameter GPT-Neo model. We present a suite of cloze tests crafted from the Keras documentation to evaluate these models. We find some exciting completions that show KerasBERT is a promising direction for question answering and schema-free database querying. In this chapter, we document the reuse of KerasBERT and integration of additional data sources. We have tripled the size of the original data set and have identified five main sources of Keras information data. With these sources, we present new analyses of how models generalize to novel sources of data, such as a language model trained on Kaggle notebooks and tested on GitHub code.

In various real-world circumstances, class-imbalanced datasets arise, where the number of data samples in a class is not equal to the other class. To develop good classification models based on present level calculations, using these datasets is difficult, particularly for separating minority classes from the majority class. To address the issue of class imbalance, under/oversampling procedures are used to minimize and enhance the quantities of data examined in minority and majority class.

The tremendous growth of breast cells forms tumors that sense as lumps. Generally, two categories are most important Benign (non-cancerous) and Malignant (cancerous). In medical science, different treatment strategies are there to identify which kind of tumor it is (Benign or Malignant). Image tests (X-rays, CT scan), ultrasound, MRI, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immune therapy, surgery, biopsy are the most common techniques that are used in hospitals depending upon different stages of lumps which is very important but expensive in breast cancer detection. As a solution in our paper, we have discussed a comparison-based analysis of different machine learning approaches on Wisconsin Breast Cancer (WBC) dataset for measuring the variance (deviation between training accuracy and test accuracy) for early detection of breast cancer. But the question is what happens when the dataset is noisy or binary classification (Benign or Malignant) is crucial. Support vector machine (SVM) is an improvement over accuracy measure with respect to others. Binary classification is not possible always for higher-dimensional data, sometimes data that is not separable in 2D may be separable in 3D or higher dimension using transformation known as Kernel trick.

UAVs have applications in emergency rescue missions, surveillance, package delivery, and weather and traffic management. UAVs can also be used to improve the characteristics of wireless or mobile communication technologies. It can also be used as a wireless access point in wireless ground communications. To turn the above applications into reality, UAV requires control over wireless transmission channels to operate remotely and safely. The radio propagation standard characteristics in which it operates are entirely different from the conventional ground users (GUEs). Considering all these challenges, studies have been taking place with the aim of cooperating with UAV communication in today’s wireless mobile networks. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces are emerging hardware technology that can be used to improve transmission medium characteristics and improve energy efficiency. RIS can be used in wireless networks to generate a smart radio environment. By using RIS, it enables the user to configure the transmission of electromagnetic waves in a user-programmable manner. RIS can receive radio signals from the transmitter and beamform inactively toward the receiver by inciting a manageable phase shift. This increases the signal energy and improves the data rate also. RIS can control the wireless transmission channels partially and provide us with more favorable propagation characteristics.

A single classifier algorithm will be compared against the performance and efficiency of ensemble classifiers. Reducing student attrition is a major problem for educational institutions all over the world. The search for solutions to increase student retention and graduation rates continues for educators. This is only possible if at-risk students are identified and intervened with as soon as possible. However, the majority of regularly used prediction models are inefficient and inaccurate as a result of inherent classifier limitations and the inclusion of insignificant inputs in their calculations. The majority of data mining and machine learning researcher focused on developing an algorithm that can extract useful information from massive amounts of data after being processed by a computer. The most difficult problem in predictive modelling is identifying the most effective prediction algorithms that are also accurate enough to be useful. Therefore, a multi-level homogeneous ensemble predictive (MLHoEP) model is designed, which uses the different techniques of data mining like feature selection, ensemble learning techniques like boosting and bagging. Seven distinct machine learning algorithms were used on this model to predict and analyse the academic performance of the students. The performance of the classification algorithms in terms of prediction was evaluated using k -fold cross-validation. The study contributes to the body of knowledge by suggesting the development of homogeneous classifiers that may be used to accurately predict students’ academic success. It also proposes the construction of homogeneous classifiers, which may be deployed for accurate student performance prediction, in order to provide a better explanation for the poor performance prediction. As a result of this research, it has been demonstrated that the technique of applying homogeneous ensemble approaches is incredibly efficient and accurate in terms of predicting student performance and assisting in identifying students, who are in danger of dropping out of school. The study compared the accuracy and efficiency of single classifiers to ensembles of classifiers in terms of performance. It was discovered in the research that a homogeneous model with excellent accuracy and efficiency might be developed for anticipating student performance. These key problems have been successfully addressed by the findings of this research study: Which characteristics of students are the most effective predictors of academic performance? How accurate are approaches such as bagging and boosting ensembles for predicting student academic performance? The approach offered in this study will aid educational administrators and policymakers in designing new policies and curriculum-linked to student retention in higher education. This research can also aid in the identification of students who are at risk of dropping out of school early, providing for timely intervention and support. Prospective research will examine the creation and implementation of an automated prediction system known as the students’ academic performance forecast framework, which will collect data from students via online submission and produce a prediction result for their academic performance.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

A country like India has a lot of diversity; different transport operators use their infrastructure and utilities to provide services. Urban transports are gaining more fame every day as most people use them; they offer good fare rates with reduced time than private transport. But the major problem comes when an individual wants to use it, but doesn’t know which route to take to reach the destination. As most of these operators do not have route optimization and route recommendation facility, giving a bad user travel experience. This paper aims to solve the routing problem in urban transport using a modified two-way Breadth-first search algorithm. It is a stable uninformed graph search algorithm and guarantees optimal solution; our solution solves the problem of routes and aims to reduce the response time to front-end applications when our algorithm is used. We presented a lightweight approach for route recommendations that individual transport operators can use their transportation network to overcome this. Dijkstra’s algorithm is traditionally used for shortest-path calculation that uses the concept of Breadth-first search that guarantees optimal solutions. BFS searches from source to destination, it is slow in graphs with a high branching factor. We introduce a parallel hybrid two-way BFS variant that simultaneously starts BFS from both ends, i.e., source and destination. This variant uses BFS top-down approach, and we add it to a bottom-up parallel pipeline, and as a result, we get a novel approach for route recommendation. We implemented this approach on the BEST Mumbai transportation dataset, analyzed the performance with the existing Dijkstra algorithm, and achieved improvements.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Statistics, general']"

The number of patients infected by this deadly virus increases steadily, causing a high mortality rate. Hence, it is crucial to diagnose and identify the COVID-19 infection for earlier treatment of the patients. This study has applied four algorithms, namely, Logistic Regression (LR), Nu-Support Vector Machine (Nu-SVM), Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and Naive Bayes (NB) to identify COVID-19 infection. The clinical laboratory findings of 600 individuals were taken from Hospital Isrelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil, used in this study. We have selected significant features using Random forest-based recursive feature elimination for predicting the infection. Experiments are conducted with 90% training and 10% testing data. The performance result shows that the Nu-SVM algorithm obtained the prediction accuracy of 95% with 100% sensitivity and 94.23% specificity in predicting the infection. To our knowledge, the result achieved by Nu-SVM is the highest in the literature. Hence, the model can be used as a tool for the initial prediction of COVID-19 disease.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

Version control system (VCS) Rather than forcing the developers into editing multi-variant artifacts of an SPL, SuperMod allows them to perform modifications successively in single-variant workspaces and to integrate the changes by indicating the logical scope, i.e., the affected variants, of the change performed. The SPL itself is managed automatically in a transparent repository by the system. As a consequence, developers may re-use the same engineering tools they also used for the development of the product variants prior to the re-engineering process. SuperMod furthermore orchestrates collaborative development and provides dedicated support for (without restricting developers to) model-driven approaches to SPL engineering. We illustrate SuperMod’s capabilities by the well-known graph SPL example and discuss the practical benefits of the suggested solution to SPL evolution as well as its relation to SPL re-engineering.","['Computer Science', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Software Management', 'Computer System Implementation']"

Its role is to derive an analytic estimation of the outputs expected for given inputs based on observed input-output data. The objective function that is optimized within the regression model is generally the representation of the approximation error comparing to the observed data. Nowadays, the uncertainty is commonly taken into consideration when modeling real systems, and vectorizing information is an important aspect of addressing big data in computer science. Consequently, finding pertinent fuzzy regression models is of great importance within mathematical modeling. In this paper we report our findings related to the full use of the extension principle in solving the optimization model comprised in a least square fuzzy linear regression methodology. We propose a solution approach based on mathematical programming to estimate the fuzzy outputs of the observed fuzzy data; and group our experiments in two categories with respect to the crispness of the observed input data. The first category uses crisp input data and is considered to better explain the advantage of using the extension principle within the solution approach; while the second category, having fuzzy both input and output observed data, is included to prove the relevance of the new approach compared to methodologies from the recent literature.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Computational Intelligence']"

However, it is difficult to identify which sources are reliable and which are disseminating false information. So far, many models have been derived to detect fake news or misinformation from social media news using machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) techniques. This chapter aims to enhance the detection accuracy by representing the text of social media news in a hybrid format using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. We model the input data of news text in a hybrid representation using TF-IDF with N -grams model combined with Latent Semantic Indexing. The main objective of the hybrid text representation is to represent news text by considering the three important factors of text, viz. the important words in the text, their sequence of occurrence, and their semantic meaning. We applied different ML and DL techniques for news classification and compared the performance of fake news detection models with and without hybrid text representation. The obtained results evidence that there is a significant improvement in detection accuracies when the news text is represented in a hybrid format as proposed in our approach.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Sociology, general', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Machine Learning']"

Moreover, the dynamic disguise activities of publishers make the task harder to investigate the actual status labels of the publishers, resulting in less accurate predictions. However, features reported in the literature detect click fraud based on analyzing the publishers’ conduct but are unable to cope with the changing behavior of publishers. Therefore, we proposed a framework addressing two challenging issues: a) eight new conditional features are proposed to better capture the dynamics of click fraud behavior by merging two or more attributes over publishers on finer-grained time intervals. b) Examined the impact of data sampling methods on learners’ performance for the effective identification of publisher’s activity. The performance of the classification algorithms is assessed using average precision, recall, and f-measure and validated using 10-fold cross-validation. Experimental results illustrate the potential of the proposed features over a balanced dataset in improving the average precision of the learners in discriminating the fraudsters among genuine publishers.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Management']"

Further, variables that limit the automation potential for current cybersecurity roles are reviewed. Based on a well-established and widely adopted reference resource that lists typical skill requirements and duties of cybersecurity workers, an assessment of the susceptibility for automation of cybersecurity work was performed by an expert panel. All cybersecurity work descriptions were ranked in terms of proneness for automation according to four criteria: requirements for creativity, social interaction, physical work, and the existence of relevant statistical training data. It was found that technical roles, for example database administrators and data analysts, are easiest to automate. Roles associated with management and accountability, for example, legal advisors and cyber operations planners, are more difficult to automate. Finally, requirements for physical work is a negligible factor when it comes to cybersecurity work automation.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Privacy', 'Cryptology', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

As RL agents further integrate with our society, they must learn to comply with ethical, social, or legal norms. Defeasible deontic logics are natural formal frameworks to specify and reason about such norms in a transparent way. However, their effective and efficient integration in RL agents remains an open problem. On the other hand, linear temporal logic (LTL) has been successfully employed to synthesize RL policies satisfying, e.g., safety requirements. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which the established machinery for safe reinforcement learning can be leveraged for directing normative behaviour for RL agents. We analyze some of the difficulties that arise from attempting to represent norms with LTL, provide an algorithm for synthesizing LTL specifications from certain normative systems, and analyze its power and limits with a case study.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The main motivation behind using deep learning methods for community detection comes from the brilliant performance results shown by deep neural networks in various fields. Using unsupervised learning models, the problem of community detection can be solved. The high-dimensional feature space representation of the network data leads to a complex neural network architecture that requires a high number of trainable parameters. Deep learning-based models can transform the high-dimensional graph data of complex networks into simple, low-dimensional space or latent representation. The transformation of network representation to latent representation consists of meaningful features of the network data. This mapping preserves the structural information of the network later on, which clustering algorithms can be applied to the converted latent representation. This survey paper provides an overview of the traditional and deep learning-based methods of community detection, followed by a discussion on the challenges and future directions of community detection.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It is helpful finding and deciding about which pixel belong to which objects. It is the process of making pixels of every region has similar visual characteristics. The watershed algorithm provides a complementary approach to the segmentation of an object. It is essential for segmenting objects where they touch their boundaries. Watershed is a dividing ridge between drainage areas. In digital image processing, the banks are the watershed lines and the drainage areas are catchment basins. Watershed is the representation of the grayscale image as topographic relief. Watersheds with adjacent catchment basins are being built during the repeated flooding of the gray value relief. This flooding method is performed on the gradient image. The magnitude of gradient value is intensely sensitive to image noise. So noise value plays a vital role in watershed processing. In computer-world watershed is a classical algorithm used for image segmentation.

During the emergence of a disaster or crisis social media has become a significant means of communication. The widespread use of mobile phones and other forms of communication allows individuals to express and alert others about real-life disasters. Such knowledge relating to disasters spread over the media could save thousands of individuals by warning others and allowing them to take the required actions. It is being worked on by many firms to analyze tweets and observe tweets relating to disasters and emergencies using programming. Such efforts may be useful to loads of people using the internet. However, this effort has other problems, such as detecting and distinguishing catastrophe tweets from non-disaster tweets. Often the data available in twitter is not structured so processing is to be done on the data to classify data as ‘disaster’ and ‘non-disaster’. This paper deals with developing a model that can tell if a user is sharing data about a disaster. The data set used includes 10,000 tweets along with classifiers. This Optimized SVM model pre-processes the data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and then builds the classifier model that gives maximum accuracy.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Mobile and Network Security', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.

As community identification task involves identifying important people and their linkages, social network analysis is one such technique to analyse complex networks such as criminal networks. Keeping in view the diversity of actors and gangs involved in crime activities, the goal is to investigate and assess their characteristics so that the essential information characterising their behaviour is extracted. The current work will employ a social network analysis-based novel approach called sentiment analysis on influential nodes (SAOIN) to attain this important goal. Our approach claims to be computationally efficient as only the influential nodes (aka leaders) of the established subnetworks (communities) are taken into consideration for further investigation rather than inquiring each and every actor of a network. This discerns our model from other already existing community identifying techniques. The proposed model generates small subnetworks that can be used to discover the list of actors and their relationships that need to be inquired further, As opposed to other already existing community detecting methods that generates larger and much complex networks. This study inquires actors of the social network like Twitter whose activities promotes criminal propaganda across diverse stages. The information dissemination among these actors directs sole insight towards their behaviours.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']"

These reviews give an abstraction to the readers about a particular hotel. Somehow, the readers may get confused on choosing the right hotel due to ambiguity in many reviews. Sentiment classification methods will be used to differentiate the positive and negative sentiments. However, each hotel review might have a binary statement which makes it difficult to identify whether the statement is positive or negative. In order to tackle the ambiguity, the tokenized sentences are considered. Naïve Bayes classifier, a supervised machine learning algorithm, is applied to recognize the features and to classify the reviews into positive or negative. Then, the proposed framework will be implemented as a Web application using open-source methodologies and micro frameworks. The dashboard of the Web application comprises three areas, namely data, recommendation and a plot. Data shows the reviews along with the classified sentiments of the selected hotel. Recommendation part shows the levels of recommendations for the selected hotel, and the plot shows the positive and negative statements of that particular hotel.

Recent studies have identified nutrition virtual coaching systems (NVC) as a technological solution, possibly bridging technologies such as recommender, informative, persuasive, and argumentation systems. Enabling NVC to explain recommendations and discuss (argument) dietary solutions and alternative items or behaviors is crucial to improve the transparency of these applications and enhance user acceptability and retain their engagement. This study primarily focuses on virtual agents personalizing the generation of food recipes recommendation according to users’ allergies, eating habits, lifestyles, nutritional values, etc. Although the agent would nudge the user to consume healthier food, users may tend to object in favor of tastier food. To resolve this divergence, we propose a user-agent negotiation interacting over the revision of the recommendation (via feedback and explanations) or convincing (via explainable arguments) the user of its benefits and importance. Finally, the paper presents our initial findings on the acceptability and usability of such a system obtained via tests with real users.

Text based passwords have been the choice for authentication over the years, but many security threats and vulnerabilities are reported now. Researchers and academicians have suggested many alternatives with some advantages and limitations. It has been noted that few alternative methods are very promising but very complicated to implement hence they have not been adopted in real life applications. Keeping this in mind, a simple, innovative and easily implementable method for user authentication as an alternative of text-based passwords is proposed in this paper. User needs to upload an image of his choice as a sign-up process initially. This image is analysed by server and decomposed into many components. When the user wants to get access to the system next time, the server gives him a challenge to arrange all the image components in a sequence. These image components are randomly jumbled and server plays an intelligent role here. Based on the pattern and log in attempt by user, server can increase or decrease number of image components based on an algorithm and it enhances the randomness and security level of the authentication process. The server learns about variations gradually and in case of any suspicious activity, server can instruct the user to change the image which acts as a password. The test results and security analysis along with proposed method is discussed here in order to prove the feasibility and validity of the proposed method. It is believed that the proposed method has the strength to replace text-based passwords and the method can be incorporated with various machine learning based cryptographic procedures which will enhance the overall utility of the proposed work.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Management']"

The relationship can be determined by frequency of interactions, propagation, and cultural activities and strong/week ties in social network. The structure of social network characterizes in terms of nodes (individual actors, people, or a thing within the network), ties, edges and links. The node is to be optimized to improve the link availability, clique through rate, effectiveness of link usage. The node optimization could be achieved by optimization of links. There are many predicting techniques are used to predict the nodes decision to improve the ‘influence propagation’ and ‘retrieve information’ from the requested users. The existing link prediction algorithms are based by the performance of the community’s with multiple parameters in the social network environment, and each parameter has to be quantified for best trade among the links. Hence, a node proximity clustering (NPC) algorithm has considered multi-dimensional parameters along with node weight value to quantify the importance value of the link prediction. The performance of the designed algorithm has been experimented in the various scenarios. The node proximity clustering algorithm (NPC) has been experimented in the defined environment with the fast greedy (FG), binomial (B), and socio rank (SR) of prediction algorithms. The results had been compared and analyzed. The proved algorithm has yielded 97.66% accuracy.

The core idea behind this optimality is to provide green time for dynamic traffic flow changes in urban areas. As the vehicles are waiting in the queue during red light time, an effective control system is required to reduce the waiting time. In a fixed time/conventional traffic system green light is turned on for a fixed time in each direction. Such systems are generally pre-programmed or the fixed delay in each direction can be controlled manually and hence requires a human operator to make the desired changes, as and when required. Also, a human operator will change this for a limited number of times in a day. However, this process can be automated by using fuzzy control systems. In the fuzzy controlled traffic systems, the on time of green light is adjusted (during each transition of traffic lights) depending on the different input parameters such as Queue length, Time of the day, Arrival Rate and Waiting Time, etc. Adjustment in number of transitions indicates the flexibility/adaptive nature of fuzzy controlled system. In this paper, the novelty in the field of traffic engineering is introduced by computing the relative significance of identified parameters. Various fuzzy models with three input parameters, i.e., Arrival rate, Queue length and Waiting Time are implemented and comparative performance analysis of the seven fuzzy models hence obtained, is presented. The performance of all the implemented fuzzy models is also compared with the conventional traffic system. A traffic simulator is implemented in MATLAB to generate the real-time traffic conditions, each system is simulated and compared for all possible combinations of traffic density. Fuzzy model with two input parameters Queue length and Waiting Time outperforms the other systems and provides 23.69% average improvement in the delay observed by the vehicles waiting in the queue.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

IoT can control and access daily usable devices and equipment with an internet connection. Smart technology provides a connected infrastructure to heterogeneous devices like IP cameras, cell phones, cars, home appliances, and industrial equipment for autonomous communication and interaction. The great perspective of IoT infrastructure comes with more security challenges. The multiplication of IoT gadgets it can be more easily negotiated than personal computers has led to intensification in the IoT-based botnet attacks. These IoT devices need to ensure the security and privacy of sensitive information and network communication. In the public channel, an adversary can damage the transferred information for unauthorized activities on applications. To moderate this hazard, there is a necessity for new procedures that diagnose the threats dispatched from exchanged IoT appliances and that are dispersed amongst all IoT-based attacks. We discuss the bio-inspired-based attack discovery techniques for IoT botnet attacks and network traffic from hacked IoT gadgets. This paper aims to review the existing attack detection approaches that have been used to address the security issues on IoT applications. In this work, bio-inspired computing models were independently trained to detect and mitigate the Mirai botnet attacks on IoT applications.

And so, for the last few years, many online environments have been developed to help kids acquire the coding skills needed in the 21st century in a fun and interactive way. This paper uses a mixed approach to investigate elementary students’ performance in programming after engaging in a 2-week online programme using the Tynker platform. The data was collected through observations and surveys. Children used Blockly programming (Python-based) to create animated stories, collages, and games. At the end of the program, the learners were assessed by a multiple-choice quiz. Additionally, they created a project that covered all the concepts covered during the program. Successful examples from classroom observations are drawn to illustrate how students make practical use of the Tynker platform. Additionally, 117 closed-question surveys were analysed to determine the students’ accurate perceptions about the coding and online platform. The interpretation of the findings implies that the students’ programming knowledge acquisition follows a progressive path. However, the findings show that while all students learned the basics of coding, there were some differences in performance and understanding. This paper bridges the gap related to the insufficient attention in educational research towards teaching coding to primary students. The findings would help stakeholders to develop more capacity-building training programmes for young learners.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering']"

Still, in current teaching methods, students learn the same content, the same way, and at the same rate. This pedagogical perspective in learning has attracted researchers and professionals for years to describe how learning occurs and whether the findings can be theorized. These methods do not provide the most effective learning experience as it is more teacher oriented than student oriented. The lack of personal approach and immediate personal feedback result in a “one size fit all” paradigm of learning. Moreover, with modern mobile devices which are owned by most students, learning could easily be extended outside the classroom as smartphones remove all the time and distance barriers previously attached to learning. This research presents a novel rule-based adaptive mobile application to learn Android in a personalized learning environment. The mobile application was developed using Android Studio and Google’s Firebase as cloud infrastructure to provide an easy way of representing data through the JSON database while ensuring smooth performance and high bandwidth. The adaptive feature of the system was achieved through a custom inference engine that was used with forward chaining for knowledge propagation. Factors considered for content adaptation include learning style, current knowledge, learner responses, and weaknesses. The results obtained were very promising and demonstrated that the proposed system dynamically adapts to the learner’s needs while he/she is learning and makes the learning process more engaging and effective.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

The videos captured by a camera are prone to various distortions such as noise, smoke, haze, low or uneven illumination, blur, rain, and compression, which affect visual quality. Automatic identification of distortions is important when enhancing video quality. Video quality assessment involves two stages: (1) classification of distortions affecting the video frames and (2) ranking of these distortions. A novel video dataset was utilized for training, validating, and testing. Working with this dataset was challenging because it included nine categories of distortions and four levels of severity. The greatest challenge was the availability of multiple types of distortions in the same video. The work presented in this paper addresses the problem of multi-label distortion classification and ranking. A vision transformer was used for feature learning. The experiment showed that the proposed solution performed well in terms of F1 score of single distortion (77.9%) and F1 score of single and multiple distortions (69.9%). Moreover, the average accuracy of level classification was 62% with an average F1 score of 61%.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computers and Education', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.

In this paper we focus on expansions of an AF where solely the addition of new arguments and attacks is allowed and the original framework remains unchanged. Existing results about the enforcement problem under strong and normal expansion are all sufficient conditions. We argue that necessary and sufficient conditions are essential concerning the solvability of the enforcement problem. Specifically, two necessary and sufficient conditions are identified for the non-strict enforcement in respectively the odd-length cycle free and the even-length cycle free AFs under strong expansion. This result can be used to determine that when new arguments satisfying the condition are unavailable, enforcing the desired set simply becomes unsolvable.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

From the beginning of the COVID-19 vaccination program, many people have refused to accept the vaccine due to widespread misconceptions and propaganda concerning the COVID-19 virus itself, whether it is real or not, and the vaccination program as well. All these misconceptions and propaganda have been spreading through word of mouth (verbal) discussion among citizens. In this study, a hybrid machine learning approach was proposed with the help of natural language processing to build a sentiment classification and prediction system using the data collected from the public regarding their opinions on the COVID-19 vaccination program. The data was collected through the Google Form. The evaluation metrics used to measure the effectiveness of the proposed work were accuracy, precision, recall, and f-measure. Various machine learning algorithms were used for the implementation. Two algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine and Bagging Classifier, outperformed the remaining algorithms with the same accuracy and precision scores of 75%, respectively. The two algorithms were considered for the voting, which served as the final hybrid machine learning model for the sentiment classification and prediction tasks. The voting classifier works by predicting an output voting class based on the highest likelihood of the combined models, which were Bagging Classifier and SVM. Using the voting classifier, accuracy, and precision scores of 75% and 75% were also obtained.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

When the datasets have a lesser amount of missing attribute values in the entire database, the missing attribute values be able to remove from the dataset without taking a noteworthy influence on the final mine. However, if a huge number of attribute values are missing, suspicious attention should be given to handle these kinds missing data because the entire dataset will lose their valuable information and the quality of the datasets. In particular, datasets have more than one missing attribute value disturb the algorithms performance. Missing value imputation method’s aim is to provide high-quality dataset without loss of any valuable information intelligently where the missing values are smaller or larger. Meanwhile ensemble learning techniques are achieving high performance in data mining task for the past few years. Researchers, therefore, prefer to work on the imputation of missing data using ensemble learning, a technique that cannot be ignored nowadays because missing data in bioinformatics datasets are rapidly increasing. Ensemble learning aim is transforms from weak learner to strong learner. Those ensemble techniques can process a massive amount of data in an efficient manner. This paper concentrates on the review of missing value imputation techniques and ensemble learning models for analyzing biological data.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

This approach offers an alternative to conventional university entrance criteria, establishing a means to better advice prospect university students on which degree streamline they are best suited for based on their displayed abilities. This will assist in the measures taken to reduce student attrition at universities. Student skill-sets are composed of pre-college marks (high school leaving results and National Benchmark Test scores) and home language. The composition of skill-sets is based on key student abilities associated with student university performance, and these are characterised as follows: mathematical ability, computer proficiency, academic literacy and language communication. The best performing prediction model proved to be the random forest classifier which gave an accuracy of 95%. This research, conducted at a South African research intensive institute, shows that skill-sets can be used as an alternative to current university entrance requirements as they provide a more holistic view of a student’s ability. With the advent of machine learning, this study also demonstrates the capabilities of data mining in education as viable solutions to the student attrition problem with skill-sets giving a more holistic representation of the students capabilities making for better classification predictions.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Attendance is an important governing factor to let institutions decide whether students would appear for various end term examinations, collaborative projects, national international hackathons and a lot number of in/out-house activities. It also controls students’ performance in various national and international endeavors related to placements, internships, etc., outside the institution. So there has always been a dire need to develop a high performing efficient attendance monitoring system. Various software’s are already available which follow the traditional software development methodology, i.e., the waterfall approach. Since the inception of a new approach of software development called extreme programming methodology, one of the best practices called test-driven development (TDD) is replacing customary development extensively. TDD methodology addresses various issues related to the efficiency and usefulness of software developed through customary waterfall approach. The work in this research work proposes a tool AMC tdd which blends TDD with the looping articulation method. Looping articulation method further improves the efficiency of TDD approach. The concept of looping articulation with TDD is new to the development of attendance monitoring system software. The proposed tool is compared with various similar existing tools, and the results are quite promising in terms of quality attributes governing software. Two groups of students are taken with the same grade (same caliber). One group uses the traditional approach, and another group adopts the proposed tool AMC tdd . The discipline size is kept same in both the groups to maintain the consistency of results. The results obtained through the proposed tool are much more promising as compared to similar work done in the literature till now.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']"

Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm often used in topic modelling. The output of the topic modelling algorithm can be used logically to classify documents. The LDA model is plagued with domain-specific terms. A novel latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with domain knowledge framework for document classification was introduced. The experiment was carried out using a dataset with five different categories of data. The experiments showed that LDA with domain knowledge gives better results than standard LDA and LDA using the TF-IDF model.

Everyone is working toward improving information and tries to consider it as a ladder to move forward. Data is the main object to get information, and data is considered as a big data nowadays as it contains numerous information in all directions. As knowledge is bliss, it is also possible that an adversary can use this information to harm an individual. To protect data from an adversary privacy preserving data publishing techniques is used. But when multiple sensitive data present in a data set which is correlated to each other’s several model are unable to protect data in an efficient way. In this paper, a novel model K-MNSOA is proposed for privacy preserving data publishing, which protect sensitive data privacy breach, even if the data set contains multiple sensitive numerical overlapped attributes. A proposed model assumes that all sensitive attributes are not actually sensitive, so when data is protected, information loss will increase. To overcome this issue, new model suggests to divide sensitive data into levels of sensitivity and apply generalization only for the privacy of high sensitive attribute.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The main aim of the proposed method is to reduce the requirement for bulk training images to learn a supervised Deep neural network for semantic segmentation of cardiac structure. The proposed framework consists of two components, namely, a prototype learner and a supervised segmentor. The prototype learner generates a prototype for each type (class) of the cardiac structure, and the segmentor uses a U-Net architecture for segmentation and labeling of such structures. The prototype learner updates the parameters of feature extractor module by classifying the query set using K-nearest neighbor classifier and the support set. The output of the prototype learner (i.e., prototype) provides prior information about the classes. This output is fused with the output of the encoder of U-Net with an expectation that such a fusion will catalyze the learning process of the U-Net segmentor. Through training of the segmentor, the parameters of the encoding layer of U-Net get fine-tuned in a way so that it gradually aligns with the annotated segmentation maps. Probabilistic fusion model is used to amalgamate the prototypes with the generated features obtained from the encoder layer of the U-Net. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiment was carried out on CAMUS dataset of 450 patients and performance is compared with those of four state-of-the-art techniques. To evaluate the performance of each of the methods, DICE index of endocardium, epicardium and atrium have been considered.

FLPs defined on graphs are very general and broadly applicable. Two such fundamental FLPs are the Vertex K -Center (VKC) and the Vertex K -Median (VKM) problems. Although both these problems are NP-hard, many heuristic and approximation algorithms have been developed for solving them in practice. However, state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms require the input graph G to be complete, in which the edge joining two vertices is also the shortest path between them. When G doesn’t satisfy this property, these heuristic algorithms have to be invoked only after computing the metric closure of G , which in turn requires the computation of all-pairs shortest-path (APSP) distances. Existing APSP algorithms, such as the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, have a poor time complexity, making APSP computations a bottleneck for deploying the heuristic algorithms on large VKC and VKM instances. To remedy this, we propose the use of a novel algorithmic pipeline based on a graph embedding algorithm called FastMap. FastMap is a near-linear-time algorithm that embeds the vertices of G in a Euclidean space while approximately preserving the shortest-path distances as Euclidean distances for all pairs of vertices. The FastMap embedding can be used to circumvent the barrier of APSP computations, creating a very efficient pipeline for solving FLPs. On the empirical front, we provide test results that demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our novel approach.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Finally, we found the root-mean-square error with the various number of recommendations of our proposed approach thirty times and noted the average. We observed that the cosine similarity measure works better than a few other popular measures like Euclidean distance by 14.99% when the number of top recommendations is five.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Statistics, general', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

Human beings rely heavily on their perceptions. When making a choice, other people’s perspectives are taken into account. Currently, billions of Internet users communicate their opinions on several disciplines via journals, discussion forums, and social media sites. Companies and institutions are constantly interested in hearing what the general public thinks regarding their services and goods. It is critical in e-commerce and e-tourism to dynamically evaluate the vast number of user data available on the Internet; as a result, it is essential to establish ways for analysing and classifying it. Opinion mining, also known as sentiment classification, autonomously extracts opinions, views, and feelings through literature, audio, and data inputs using natural language processing. This paper provides an understanding of the machine learning strategies for classifying comments and opinions. This paper compares various machine learning-based opinion mining techniques such as Naive Bayes, SVM, genetic algorithm, decision tree, etc.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It is still a challenging task in computer vision due to its high intra-class variation, head pose, suitable environment conditions like lighting and illumination factors in behaviour prediction and recommendation systems. This paper proposes a novel facial emotion representation approach based on dense descriptors for recognizing facial dynamics on image sequences. Initially, the face is detected using the Haar cascade classifer to extract the temporal information from the facial frame by applying a scale invariant feature transform by combining a bag of visual words. Later, the extracted high-level features are fed to machine learning algorithms to classify the seven emotions from the MUG dataset. The proposed dense SIFT clustering performance was evaluated on four different machine learning algorithms and achieved a high rate of recognition accuracy in all classes. In the experimental results, K-NN exhibits the proposed architecture’s effectiveness with an accuracy rate of 91.8% for the MUG dataset, 89% for SVM, 87.6% for Naive Bayes, and 85.7% decision tree, respectively.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Statistics, general', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

Scenario reached a situation where people in search of worthy information for public health and precaution, getting fake news. This unprecedented expansion of fake information has become a challenging research issue. Deliberate efforts have been attempted in this manuscript for finding a solution to this COVID-19 fake news detection problem with the help of deep learning models. Two deep learning models—BERT, a transfer learning model, and attention-based bi-directional long short-term memory (LSTM), a memory-based model, have been applied in order to get accurate fake news classification outcomes. A comparative outcome of both models is presented which shows BERT outperforms and gives excellent results in comparison to the attention-based bi-directional LSTM model. The achieved training accuracy by BERT is 86% which is much higher than the accuracy achieved by attention-based Bi-LSTM. BERT precision, recall, and F-score are 0.82, 0.79, and 0.80, respectively, which shows that BERT can detect COVID-19 fake news better than the attention-based Bi-LSTM model.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

If the prediction of disease is possible at an early stage, then the risk factors associated with diabetes can be considerably lower in severity. The main problem and highly challenging task are to predict diabetes accurately, and the reason of this challenge is the diabetes dataset’s insufficient number of labels data and the existence of outliers. This research paper proposes a strong framework to predict the disease with the help of different types of machine learning (ML) algorithms: K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision trees (DTs), Naive Bayes (NB), and logistic regression (LR). For implementation, a dataset has been taken from a PIMA database consisting patient’s health record, and these five machine learning techniques are applied to that dataset. A comparison between all the algorithms is presented in this paper.

As technology is advancing, we can add or take out crucial features from a picture without any trail of tampering. Therefore, its authenticity is called into question especially when images have impressive power. Copy-move is a kind of forgery, where portions of a picture are transformed and inserted into the same picture. Copy-move forgery detection is one such research domain that has put forward various methods to find out copy-move forgery. Many techniques based on image processing and machine learning have been put forward to detect the forgery. Since the duplicated parts are from the same image, many of the features will be similar to the rest of the image making it difficult to detect forgery using the latest methods. In this work, we propose to use SIFT keypoint-based forgery detection with clustering for quickly identifying copy-move forgeries in highly textured regions. As the SIFT keypoints are difficult to detect in smooth regions, we propose to use Hu’s invariant-based block-based forgery detection strategy to detect the missing cases. We show that the joint approach outperforms the method reported by Li et al.

This paper proposes a stochastic technique-based firefly algorithm (FA) for PA. This technique customizes a kind of randomization by searching a set of solutions. In contrast, PA requires more combination of approximation to find an optimal solution. The algorithm involves several steps to produce better results. The attractiveness and brightness of the firefly have been used efficiently to solve the approximation problem. While compared to other similar algorithms, FA is independent of velocities which are considered as an advantage for this algorithm. Subsequently, the multi-swarm nature of FA allows finding multiple optimal solutions concurrently. This technique achieves the main goal of PA that is minimum error value with less number of dominant points. The experimental results show that proposed algorithm generates better solutions compared to other algorithms.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Mobile and Network Security', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.

Deep learning-based methods are used in different medical imaging tasks to detect and diagnose diseases. For example, medical imaging is used to diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE), a commonly occurring cardiovascular disease with high mortality and prevalence and a low diagnosis rate. According to medical experts, PE has resulted in many deaths because of missed diagnoses for the medical condition. Another critical aspect of the disease is the possibility of permanent lung damage if left untreated. The use of deep learning methods in medical imaging is attributed to their ability to use learning-based methods to process enormous amounts of data. However, there are some unique challenges in the detection of PE. PE is not specific in its clinical presentation and is easily ignored, making it difficult to diagnose.

A class of these mining activities is conformance (compliance) checking. The goal is to identify the violation of such patterns, i.e., anti-patterns. Several approaches have been proposed to tackle this analysis task. These approaches have been based on different data models and storage technologies of the event log including relational databases, graph databases, and proprietary formats. Graph-based encoding of event logs is a promising direction that turns several process analytic tasks into queries on the underlying graph. Compliance checking is one class of such analysis tasks. In this paper, we argue that encoding log data as graphs alone is not enough to guarantee efficient processing of queries on this data. Efficiency is important due to the interactive nature of compliance checking. Thus, anti-pattern detection would benefit from sub-linear scanning of the data. Moreover, as more data are added, e.g., new batches of logs arrive, the data size should grow sub-linearly to optimize both the space of storage and time for querying. We propose two encoding methods using graph representations, realized in Neo4J & SQL Graph Database, and show the benefits of these encoding on a special class of queries, namely timed ordered anti-patterns. Compared to several baseline encoding, our experiments show up to 5 x speed up in the querying time as well as a 3 x reduction in the graph size.","['Computer Science', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Computer Communication Networks', 'Database Management', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.

As these objects are multivariate and multidimensional in nature, the number of features and dimensions is reduced without losing the quality of data. Next, a method to find anomalies has been proposed with the obtained dataset. The proposed method uses an unsupervised anomaly detection model using Tax–Duin approach for one-class support vector machine (SVM) to classify outliers. The basic assumption of this model includes classifying the first occurrence of any event as anomaly by default.

A WSN’s expense and structural complexity are all quite relatively less. In a WSN, a sensor node (SN) receives the information from the aerosphere or surroundings. Since a SN has a very low-power battery (LPB), it stops working if a battery power is depleted. Due to the widespread network topology, it is impossible to recharge the battery once it has been depleted. An SN that is not functional can cause the routing protocol to fail. A routing protocol, in most cases, allows an efficient routing path between SNs. Data security via the WSN is always a major concern that must be handled. Almost all of the researchers have discussed their ideas for a WSN routing system that is both energy efficient and secure.

We can employ it to inform decision making processes based on ethical considerations, as a measure to ensure redundancy that helps us in avoiding system failure, as well as for verifying that autonomous systems remain trustworthy by testing for unwanted responsibility voids in advance. We follow recent proposals to use probabilities as the basis for responsibility ascription in uncertain environments rather than the deterministic causal views employed in much of the previous formal philosophical literature. Using an axiomatic approach we formally evaluate the qualities of (classes of) proposed responsibility functions. To this end, we decompose the computation of the responsibility a group carries for an outcome into the computation of values that we assign to its members for individual decisions leading to that outcome, paired with an appropriate aggregation function. Next, we discuss a number of intuitively desirable properties for each of these contributing functions. We find an incompatibility between axioms determining upper and lower bounds for the values assigned at the member level. Regarding the aggregation from member-level values to group-level responsibility we are able to axiomatically characterise one promising aggregation function. Finally, we present two maximally axiom compliant group-level responsibility measures – one respecting the lower bound axioms at the member level and one respecting the corresponding upper bound axioms.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

RT-PCR test is the most preferred test for the detection of COVID despite being a time-consuming process. Research has shown that CT scan of lungs can be used to identify COVID infected people in a shorter span of time. The proposed model uses a U-NET-based two staged detection model to segment the abnormal region from the CT scan images. The segmentation module consists of U-Net which produces a binary segmentation mask of regions infected by COVID. The U-Net was trained with dice coefficient loss to improve the structural similarity between ground truth regions and predicted regions. The segmented regions are used to classify COVID contraction. Multiple classification models such as Xception, ResNet, and Inception-ResNet were tested to classify segmented regions. Xception model outperformed other models, produced an accuracy of 98.77%, and thus was chosen as our backbone network.

The first module learns job posting representations from textual content and metadata attributes in an unsupervised way. The second module learns job seeker representations from job application records and metadata attributes. It includes a personalized-attention mechanism that adapts the importance of each job in the learned career preference representation to the profile of a specific job seeker. The third module then models the Next-Application Prediction task as a top- K search process based on the similarity of representations. Text content plays a major role in describing job postings, and how the job content is encoded affects the model performance. Therefore, we explore the utility of different content encoding methods. In addition, geographic location is another essential factor influencing the preferences of job seekers in the recruitment domain. We also explore the influence of geographic location on the model performance from the perspective of negative sampling strategies.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Mathematical Models of Cognitive Processes and Neural Networks']"

Whether it be to listen to your favorite songs or watch a movie, we all end up using either device at some point or the other during our days. Especially with the COVID-19 pandemic that struck us last year, we have all been confined to our homes for the most part. This leads to an increase in the usage of such devices. We have often found ourselves bored and feel like watching a movie or feeling quite blue and end up listening to our all-time favorite songs. It has become an essential part of our daily lives at this point. With the COVID-19 pandemic starting from 2020, there has been a significant rise in the number of people purchasing wearable earphones, headphones, and other audio devices. A study conducted by the International Data Corporation showed a 144.3% YoY growth in available earwear devices in 2020. A study conducted by the team at boAt also shows that their company saw significant growth in terms of their products which were purchased by consumers like us during the pandemic period. Earphones and headphones are available from a plethora of brands and in a wide range of prices depending upon our requirements. Despite all these differences in specific models and brands, one thing that all earphones/headphones have in common is the fact that they are designed to provide a higher level of isolation from our surrounding environment compared to hearing the same media through our basic loudspeakers. Now it is also known that people prefer higher levels of isolation while listening to different media that they are willing to pay a higher price for achieving it, and manufacturers also capitalize on this knowledge. There are special models of earphones with Noise Canceling Technology—which further isolates the user from hearing barely anything going on in their surroundings. There are positives to this aspect—yes, but there are also negatives to this. Suppose a user, listening to audio using Noise Canceling headphones, is being called out to by somebody in their vicinity in the event of an emergency. This particular aspect makes it extremely difficult to alert the user and can even be a threat to their own lives. Our proposed system aims to combat this problem by using a relatively simple technology of voice recognition software combined with preexisting hardware in the user's device.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Statistics, general']"

Despite the potential benefits, identity violation, copyright infringement, illegal re-distribution, and unauthorized access have all been significant. To address all these breaches, in this paper, a reversible medical image watermarking scheme using interpolation is proposed. The medical image is partitioned into Border Region (BR), Region of Interest (ROI), and Region of Non-interest (RONI) regions. BR is used for embedding integrity checksum code generated from ROI for tamper detection. RONI is used for embedding watermark. To ensure complete recovery of ROI and high embedding capacity, ROI is compressed before embedding. To ensure high-security compressed ROI, hospital emblem and EHR merged and then encrypted using a random key generated from Polybius magic square to get higher security. The proposed scheme is proved to take less computational time as there are no complex functions used in the embedding. The experiments performed on the proposed scheme is proved to have high imperceptibility, robustness, embedding capacity, security, and less computational time.

The survival rate decreases if the cancer is not detected at an early stage. Breast ultrasound (BUS) is emerging as a popular modality for breast cancer detection owing to its several advantages over other modalities. We proposed a novel deep learning framework named BUS-Net for automated lesion segmentation in BUS images in this work. However, every deep learning framework has disadvantages of its own; however, the drawbacks associated with individual models can be overcome when combined. Our proposed BUS-Net is an ensemble of three popular deep learning frameworks, namely attention U-net, U-Net and SegNet. The final segmentation map generated by BUS-Net is a pixel-level fusion on the outputs of each of the individual frameworks. The potentiality of BUS-Net was tested on a publicly available dataset named BUSI dataset. This dataset consists of 647 tumor images collected from 600 different female patients. To prevent biased results, the training and test set were separate. BUS-Net framework achieved an accuracy—93.19%, precision—93.18%, recall—88.75%, dice—90.77%, and volume similarity—95.55% for lesion segmentation in the test set. The degree of correlation between the lesion region segmented by the medical experts and that segmented by BUS-Net was high ( $$R^2 = 0.9131$$ R 2 = 0.9131 ). Further, the performance of BUS-Net was also compared with the state-of-the-art techniques. This comparison showed that BUS-Net maintains a tradeoff between precision and recall, proving the robustness, efficiency, and reliability of the framework.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics']"

The sentiment analysis for movie recommendation is the main focus of this study. There are too many reviews and comments for movies to be manually processed. Therefore, to effectively process, we utilized user assessments of movies (whether they were favorable or unfavorable) to construct an overall assessment of the movie, which we then used to suggest it to other users. Even the most sophisticated review algorithms have been baffled by the enormous volume of reviews that are currently available. As a result, a strategy for extracting knowledge from the existing reviews and using it more skillfully needs to be created. This study utilized Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) to perform movie sentiment analysis on a dataset of 50k reviews from IMDB movies. Initially, the data was pre-processed using a GloVe word embedding algorithm. The testing outcomes showed that, with accuracy of 87.11% and an F1-score of 87%, LSTM beats other strategies. However, ANN recorded accuracy of 73.95%, while CNN reported accuracy of 85.17%.

Most textual contents are unstructured and messy forms, which are impractical and cumbersome to organize or manipulate by human experts. Therefore, developing an automatic short text classification model concerning low-resource languages, including Bengali, is critical. Moreover, the crucial barrier to classifying short text in Bengali is the unavailability of text corpora, scarcity of linguistics tools, a limited number of words in the text, and a lack of dependencies between the words. This paper presents a short text classification model using the ensemble of four base deep learning classifiers (Neural Network (NN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU)). Additionally, a corpus of around 0.13 million Bengali texts is developed for short text classification into six categories (e.g., international, national, sports, amusement, technology, and politics).

Basically, cancer can arise in any tissue of the body, and while each variety of cancer has unique characteristics, the fundamental processes that might cause cancer are highly common in all disease types. Breast cancer is one of the most ubiquitous types of cancer in females. In males, prostate cancer is the most dangerous during recent years. This study focuses on breast cancer as well as on prostate cancer in the direction of their early predictions. For early prediction, eight classification models had been used such as logistic regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), decision tree (DT), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). This work includes three different datasets for research analysis of breast and prostate cancer predictions. Two datasets for breast cancer (Coimbra and Wisconsin) and one for prostate cancer are taken from UCI and Kaggle repository, respectively. For improving the results of prediction, the normalization technique and feature selection method had been used in this paper. Performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and curves of each classifier are analyzed in this study. Most of the classifiers did well after using the feature selection method (ANOVA). In the case of Breast Cancer Coimbra, KNN give good results with 80% accuracy in both the cases with or without using feature selection.

Gender-Based Violence (GBV) is also a major issue in social media. As a part of GBV, hate speech against women is on the rise on all social media. There are some lapses available in the stand-alone classifiers in detecting such speech, and the performance of ensemble classifiers is much better. Also, many research works have focused on common hate speech datasets. Hate speech against women has been used in very few research activities. But such hate speech is very dangerous. As a result, this research employs, Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to compute metrics and performances and then use those algorithms to create a voting classifier to develop a more accurate model for detecting hate speech against at women. Two phases were used in this study. RF, LR, DT, and LSTM were used as foundation stand-alone classifiers in the first phase of the ensemble procedure. In Phase Two, the weights of the second-level classifier were estimated using first-level classifiers. Hate speech against women was detected using an open-source #MeToo dataset that was utilized for training and testing by the researchers. The dataset is publicly available on GitHub which was uploaded by Nazmus Sakib. This dataset consists of 278,765 #MeToo movement posts on social media. It clearly shows that the proposed voting classifier model has the highest values in all metrics including accuracy (89%). When we check the strongly positive classification, the proposed model has performed well in precision (0.90), recall (0.91), and F-measures (0.90) and it can calculate strong positive hate speech more efficiently than other stand-alone classifiers. This voting model takes more time to train since it has multiple models inside. By training it for more epochs, we can further increase accuracy.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The paired Totally Looks Like (TLL) image dataset is a good example of visually similar paired images to figure out how humans compare images. In this research, we consider these more generic annotated categories to build a semantic manifold distance. We introduce an atypical triplet-loss using the inverse Kullback-Leibler divergence to model the distribution of the anchor-positive (a-p) distances. In the new redefinition of triplet-loss, the anchor-negative (a-n) loss is conditional to the a-p distance distribution which prevents the loss correction fluctuations in the plain summed triplet-loss function of absolute distances. The proposed atypical triplet-loss builds a manifold from relative distances to a “super” anchor represented by the a-p distribution. The evaluation on the paired images of the TLL dataset showed that the retrieving score from the first candidate guess (top-1) is $$75\%$$ 75 % which is $$\times 2.5$$ × 2.5 higher compared to the recall score of the baseline triplet-loss which is limited to $$29\%$$ 29 % , and with a top-5 pairing score as high as $$78\%$$ 78 % which represents a gain of $$\times 1.4$$ × 1.4 .","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computers and Education', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.

Trustworthiness of AI results require very detailed and careful validation of the applied algorithms, as some errors and biases could reside deeply inside AI components, which might affect inclusiveness, equity, justice and irreversibly influence human lives. It is critical to detect them and to reduce their negative effect on AI users. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to bias detection. Using the Deep Learning (DL) models as examples of a broader scope of AI systems, we make the models self-detective of the underlying defects and biases. Our system looks ‘under the hood’ of AI-model components layer by layer, treating the neurons as similarity estimators – as we claim the main indicator of hidden defects and bias. In this paper, we report on the result of applying our self-detection approach to a Transformer DL model, and its Detection Transformer object detection (DETR) framework, introduced by Facebook AI Research (FAIR) team in 2020. Our approach automatically measures the weights and biases of transformer encoding layers to identify and eventually mitigate the sources of bias.

In sync with these demands, most of the classical commutating models fail, especially due to large unstructured features of gigantically huge volume. To alleviate this problem, feature selection can be a viable solution; provided it guarantees minimum features with optimal accuracy. In this reference, the proposed work contributed a first of its kind solution which could ensure minimum features while ensuring expected higher accuracy to meet 4V demands. To achieve it, in this paper, a robust Chi-Squared Select-K-Best Incremental Feature Selection (CS-SKB-IFS) model is developed that achieved a minimum set of features yielding the expected accuracy. Subsequently, over the selected features, the CS-SKB-IFS model is used for further classification using the Extra Tree classifier. Thus, the strategic amalgamation of the CS-SKB-IFS model achieved the accuracy of (91.02%), F-Measure (91.20%), and AUC (83.06%) than the other state-of-art methods.

In this paper, we propose a symbolic approach to store an optimal policy compactly. We use decision trees for classifying optimal actions that are used to store a compressed representation of an optimal policy. To reduce memory consumption, we propose several approaches that keep the precision of the computed values or provide an approximation of them by considering a threshold for errors in the computed values. The first approach limits the depth of trees to reduce memory consumption. The second one detects and avoids non-important states to have smaller sets of states. The third approach prioritizes states by considering their impact on the precision of results. We use the PRISM case studies to investigate the effectiveness of our approach.

Despite the fact that privacy-related issues are generally considered critical, they do not arouse the same interest as the other reported aspects. For instance, when the carried information contains sensitive data, it should be protected from malicious intent. Nevertheless, most of the protocols used seem to ignore this, assuming others should take charge of the task. The aim of this document is to propose an innovative routing protocol, able to provide privacy preservation with a delivery performance comparable to the current most widely used protocols by taking inspiration from a feature borrowed from human nature, the vocal timbre.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Existing security solutions in this domain are mainly prevention-based and are highly insufficient due to the power consumption and costly resources when implementing computationally expensive solutions. As an alternative, we propose in this paper an anomaly detection system based on principal component analysis to assure the security of networked medical devices. We evaluate our approach with a publicly available dataset collected in a real-time medical cyber-physical system testbed network and the results show the proposed approach successfully detects malicious attacks with a high detection rate and an acceptable low false alarm rate.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

With increasing patient loads at registration counters and limited health infrastructure, minimizing patient waiting time for efficient service delivery is of paramount importance. This is one of the problems of interest and our solution tries to reduce the turnaround time by minimizing the load at registration counters. By effective use of mobile technology and quick response codes we can provide patient for self-registration of their visits and avoid long queues at registration counters and directly visit doctor’s room. This would be beneficial for hospital management to provide better patient care, serve more number of patients, and effectively plan hospital manpower. This paper presents a pilot implementation of this solution in tertiary-level hospitals in India.

In order to minimize this cost (human effort), Vulnerability Prediction Models (VPMs) can be used by software development teams during inspection tasks. The VPM low precision makes its application unfeasible, because it indicates the waste of human effort during the inspection. One of the obstacles in the construction of efficient VPMs ( i.e. , high precision) is modeling meaningful features related to the vulnerabilities, specially in the initial training stages. In this work we compare a promising feature, extracted through another domain ( i.e. , defect prediction) techniques.

The ADLs considered are: (i) preparing and drinking tea, and (ii) preparing and drinking coffee.Abnormal behaviour identified in the context of these activities can be an indicator of a progressive health problem or the occurrence of a hazardous incident. Monitoring ADLs for detecting abnormal behaviour is of particular importance due to the potential life changing consequences that could result from not acting timely. Prior to performing ADLs, the participants were asked six questions related to their well-being and mood. In addition to data collected from accelerometers, data was also collected from contact and thermal sensors, and radar. The work presented is a first step towards a more. personalised approach in which individual user profiles are considered as it is acknowledged that people behave differently from each other. Thus, data was collected seven times for each participant. We have evaluated our approach with accelerometer data collected from 15 participants. The experimental results show that accelerometer data is sufficient to identify the main stages of the ADLs considered, and therefore, any unusual changes in the signals and duration could mean that abnormal behaviour occurred.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Motivated by this, we consider the stochastic NFV networks in this chapter, where the link bandwidth and delay are assumed to be random variables and their cumulative distribution functions are known. We first study how to calculate the delay and bandwidth value in an SFC such that their realizing probabilities are satisfied. Subsequently, we formally define the traffic routing problem in stochastic NFV networks and prove it is NP-hard. We present an exact solution and a tunable heuristic to solve this problem. The proposed heuristic is a sampling-based algorithm, and it leverages the Tunable Accuracy Multiple Constraints Routing Algorithm (TAMCRA) to find a multi-constraint path for each adjacent VNF pair. It dynamically adjusts the link weights as well as delay and bandwidth realizing probability constraint after finding the path for each VNF pair so that the cumulated probabilities will not violate the specified values. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms via extensive simulations.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Graph Theory', 'Operations Research, Management Science', 'Theory of Computation', 'Algorithm Analysis and Problem Complexity']"

In some cases, however, the amount of data is still not sufficiently large (e.g. in some machine learning applications). Data augmentation is a widely used mechanism to increase the available data in such cases. Current augmentation methods are mostly developed for statistical data and only a small part of these methods is directly applicable to graphs. In a recent research project, a novel encoding of pairwise graph matchings is introduced. The basic idea of this encoding, termed matching-graph, is to formalize the stable cores of pairs of patterns by means of graphs. In the present paper, we propose to use these matching-graphs to augment training sets of graphs in order to stabilize the training process of state-of-the-art graph neural networks. In an experimental evaluation on five graph data sets, we show that this novel augmentation technique is able to significantly improve the classification accuracy of three different neural network models.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computers and Education', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.

It has infected about 231 million individuals globally, and approximately 4.7 million have died as a result. Recent findings suggest that X-ray imaging techniques can provide salient information about the COVID-19 virus. Since then, many deep learning models have been developed and open-sourced. During the development of the deep learning models, several hyper-parameters need to be tuned. In this paper, the authors have proposed a method through which the process of hyper-parameter tuning of the deep learning models can be automated using the concept of MLOps. The collection of procedures aimed at maintaining deep learning models in a reliable and efficient manner is termed as MLOps. The proposed approach helped in achieving an improved accuracy of 97.03%, in less time without human interface. This will eliminate the requirement of trained personnel during the model re-training stage as the system has the facility to retrain itself continuously, till the permissible accuracy is achieved.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Statistics, general']"

Traditionally, statisticians only focused on the analysis of small datasets, but now they have to interact with big data. The analysis of big data is complex and requires the collaboration of key stakeholders, such as business managers, IT specialists and statisticians to manage, store, analyze and interpret all the data. The objective of this paper is to re-assess the role of the statistician in this new and unfamiliar territory and to develop a big data life cycle framework to explain the purpose of the statistician in the big data life cycle from a business perspective. Qualitative analyses were conducted with senior managers at Woolworths South Africa and business consultants from South Africa and abroad. A quantitative analysis was performed with 15 senior managers in JSE-listed organizations in the Western Cape of South Africa. The findings from both the quantitative and qualitative information revealed different meanings from an organizational point of view, both in terms of the importance of being data driven and using big data. Based on the results of the study, we see that statisticians play a collaborative role due to the way they link the various phases of the phases of the big data lifecycle together.

One of the applications of ML is biochemistry. Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary science that uses computers and communication science to understand biological data. One of its most difficult tasks is to distinguish between regular genes and disease-causing genes. The classification of gene sequences into existing categories is utilized in genomic research to discover the functions of novel proteins. As a result, it is critical to identify and categorize such genes. We employ ML approaches to distinguish between infected and normal genes using classification methods. AdaBoost has a high degree of precision; relative to the bagging algorithm and Random Forest Algorithm, AdaBoost fully considers the weight of each classifier. To generate a sequence of weak classifiers, an AdaBoost-based learning approach is used to find the most ‘informative’ or ‘discriminating’ features.

The outcomes of an online survey conducted among the parents reported that 70% of the respondents felt that an emotionally intelligent interactive chatbot can be useful for children to cope with intense subject matters related to low grades, no friends, bullies, and others. The study highlights various features of a chatbot like a user interface, personalization, responsiveness, security, and human intervention. From the findings, the author has suggested five design principles along with the detailed architecture of a chatbot framework. The paper will be useful for future studies that seek to design and develop a highly efficient emotionally intelligent chatbot for children which is trusted by their parents.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Currently, there are three major methods for using CNN: starting from scratch, using a pre-trained network off the shelf, and performing unsupervised pre-training with supervised changes. When it comes to those with dietary restrictions, automatic food detection and assessment are critical. In this research, we show how to address detection difficulties by combining three CNNs. The different CNN architectures are then assessed. The amount of parameters in the examined CNN models ranges from 5,000 to 160 million, depending on the number of layers. Second, the various CNNs under consideration are assessed based on dataset sizes and physical image context. The results are assessed in terms of performance vs. training time vs. accuracy. Finally, the accuracy of CNNs is investigated and examined using human knowledge and classification from the human visual system (HVS). Finally, additional categorization techniques, such as bag-of-words, are considered to solve this problem. Based on the findings, it can be concluded that the HVS is more accurate when a data set comprises a wide range of variables. When the dataset is restricted to niche photos, the CNN outperforms the HVS.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

However, machines lack a complex brain like that of a human in order to sense and distinctively recognize different emotions correctly. This ability, if learned by a computer or a mobile device—can have remarkable applications in the real world. The function of instantly responding to changes in user’s preference as well as complementing the user’s mood is a valuable asset for such systems. In recent research, it is proved that listeners experience a clear emotional response and one’s taste in music is immensely driven by their personality moods. Without a doubt, a listener’s response to a music piece is dependent on a variety of factors like age, culture, personal preferences, gender, and context. Nevertheless, this set-aside, we can also classify songs based on our emotions. Facial expressions are a natural way to express and convey one’s emotions. And these emotions, in turn, affect the mood of the person. So, based on an accurate emotional recognition model, recommending music that anyone can relate to, which creates interest in users will be very useful, especially for monitoring patients with mood disorders to provide them with music therapy or mood enhancement and thereby reduce their anxiety/stress levels. Artificial intelligence is a large-scale, leading, and vital domain that has drawn a lot of researchers in the current age. This domain has an extensive take over the world in a very short span of time. We use it in our everyday life in the form of self-driving cars, digital assistants like Amazon Alexa, chatbots, and many more. Developing a system that will recommend music by recognizing the mood of a person based on their facial expressions is the core idea of this project.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Statistics, general']"

In this paper, the generic framework has been proposed for gait activity recognition using the inception-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The gait pattern is a compound of seven sub-phases. However, sequential execution of these seven sub-phases of left and right legs is called gait cycle. Gait features are used to perform the biometric, biomechanics, and human psychology analysis of human beings. Human walking is very challenging to measure due to high variability. It depends on age, gender, walking terrain, walking speed, mental condition, health condition, etc. The analysis of human gait helps identify human activities, diagnose many gait-related diseases like Parkinson’s and freezing of gait. Due to variability of gait, biometric is difficult to spool. This paper covers to analyzing the existing available wireless sensor data mining (WISDM) dataset and our gait dataset of human activity (GDOHA) dataset and evaluating the performance. Moreover, we compare performance metrics on datasets applying machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The result achieved 99.03% accuracy using the inception-based CNN model.

These CNN-architectures are therefore unnecessarily costly to train and deploy. The increase in network-complexity also results in diminishing returns in terms of the predictive quality. The receptive field of a convolutional layer is strictly limiting the features it can process. We can consistently predict unproductive layers that will not contribute qualitatively to the test performance in a given CNN architecture, by analyzing the receptive field expansion over the network. Since the receptive field is a property of the architecture itself, this analysis does not require training the model. We refer to this analysis technique as Receptive Field Analysis (RFA). In this work, we demonstrate that RFA can be used to guide the optimization of CNN architectures by predicting the presence of unproductive layers. We show that RFA allows the deduction of design decisions and simple design strategies that reliably improve the parameter efficiency of the model on the given task. We further demonstrate that these RFA-guided strategies can reliably improve the predictive performance, computational efficiency or strike a balance between the two. Finally, we show that RFA can also be used to define an interval of feasible input resolutions for any modern architecture, in which the model will operate with high efficiency, while being able to extract any pattern from the image. This allows practitioners to pick efficient input resolutions when adapting models for novel tasks.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Mathematical Models of Cognitive Processes and Neural Networks']"

It is primarily defined by impairments in two brain processes: memory and judgment. Dementia is a broad term that encompasses many medical diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease. Symptoms of Dementia include poor memory, limited social skills, and worsening thinking abilities. No doctor can promise whether it can be cured or not, but Medications and Therapies might help improve the condition. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition that kills brain cells, resulting in memory loss and impairment of other brain processes. When someone is afflicted, their intellectual, behavioral, and social abilities deteriorate continuously. Alzheimer's disease is thought to be primarily caused by incorrect protein building in brain cells. Amyloid is a protein that, in this situation, forms plaques surrounding brain cells. On the other hand, Tau is a protein that binds to brain cells and produces tangles. Alzheimer's disease is often diagnosed around the mid-1960s. This paper presents a Random Forest-based model for stage-specific Alzheimer's disease classification. Our suggested network learns from a short dataset and performs better in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. The Methodologies that we have adopted here are fundamental and necessary for study. Feature selection and data cleaning are the essential steps for our model. Reducing Training Time, reducing overfitting, and improving the model's accuracy through various algorithms is the next step for our model. We use Random Forest Algorithm for building our model and get the highest accuracy as 91.6% respectively. We also use Confusion Matrix, which considers many parameters for the model's accuracy. We then plot various graphs to understand better and better visualize our model.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Management']"

KRR replaces the non-linear decoder of an autoencoder (AE) with a linear regressor trained to reconstruct only normal data. Thanks to the linearity, its reconstruction can be written as the weighted sum of the normal training data, which prevents the reconstruction of anomalous data, and these weights help us to verify undesirable properties of the encoder and the training data. This linearity also reveals the desired property of the encoder for KRR to achieve high anomaly detection performance. We propose a training algorithm for the encoder to realize this property and an efficient data cleansing method. Our experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and KDDCup99 datasets showed higher performance and lower computational cost of KRR than a recent reconstruction-based anomaly detection method (MemAE). The weights of the training data revealed that the AE’s encoder reconstructed anomalous data mainly composed of visually similar training data and our training algorithm prevented this problem. Our data cleansing method correctly removed harmful data from the training data and training on this cleaned dataset improved the performance of KRR.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Mathematical Models of Cognitive Processes and Neural Networks']"

In the scenario of 4G/5G and COVID pandemic, the majority of individuals are dependent on the web gateways as their essential intuitive vehicle for their own and expert necessities; accordingly, it has been a fundamental significance for us to consequently perceive the personality traits of the individual on the opposite side of the screen. Mental analysts have tracked down that an interaction of just 100 ms is adequate to shape judgement about any individual.

Intersection crossing is arguably the most challenging problem for cooperative driving, as vehicles need to coordinate their relative movements while avoiding collisions and optimising intersection throughput. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent based approach exploiting computational argumentation to coordinate vehicles at intersections: vehicles approaching an intersection, represented by agents, argue about their right of way, while an arbitration process resolves conflicting arguments (i.e., leading to vehicle collisions) by applying a configurable conflicts resolution policy and suggesting alternative routes to vehicles. Extensive simulation results show that – in most situations – the argumentation-based approach enables increasing the overall throughput at intersections while decreasing vehicles’ delay.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It is a universally accepted process to measure the punctuality of a student. However, there are certain drawbacks to the existing system where a teacher has to physically mark, whether a student is present or not. The main drawbacks of taking physical attendance are time-consuming while marking the attendance and there is a possibility of proxy attendance. The existing systems like fingerprint scanning and RFID are not completely proof worthy and can be easily tampered with. Keeping this view in mind, we implement a face recognition algorithm to mark the attendance of a student. The main aim of the proposed system is to make the process efficient and save time. The proposed system recognizes the student’s face from the images stored in the database and updates it in the attendance sheet automatically. To implement the online attendance system, we use popular algorithms like Haar-Cascade and HOG algorithm which is provided by the face_recognition library. As most of the face recognition algorithms work on 2D frames, they are unable to overcome the problem of spoofing, where the person’s face gets recognized from a photo.

The 5G network can connect a huge number of user equipment or appliances, which transmit different signals that cause high interference in the network. So Interference becomes a major issue in this network. There are various types of interferences in this network like inter-cell and intra-cell interference, inter-symbol interference, co-channel interference, interference from various connected machines, and interference from other connected devices. For resolving this issue, different linear and non-linear equalizers are used. In this work, the performance analysis of a network with massive MIMO system is done by using zero forcing, minimum mean square error (MMSE), and maximum likelihood (ML) equalizer algorithm, where zero forcing and MMSE are linear equalizers while ML being a non-linear equalizer.

This study found out that these gestures were not indistinguishable. Instead, children have a clear preference for each action according to several indicators, which enabled us to establish a ranking of gesture preference for each action. Further research may expand the experiment by including additional gestures and actions.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Iris-based authentication has been a challenging problem especially for noisy and non-ideal iris images, as the images include realistic noise factors. Presence of noise like reflection of light on eye images, i.e. specular reflection, causes problem in iris recognition. It is one of the major pre-processing tasks in iris recognition system. In this paper, two new and efficient approaches have been proposed and compared their robustness with a few existing specular reflection removal techniques, considering the challenging situation of non-ideal iris images. The first approach uses inward interpolation, and the second approach uses bilinear interpolation with extension to remove reflection. These suggested approaches are faster in execution as well as robust enough to remove reflection without disturbing the texture pattern of original iris images.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics']"

However, sufficient training information is often not available for a new project. Therefore, a predictive model should be built using historical data from additional relevant projects, followed by using the model to predict defects in the target project. The performance of this cross-project technique still has to be increased, mainly because of the distribution divergences among the source and target projects and the ambiguity about which source project should be chosen to train the model. This study proposes a Homogeneous Transfer Learning Model for Defect Prediction (HTL-DP), which covers two phases: the conversion of images and the prediction of defects. To improve the overall performance of this system, we use the popular ResNet18 to compare it with several state-of-the-art techniques and five different pre-defined deep models.

In software engineering, structural adaptations of objects can be modeled using contexts and roles. Existing role concepts support autonomous adaptation but provide only limited support for distributed setups. This paper addresses two major issues of distributed adaptive systems. Firstly, the mapping of roles to the actor model, which facilitates the concurrent execution of independent objects and their communication via message passing. Secondly, a concept for coordinating adaptations across multiple distributed nodes, relying on a strong or eventual consistent adaptation of distributed role-based applications. The former approach always ensures a globally consistent state of the system. The latter increases the system’s availability in the case of network congestions or failures of devices during the adaptation process by superseding a rollback of all intermediate changes. We discuss the cases for applying different consistency criteria and show the feasibility of our approach by presenting an empirical case study of a file server application in a prototypical programming language.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

This results in a much newer array of song recommendations based only on the songs which the user likes, and due to NFS, it can be easily recognized by the user with the precision of 16.78%. Analysis of the results reveals that the song recommendations made by the newly proposed system have a significantly lower intersection with songs that users play from general playlists and available music datasets.

There has been a slew of digital payment networks proposed by both corporate and public entities. These platforms are being used by users to make payments, pay bills, and send money. The cost of Internet plans, the availability of low-cost mobile handsets, and technological savvy are just a few of the factors driving this digital revolution. Although private companies’ platforms are preferred by the bulk of people using digital platforms, public players are continually bringing novel ideas to the table, such as UPI. Another new payment platform named e-Rupi has been created and released for users by the Indian government in a similar endeavor. This platform attempts to use a voucher-based system to deliver social programs, health benefits, and a variety of other services. Hence, this paper investigates the detailed functionality of the e-Rupi platform and performs an empirical evaluation and comparative analysis of e-Rupi with other digital payment platforms.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Scheduling Algorithms are a technique for reducing CPU resource deprivation while simultaneously maintaining fairness among the numerous programs that utilize the resources. Round Robin is a preemptive scheduling method that significantly improves response time by restricting each operation to a certain length of time known as the Time Quantum. Various efforts have been made to calculate a time quantum value to optimize these Round Robin algorithm parameters. However, this gain in response time comes at the expense of turnaround and waiting time. In this paper, we compare the conventional Round Robin CPU scheduling algorithm to updated Round Robin algorithms such as DRRHA, as well as our suggested approaches termed MDRRHA and NDRRHA, which seek to reduce process waiting time. The Quantum value for MDRRHA and NDRRHA is derived dynamically using the arithmetic mean and the normal distribution of execution time values of tasks, respectively. The recommended solutions decrease average turnaround time and average waiting time values by up to 13%. In this research, we compare different job scheduling approaches by simulating them in a variety of test situations.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Although ARMD does not lead to complete blindness, the disease can make it difficult for people to perform daily activities such as driving, reading, writing, cooking, etc. The unavailability of any cure for ARMD, necessitates timely actions of detecting the first symptoms of eye conditions as well as following appropriate treatment options to minimize further damage. Some of the current techniques used to detect and monitor ARMD include the Amsler’s Grid, Near Vision Chart, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), etc. which are generally performed on paper in hospitals or clinics. This proposed solution facilitates prediction of age-related macular degeneration in patients using data collected through a Mobile application. The proposed system includes the digitization of paper-based tests as well as a novel approach for prediction of ARMD through Deep Learning.

Evidence of the EMI lecturers’ actual classroom instructions and their pedagogical positions were collected and analyzed. Their instruction was identified as being on the continuum between expository and constructivist teaching, with more leaning towards an expository approach in their teaching. The data disclose that the reasons for this prevalence of expository teaching are based on the lecturers’ rational choice rather than any overall attribution to their educational culture. Perceiving undergraduate education as the foundational stage of tertiary education and their self-assessment of their role as the main knowledge resource contributed to their distinctive pedagogical view and instructional practices in EMI teaching.","['Education', 'Teaching and Teacher Education', 'Language Education', 'Curriculum Studies', 'International and Comparative Education']"

Object detection based on deep learning has shown encouraging results. Since December 2019, deadly virus named CORONA or COVID-19 started to engulf the whole planet with its impact. One of the easiest and simplest ways to protect oneself from this virus is by wearing a mask. In order to detect whether a person is wearing mask or not, we propose a model to detect various face masks that include cloth masks, N-95 masks, medical masks, and no mask. The proposed model consists of two major components—annotating, labeling images and detection of face masks. A new dataset has been created by combining images from Medical Masks Dataset and Google Images, and then these images were annotated according to the mentioned categories. A comparative study has been presented among different object detection algorithms along with a proposed detection algorithm. Results show that YOLOv5 performs best in the detection of face masks when compared to other detection models. It achieved a mAP of 0.51 in just 0.24 h on our dataset. On comparing YOLOv5 to the proposed model, we found that our model achieved a precision of 0.9 as compared to 0.88 of YOLOv5. Among existing approaches YOLOv5 performed the best with precision of 0.88. The model proposed in the work results in precision of 0.90 outperforming all existing models.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

When signing a blockchain transaction, the user must have access to his private key, which must be kept on a hardware or software token. The scientific works analyzed in this paper represent the application of Blockchain technology in payment card system, and in this way the architecture of the system is simplified. The fusion of biometric technology and blockchain technology, which allows a blockchain transaction to be signed without tokens and eliminates the need for a third-party transaction validator, has improved the functionality of current payment card systems. This paper contains three contributions. It is first demonstrated how different biometrically based digital signature models reported in the literature compare, then it is demonstrated how blockchain transactions can be digitally signed using digital signatures made using biometrics, and finally, because biometric digital signature creation methods have not attracted much attention in the scientific public, a detailed comparison of the FIBS (Fuzzy Identity Based Signature) scheme and the Fuzzy signature method was presented as for these two schemes was shown that we can implement them in Blockchain and Payment Card System.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business and Management, general', 'Data Engineering']"

doi:10.1007/978-981-19-4676-9_55,en,Implementation of E2EE Using Python,OriginalPaper,"The need for cyber security is felt now more than ever. In an era of constant mass surveillance, illegal spying and cyber-attacks, it is extremely important to have a secure means of communication which cannot be intercepted. Several new protocols were introduced such as HTTPS to encrypt the connection between the client and the server. This made sure that no third person can read the data being transmitted to and from the client. This model of encryption had one major flaw: the server itself. Every message that was encrypted by the sender was decrypted at the server, encrypted again and sent to the receiver. Thus the server can read all the messages. The users of such chatting services had to trust the owners of the services with their privacy. Even if the owners were not involved in shady data deals, they still had the risk of their servers getting hacked or being pressured by the government to reveal the data of their users. All these issues paved the way for a new type of implementation of encryption known as end-to-end encryption often abbreviated as E2EE. The message to be sent is encrypted by the sender and is sent to the server which relays it to the receiver as it is. Since the keys used to encrypt and decrypt the data are available only to the users, the server cannot read the messages sent through it. This model quickly gained popularity and was implemented by many messaging applications, the most notable being WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, and Wire. In this project, we are going to implement E2EE using Python. For encryption, we intend to use the AES algorithm. AES stands for advanced encryption standard which was introduced in 2001 by the NITS (U.S.A.). It was developed by Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemen in response to the earlier broken algorithm DES. AES is a symmetric key encryption algorithm meaning that the same key is used for encryption as well as decryption of the messages. This algorithm has three key lengths—128,192 and 256 bits, whereas a single block size of 128 bits. The version we are going to implement is 128 bits key size.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']"

These Monte Carlo simulations construct light paths between the camera and light sources within the virtual 3D model to calculate the appearance of objects and provide realistic images. Insufficient sampling of the light path space results in high variance between individual pixels in the image which is visually perceived as noise. To reduce this noise, the number of light path samples must be increased until the noise is no longer visible, but this has the disadvantage of significantly increasing the computation time. Finding the right number of samples needed for human observers to perceive no noise remains an open problem that this paper addresses using a new neural network architecture called Guided-Generative Network (GGN). As it is often difficult to extract features from an image for classification tasks, the GGN attempts to automatically find the desired features for noise detection. This is done through an architecture composed of 3 models that collaborate to characterize the noise present and guide the classification. The results obtained show that the GGN can correctly solve the problem without prior knowledge of the noise while being competitive with existing methods. A visual validation experiment of the images obtained by the model indicates a significant reliability to the requested task.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Mathematical Models of Cognitive Processes and Neural Networks']"

However, the structural, syntactic, and semantic heterogeneity of metamodel, drastically complicates the interconnection of models and thus the digital continuity. A key element of Model-Driven Architecture (MDA), model transformations could be one of the solutions to promote model interoperability. They allow the description of the transformation rules that link the different metamodels concepts. However, significant efforts are needed to describe and maintain model transformations in an ever-changing digital environment. One of the key challenges of the MDA approach is the automation of model transformations. Recent work exploiting machine learning techniques to infer model transformations has shown very promising results. However, learning algorithms, involve too much training data and require a large and varied dataset. In our work, we want to experiment the reinforcement learning techniques to infer transformation rules and to counter the need to provide a considerable volume of data for machine learning.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Computer-Aided Engineering (CAD, CAE) and Design']"

Imbalanced microarray datasets refer to uneven distribution of genomic samples among different contributed classes which can negatively affect the classification performance. Therefore, gene selection from imbalanced microarray dataset can give rise to misleading, and inconsistent nominated genes that would alter the classification performance. Such unsatisfactory classification performance is due to the skewed distribution of the samples across the microarrays toward the majority class. In this paper, we propose a modified version of Emperor Penguin Optimization (EPO) algorithm combined with Random Forest (RF) of Bagging and Boosting Classification named by EPO-RF to select the most informative genes based on classification accuracy using imbalanced microarray datasets. The modified version of EPO was built to be based on decision trees that takes in consideration the criterion of tree splitting weights to handle the imbalanced microarray datasets. Average gene expression binary values are used as a preliminary step for exploring disease trajectories with the aid of metaheuristic optimization feature selection algorithms. Results show that the proposed model revealed its superiority compared to well-known established metaheuristic optimization algorithms, e.g., Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Salp Swarm Optimization (SSO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Genetic Algorithms (GA’s) using several pediatric sepsis microarray datasets for patients who admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for the first 24 h.","['Computer Science', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Computer Communication Networks', 'Database Management', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.

The goal of this study is to statistically analyze non-parametric correlation coefficients for initializing the input-hidden weight matrix of three single hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs).

The idea of DMAPF is to decompose a given MAPF problem into smaller sub-problems, then solve them in parallel. It has been shown that DMAPF can achieve higher scalability compared to centralized methods. This paper addresses two problems in the previous works. First, the previous works only divide problem maps in a simple, rectangular manner. This can create sub-problems with unbalanced numbers of locations in their maps when the shape of the original map is not rectangular or when the obstacles are not uniformly distributed. Having sub-problems that vary in sizes diminishes the effectiveness of parallelism. Second, the idea of DMAPF is to have agents move across sub-problems until they reach the sub-problems that contain their goals, but the previous works do not have a mechanism to regulate the number of agents residing in the sub-problems, thus it may fail to find the solution when a sub-problem is overcrowded. To mitigate the problems, we introduce ( i ) a method to decompose MAPF problems with balanced numbers of vertices; and ( ii ) a mechanism to regulate the number of agents in sub-problems. We also improve the performance of the Answer Set Programming (ASP) encoding, that was used in previous DMAPF implementations to solve MAPF sub-problem instances, by eliminating unnecessary parameters. The results show that the new solver scales better and is more efficient than the previous versions.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Based on the results, the survey proposes the answers to the central questions of public health services development: what is the correlation between the trust of citizens in a national healthcare system, the government's decision, and the effectiveness of lockdown measures taken to stop the coronavirus spreading with reference of Ukraine and India. This research analyses focus on personal and social attitude towards the immediate danger and the ways how different cultural environments react to the new factors of development and risk in general. It proves that personal and social responsibility is directly connected with a level of trust in the national healthcare system and government decisions. Indian and Ukrainian societies before a face of equal danger and experiencing similar personal emotions show the different social behaviour due to the opposite attitude to national healthcare policy and different social and personal evaluations of the government response. The comparison of the answers of Indian and Ukrainian respondents showed a higher level of passive social reaction and obedience in the Indian group and the lower level of obedience and a higher level of active-controlled and uncontrolled reaction in the Ukrainian group.

As the users’ requests are of enormous magnitude, it manifests as overloaded physical machines resulting in quality of service degradation and SLA violations. This challenge can be negotiated by exercising a better virtual machine allocation by dint of re-allocating a subset of active virtual machines at a suitable destined server by virtual machine migration. It is exhibited as improved resource utilization with enhanced energy efficiency along with addressing the challenge of impending server overloading resulting in downgraded services. The aforesaid twin factors of enhanced energy consumption and enhanced resource utilization can be suitably addressed by combining them together as a single objective function by utilizing cost function based best-fit decreasing heuristic. It enhances the potentials for aggressively migrating large capacity applications like image processing, speech recognition, and decision support systems. It facilitates a seamless and transparent live virtual machine migration from one physical server to another along with taking care of cloud environment resources.

Recommender systems provide users an efficient way to sort through and filter massive amounts of data, by considering their preferences or past history. It has become a ubiquitous tool utilized by several e-commerce companies to direct customers toward products or services they are more likely to purchase or use. It benefits the customers as well, as it saves them the time and effort to sift through endless amounts of information. Since recommender systems require data to give recommendations, many of them face the cold start problem, where the recommender systems do not have adequate information to provide relevant recommendations. Ontology-based recommender systems are popular among researcher as they do not rely on past historical data. In this paper, we create an ontology-based recommendation system to provide restaurant recommendations based on user preferences such as location, cuisine, etc. The user will be able to input the desired preferences and the appropriate recommendation, i.e., the restaurant name, will be fetched. The hierarchical relationships between the different concepts are defined by the ontology which we have created.

The emergence of Smart Homes has brought convenience to people’s lives, especially for people who live alone with physical illness. Smart Home users normally have higher expectations for reliability and safety of sensor systems, particularly in light of how complicated and uncertain the living environment is. The present work attempts to propose a data-knowledge integrated solution to analyze, model and evaluate the reliability of sensor systems in a smart home by combining quantitative reliability analysis and probabilistic model checking. Probabilistic model checking techniques use logical reasoning to check quantitative properties (as system requirements) and provide mathematical guarantee for them. More specifically, Smart Home Sensor Systems (SHSS) is described as a Markov Chain, commonly used probabilistic model, which models the system behaviour (e.g., probabilistic choice of state transition), and SHSS reliability properties are defined by Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL). These choices of model and specification formula allow us to use one of the most recently developed open source probabilistic model checkers, PRISM, to perform the model checking of reliability verification task in SHSS. A real world smart home dataset (Van Kasteren dataset) is employed along with PRISM to illustrate the modeling approach and demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed approach.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This study is conducted on two aspects: first on the spike glycoprotein sequences of coronaviruses infecting animals based on association with humans and the second on variants of SARS-CoV-2 based on geographic location of the sequences collected. Coronavirus is considered to be originated in bats and reached humans through unknown sources. We extend this possibility by conducting studies on the spike glycoprotein of coronaviruses that infect animals having some association with humans directly or indirectly as well as to provide better insights into the different mutations that had occurred to the SARS-CoV-2 as it spread through countries.

Before starting an adequate treatment, a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 is a mandatory criterion. For a patient with critical respiratory syndrome, rapid and precise diagnosis is a prime challenge. Different manual methods of clinical diagnosis are in practice. However, these manual techniques suffer from serious drawbacks such as poor sensitivity, false negative results, and high turn-around time. The diagnosis based on the radiographic image (X-ray or computed tomography) of infected lungs is another clinical method for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19. However, it requires an expert radiologist for precise diagnosis. Instead of a prolonged clinical process, an alternative way of rapid diagnosis is the only way of some lifesaving.

However, they suffer from some unavoidable limitations concerned with deep learning.

It creates better human–computer interaction. Emotions are idiosyncratic and difficult to explain by voice, so it is also difficult to predict a person's emotions, but voice emotion recognition makes it possible. This is the same concept that animals such as dogs, elephants, and horses use to understand human emotions. There are various states for predicting one's emotions. They are tone, pitch, expression, action, etc., are considered to find emotions through language. Some samples are used to make the classifier to train and perform speech emotion recognition.

This issue was addressed by Devidas et al. [ 12 ] with a static decentralized group signature scheme(DGSS) by decentralizing the group manager. However, the limitation of DGSS is that it works only for static domains, where group members are fixed and will not allow new members to join and existing members to leave the network. In this paper, DGSS is extended to propose a dynamic decentralized group signature scheme which allows the group members to join and revoke at run-time. The performance of Devidas et al. [ 12 ] scheme is also improved by reducing the number of multiplications to make it suitable for user identity privacy protection in lightweight blockchains or memory constraint devices. The security analysis and proof of correctness for the proposed scheme are also discussed in this paper.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

While direct resizing may alter the texture of an image, appropriate padding is not straightforward. In this paper, possible resizing and/or padding scenarios have been empirically studied to have more insights into preprocessing in image classification experiments. It is found that appropriate padding while maintaining the aspect ratio appears to be reasonably prospective than direct resizing. Specifically, padding with estimated background appears to be well-performing in experiments where textures are significant. In all the experiments carried out, resizing with some kind of padding is found to yield the highest classification accuracy.

The bone age assessment (BAA) method is use to identify endocrinological as well as growth abnormalities by contrasting the patient's bone age and actual age. A number of approaches for determining skeletal maturity have been devised; however, the two most significant approaches that employ left hand and wrist radiographs are the Tanner-Whitehouse and Greulich-Pyle methods as mentioned in. While these approaches are well known, they are exceedingly time-consuming and need a skilled radiologist who would have to assess the bone age using a hand atlas as a guideline every time. In our paper, we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to successfully predict the maturity of bone age from hand X-ray images of patients aged 4–17 years old. The examination effort of radiologists, for example, is a restriction of manual clinical processes. Since the manual methods are subjected to observer variability, developing computer-aided and automated systems for bone age evaluation is advantageous.

This calls for the need for a rapid and effective method for quality assessment of tea. The present practice of quality evaluation involves human tasters who assign scores to tea samples based on taste, smell and visual appearances. Hence, these scores are subjective of human biases, non-repeatability and error-prone. Attempts for alternate evaluation techniques were made to evolve an efficient and objective technique for quality assessment of tea using the biomimetic measurement system such as electronic nose, electronic tongue and electronic vision in the last few years. In this study, we have developed a portable Electronic Tongue (e-Tongue) for the characterisation of tea.

We have trained the e-Tongue device with various statistical and neural network-based classification algorithms. Back Propagation-Multi Layer Perceptron, Accuracies obtained employing Probabilistic Neural Network, and Multiple Discriminant Analysis are 90%, 92% and 96%, respectively.

However, there are situations when a single number is not sufficient: e.g., a situation when we know nothing and a situation in which we have a lot of arguments for a given statement and an equal number of arguments against it are both described by the same number 0.5. Several techniques have been proposed to distinguish between such situations. The most widely used are interval-valued techniques, where we allow the expert to describe his/her degree of certainty by a subinterval of the interval [0, 1]. Eliciting an interval-valued degree is straightforward. On the other hand, in many practical applications, another technique has been useful: complex-valued fuzzy degrees. Unfortunately, in the complex-valued case, there is no direct way to elicit such degrees.

When it comes to establishing access control mechanisms in a cross-domain virtual organization-based cloud environment, the situation becomes more cumbersome due to the lack of proper standardized solutions. In this paper, an approach is being defined which combines role-based access control policy with the establishment of trust among the various nodes of different domains which are a part of the cloud environment. Several parameters are considered to calculate the trust values of different entities based on the concept of a collection of feedback from neighbor nodes. A statistical mechanism is also introduced to prevent any biased feedback. If the total trust value exceeds some pre-defined threshold, then only it is considered for the transaction; otherwise, it is not considered. The resource provider as well as the initiator can gather the feedback, and the trust is calculated from both ends in this model.

One of the challenges for quality control is to ensure the uniformity of density distribution. However, current areal density maps obtained from a beta transmission equipment are insufficient to identify variation and defects at the required level. As areal density maps can be interpreted as images, image super-resolution convolutional neural networks (CNNs) promise to reconstruct high-resolution areal density maps with fine texture details. However, for this promise to be realized two challenges need to be overcome. First, generating areal density maps is expensive, and only limited training data is available. Second, current 2D CNNs cannot provide sufficient accuracy in depth. Therefore, we propose a 3-layer voxel representation to adapt 2D CNNs to the particular application of Miralon sheets. Moreover, we also study the transform domains to provide more distinguishable features for density distribution patterns.

In this process, the system is scanned by the intrusion detection system which is a device or software for detecting or identifying the malicious activity. Security mechanisms are required for the substantial growth in the number of applications in order to maintain their protection. There are different types of intrusion detection methods like anomaly based and signature based, but most trending subject to the researchers is machine learning (ML)-based methods. Accuracy is the most influenced parameter for intrusion detection performance. False alarm reduction and detection rate increment or detecting time decrement can be achieved with improvement in the intrusion detection system accuracy. A network intrusion detection using ML for virtualized data is proposed in this paper. Better accuracy is simultaneously increasing the performance. Intrusion detection system main work is huge network traffic data analysis. The classification problems can be solved by machine learning techniques such as Naïve Bayes, random tree, and support vector machine (SVM). NSL-KDD (knowledge discovery dataset) is used for evaluation of proposed intrusion detection system.

doi:10.1007/978-981-19-0105-8_3,en,An Irrigation Support System Using Regressor Assembly,OriginalPaper,"In India, the agriculture sector uses about 84% of the total available water for irrigation. Most of the irrigation is surface-based, and nearly 40% of the irrigation water is wasted due to the unscientific practices adopted by the rural farmers to estimate the actual water demand of their crops. This practice leads to groundwater scarcity and high production costs of the crops. For precise irrigation, the estimation of water needed by a crop is the most significant factor. For proper estimation of irrigation water, the Food and Agriculture Organization recommends the Penman–Monteith method as the most scientific one. However, this method is very complex, involving several region-specific and climatic parameters. It is practically impossible for rural farmers to estimate the daily need for irrigation water using the Penman–Monteith method. As a practical alternative, an automated system is most desirable for rural farmers. This paper presents an irrigation support system to estimate the irrigation water required for a crop correctly. The system has been designed using an assembly of multiple regressors to get the best possible outcome. The outperformed regressor(s) is selected based on the performance evaluated using five standard metrics. This system will benefit rural farmers to estimate the exact quantity of irrigation water needed for a crop. The proposed system is an effective solution to encounter groundwater scarcity and lower the production cost of the crops.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics']"

In the context of learning, it is the task of associating each question with its corresponding skill. Bloom’s Taxonomy is a widely accepted set of hierarchical models used to classify educational content into different levels of complexity and has been used as a guideline in designing questions of various cognitive levels. The cognitive domain list has been the primary focus of most traditional education and is frequently used to structure curriculum and assessments. Knowledge, remember, and apply are the most common classes used for classifying questions. This paper compares different approaches that encode questions into embeddings and classify them using several deep learning models. The feature extraction techniques used include combinations of TF-IDF, POS, and GloVe. The classification models include seven deep learning approaches—K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, and XGBoost classifiers. These models were then evaluated with three different feature extraction approaches to infer the best combination.

The main reason is that it provides the best linear unbiased predictor and it is an exact interpolator when normality is assumed. The robustness of this method allows small departures from normality, however, many meteorological, pollutant and environmental variables have extremely asymmetrical distributions and Kriging cannot be used. Machine learning techniques such as neural networks, random forest, and k -nearest neighbor can be used instead, because they do not require specific distributional assumptions. The drawback is that they do not take account of the spatial dependence, and for an optimal performance in spatial random fields more complex machine learning techniques could be considered. These techniques also require a relatively large amount of training data and they are computationally challenging to implement. For a reduced number of observations, we illustrate the performance of the aforementioned procedures using daily rainfall data of manual meteorological gauge stations in Navarre, where the only auxiliary variables available are the spatial coordinates and the altitude. The quality of the predictions is carefully checked through three versions of the relative root mean squared error (RRMSE). The conclusion is that when we cannot use Kriging, random forest and neural networks outperform k -nearest neighbor technique, and provide reliable predictions of rainfall daily data with scarce auxiliary information.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Data Engineering', 'Statistics for Engineering, Physics, Computer Science, Chemistry and Earth Sciences', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Mathematical Applications in Computer Science']"

The major clinical symptoms linked with this disease are fever, cough, headache, migraine, and breathlessness. Despite tremendous research going on, knowing the way of transmission and its early detection remains a mystery. There is no treatment as of now for this virus, so a lot of unprecedented containment and mitigation policies such as closure of business places, schools, and colleges, marriage gathering restrictions, transport restrictions, and social distancing are being employed. These policies are able to limit the transmission of covid-19, but are not always feasible. Steps must be taken to slow down the spread of this virus and make an early diagnosis of infection to save lives. This paper gives a clear idea about the introduction of Covid-19, its symptoms, post covid-19 symptoms, challenges posed by the virus, and proposed solutions for its early detection to slow down its rate of transmission. Methods : The proposed solution includes a clustering algorithm for massive contact tracing that helps to slow down the transmission rate, and automatic virus detection and classification network known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based upon deep domain transfer learning. Results : The pre-trained model VGG-19 is used and the hyperparameters of the model are tuned as per classification requirement by exploiting the concept of deep domain transfer learning. The model is implemented on publicly available chest radiography images and the system classifies the dataset as covid and non-covid images. The CNN achieves $$97.35\%$$ 97.35 % accuracy outperforming all the existing methods. A new concept of employing nanocoating and nano sprays is also introduced in the paper. Conclusion : To discuss various critical challenges posed by Covid-19. Addressing those issues and proposing various solutions. Proposing clustering machine learning algorithm for massive contact tracing. Developing automatic covid-19 detection and classification system based upon automatic feature detection. Providing solutions based upon nanotechnology to slow down transmission.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Manual identification of diabetic retinopathy is a time-consuming process, and regular screening is a must for an early diagnosis. This paper presented a novel blood vessel parameter extraction method for DR identification using image processing and data mining techniques. An automatic DR diagnosis through image processing techniques, by extraction of blood vessel parameters such as vessel density, minimum and maximum thickness of blood vessels and classification through data mining techniques was proposed. Mostly diabetic retinopathy identification was done by lesion pattern identification such as exudates, microaneurysms, cotton wool spots, etc. However, this work concentrated on calculating the disease parameter through segmented blood vessel region from full fundus image, optic nerve head region and Inferior, Superior, Nasal and Temporal (ISNT) region.

To address this issue, we propose a multipopulation differential evolution with an automatic re-diversification mechanism that consists of combining our previously proposed approach (AMPEDE) with a detection/re-diversification process. In the proposed AD-AMPEDE, the objective function values’ mean and the coefficient of variance are used to detect whether the population has been stagnant or has converged to probably a local optimum. After confirming the existence of stagnation and premature convergence, a re-diversification mechanism, with the strategy proposed for AEPD [ 4 ], is applied on the population. A set of 24 Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB2009) functions is used to evaluate the AD-AMPEDE efficiency. Results display that AD-AMPEDE is very competitive and provides an excellent performance in dealing with some categories of optimization problems.","['Engineering', 'Complexity', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control and Systems Theory']"

In order to avoid a software crash or failure, software developers add assertions to their code in locations where mistakes are likely to occur. All software, even asserted software, must be updated and maintained over time. Assertions may need to be changed as well, depending on the type of change made to the upgraded program. New claims can be made in the software's upgraded version, but old claims can be kept. During regression testing of systems that utilize assertions that leverage fuzzy logic, a new approach for prioritizing test cases is described in this work for the first time. Prioritizing test cases based on fault severity, fault detection, and assessment time are the primary goals of this method. The effectiveness of a particular test case in breaching an assertion is evaluated using fuzzy logic techniques based on the history of the test cases based on the above-mentioned criteria in previous testing operations to generate the proposed solution.

Logic reasoners are designed to perform inferences, that is, to decide whether a formula is a logical consequence of the knowledge base, which is stronger than that and can be intractable in some cases. In addition, under the open-world assumption, it may turn out impossible to infer a formula or its negation. In many practical situations, however, when an agent has to make a decision, it is acceptable to resort to heuristic methods to determine the probable veracity or falsehood of a formula, even in the absence of a guarantee of correctness, to avoid blocking the decision-making process and move forward. This is why we propose a method to train a classification model based on available knowledge in order to be able of accurately guessing whether an arbitrary, unseen formula is true or false. Our method exploits a kernel representation of logical formulas based on a model-theoretic measure of semantic similarity. The results of experiments show that the proposed method is highly effective and accurate.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In the last few years, to accurately identify web robots, machine learning classification methods were used. However, it was discovered that the multiclass distribution in the web robot detection system is substantially skewed due to the data set's class imbalance, which causes problems with classification accuracy. The research presented in this paper examines not only the role of feature selection in improving classification accuracy but also addresses the issue of class imbalance using under-sampling of major classes and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) of minor classes. After that, the classification performance is compared across a number of different classifier types. The results of this study show that oversampling (SMOTE) is more effective than under-sampling at discovering minor classes when employed with the class imbalance data set. Additionally, it was discovered that KNN and XGBoost are more accurately classified than other classifiers throughout this research. However, no single method can be utilized to classify multiclass data.

For the transmission of medical images, digital watermarking schemes are mostly used to ensure that the image has not gone through any unauthorized or illegal modifications during the transmission. Since conventional watermarking schemes alter the pixels in the original image, it is not suited for watermarking medical images. In medical images, permanent modifications may adversely affect the diagnosis process at the receiver side, caused by watermarking, especially when we are using some computer-aided diagnosis tools. This motivated computer scientists to work on reversible watermarking schemes. The reversible watermarking technology makes it possible to recover the required medical image from the watermarked image, while extracting the hidden watermark. So, the reversible watermarking technique does not affect the diagnosis in any way since the recovered image will be equivalent to the original image. This recovered image will be used by the user. The use of reversible watermarking techniques to send patient reports along with medical images is also explored, with the patient reports being embedded in the medical picture itself rather than the watermark. These techniques are commonly known as reversible data hiding techniques. This book chapter gives a brief overview of reversible data hiding techniques, reversible watermarking methods, and the major applications in medical image transmissions. In addition, the chapter addresses contemporary reversible data hiding and reversible watermarking algorithms intended specifically for medical picture transmission. The chapter also discusses some of the obstacles that must be overcome when developing a reversible watermarking system for healthcare applications.","['Computer Science', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It is still a challenging task in artificial intelligence and human–computer interaction due to its high intra-class variation. Facial emotion analysis achieved more appreciation in academic and commercial potential challenges mainly in the field of behaviour prediction and recommendation systems. This paper proposes a novel scattering approach for recognizing facial dynamics using image sequences. Initially, we extract the temporal information from the facial frame by applying a saliency map and hyper-complex Fourier transform (HFT). Later the extracted high-level features are fed to the scattering transform method and machine learning algorithms to classify the seven emotions from the MUG dataset. The performance of proposed wavelet scattering network was evaluated on four different machine learning algorithms and achieved a high rate of recognition accuracy in all classes. In the experimental results, K-NN exhibits the proposed architecture’s effectiveness with an accuracy rate of 97% for the MUG dataset, 95.7% for SVM, 93.7% for decision tree and 91.2% naive Bayes, respectively.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Statistics, general', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

POS tagging is required as a preprocessing task in many types of linguistic research such as named entity recognition (NER), word sense disambiguation, information extraction, natural language translation, and sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose a practical Bengali POS tagger, which takes as input a text written in Bengali and gives a POS tagged output. In recent times, Bi-LSTM networks have been proven effective in sequential data processing but not very much tested on resource-poor and inflectional languages like Bengali. This paper addresses the issues of the POS tagging task for the Bengali language using Bi-LSTM with transfer learning by applying pre-trained word embedding information. The POS tagged output from our proposed model can be used directly for other applications of Bengali language processing as our proposed tagger can also handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.

Sequential rule mining is a pattern mining technique that retrieves rules in order. It has number of applications in different area including healthcare. Healthcare is the prime concern for human’s life. Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), which is also known as type-1 diabetes is a kind of chronic disease and patients of these disease needs to get insulin as a supplement or medicine. Technologies that predict the right amount of insulin dose for a patient is needed for correct prognosis of patients. It facilitates to better health in patients to maintain the glucose level in a specific range which produces the right energy for human cells. Our objective is to find insulin therapy plan for diabetes patients. In this work, we applied some sequential mining algorithms to predict the dosage values of regular, NPH and ultraLente insulin at three different time frames, i.e., at prebreakfast, prelunch, and presupper. Sequential rules are generated to predict the dosage ranges for different time frames with support and confidence metrics. These rules are used to recommend particular type of insulin with dosage amounts. This work also compares different sequential rule mining algorithms such as ERMiner, CMRules, CMDeo, and RuleGrowth with their memory taken and execution speeds. We concluded that by making sequences of blood glucose ranges with insulin dose ranges we can generate rules for insulin prediction as well as diabetes predictions. We can also conclude that after applying different sequential rule mining algorithms, ERMiner is faster among the algorithms but it takes more memory to execute.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

The abundance of opinionated text on the internet contains suggestions made by users that can be used to improve products. These suggestions are important to multiple stakeholders; as product improvements for businesses or as tips and advice to consumers. Until now, the extraction of suggestions has usually been defined as a problem of classifying sentences into suggestion and non-suggestion classes. No work has attempted to differentiate suggestions on the basis of intended receiver. Extracting these suggestions with respect to the aspects that reviewers are not satisfied with could be used as a potential solution to improve products. To address these shortcomings, this study proposes a novel task decomposition called Aspect-Oriented Suggestion Extraction to identify product improvements. It contains three main subtasks: suggestion classification, beneficiary classification and aspect extraction. The proposed approach proved to be very effective in determining suggestions from non-suggestions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on suggestion mining across the domains of hotel, electronics, travel and software achieving F-scores of 91%, 76%, 75% and 85%, respectively. Experimental results of extracting aspect-oriented suggestions from hotel reviews show the effectiveness of the techniques.

In this paper, we consider a novel setting where individuals walk to a common pick-up point and ride together to a single drop-off point from where they walk to their final destination. This setting requires finding the optimal composition of riders and pick-up and drop-off meeting points, as well as an equitable distribution of the costs whereby riders are incentivised to participate. Based on game-theoretic principles, we propose a methodology to determine the optimal pick-up and drop-off points, together with a cost allocation method that is equitable in the sense that it ensures proportionality for sharing the costs, i.e., those who walk more should pay less. We present a formal evaluation of our cost allocation method and empirical evaluation against the Shapley value using real-world and simulated data.

It is frequently difficult for family members, providers, around an ASD patient to interact and communicate with them, necessitating professional assistance. A problem has arisen regarding the lack of automated systems designed especially for people with ASD as well as a lack of experience for neuro-typical people and engaging with these individuals. Existing solutions are restricted, rarely address ASD communities, and use cases. Therefore, we propose and validate an intelligent system called Tantrum-Track to assist in maintaining contact and improving communication with people with ASD and facilitating their integration into their environments and society. This approach can monitor desired outcomes and help in the decision-making process e.g. the system makes a decision about how to handle a certain scenario. For that purpose, we fully detail a comprehensive recommendation system to support people with ASD and support their communication with those in their environment (design phase). This recommendation system model makes two contributions: (1) modelling the autistic person’s context, and (2) representing this context as an ontological knowledge organization system. After assessing the (dis)similarities between two gathered settings, we incorporate these data into our recommendation system. This system suggests actions that are likely to help and calm the autistic person and control a situation before it escalates, and/or prevent a potential tantrum from occurring.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Collision detection applications are presented in Sect.  6.1 , namely collision reflexes and collision location determination in Sect.  6.1.1 , and tactile mapping as part of an autonomy stack of a flying robot in Sect.  6.1.3 . In Sect.  6.2 , the goals and research question posed in this book are extrapolated towards the goal of interaction, disturbance and fault-aware flying robot swarms. It is argued that robust operation of interacting flying robots requires systematic handling of interactions and external inputs from individual robot to swarm level. For this, a scalable methodology for interaction, disturbance and fault handling is introduced, resulting in an awareness pipeline scheme that can be applied to robot swarms. Another algorithmic key element for unification is the extension of well established methods from operational space and multipriority robot control to this system class, potentially leading to novel controls and skills of flying robot swarms.","['Engineering', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Robotics']"

Nowadays, recommender systems are suffering from various problems such as data sparsity, cold start, scalability, synonymy, gray sheep, and data imbalance. One of the major problems to be considered for better recommendation is data sparsity. Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) is one way to address data sparsity problems, cold start issues, etc. In the most traditional system, cross-domain analysis is used to understand the feedback matrices by transferring hidden information and imposing dependencies across the domains.

Malaria is a part of the plasmodium group caused by single-celled microorganisms. This study proposes the use of ensemble model using the three regression algorithms that are linear regression, support vector machine (SVM), and auto-Arima techniques and comparing their results. Predictions of plasmodium virus cases are made with the use of linear regression, support vector machine, and auto-Arima algorithms. The accuracy of prediction is measured by calculating the explained variance score, mean squared error rate, and root mean squared error rate. Our aim is to get better prediction results compared to the individual algorithms by combining the results of these individual models. The proposed work determines the accuracy of linear regression, support vector machine, and auto-Arima and ensembles together to find the trend of prediction using simple Average. A comparison of performance among the three regression techniques indicated the SVM model performs the best and has small RMSE and MAE values. But, by introducing the technique of ensemble modeling using simple average, combining the prediction of these three algorithms results in the lowest RMSE and MAE values.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

BCI technology will surely rely on improved signal capture and clear validation of actual research and delivery models in the future, which will be connected to the dependability issue. For the BCI system to work better, an appropriate signal processing approach must be used that makes it easier to collect physiological data and a higher classifier suitable for the specificity of the system. We offer a concise overview of several signal processing strategies for improving BCI focus. A supervised classification method is utilized to improve the support vector machine in order to recognize and categorize EEG data. The EEG data’s temporal domain properties are retrieved and input as feature vectors into the SVM, which are subsequently utilized for classification and identification. The algorithm’s exploration capabilities and convergence time have both improved, as shown by statistical analysis of the data. The SVM parameters are then optimized using this information. The approaches for feature extraction and classification are covered in this study. This outcome represents a 2–5% improvement over the previous technique. EEG (Electroencephalography) is a complex bio-electrical signal. Researchers may uncover useful physiological information if they do a thorough examination of this data.

To extract characteristics from text-based pictures, morphological component analysis is utilised. Each of these traits has a distinct morphological component. Without losing visual quality, the morphological component technique lowers duplicative but also uncorrelated characteristics, as well as the size in bytes of a text-based picture. The capacity to obtain full text-based picture texture characteristics, rather than relying on a single spatial texture feature, is considered to be a significant aspect of the proposed approach. Before being transferred over Internet of Things-based networks, the morphological portions of a concealed text-based picture have been further divided and generally implanted interested in the least significant pieces of the cover pixels using spatial steganography. To retrieve the message from stored-images, the hidden key of an embedding algorithm can be exchanged with a text recovery approach on the recipient's side.

Privacy is essential where information to be transmitted to the desired target without being intercepted by third parties or bringing them in a way that they cannot understand. Lossless text encryption technique for gray scale or RGB images using least significant bit (LSB) is the most commonly used method to hide data. LSB technique is preferred as it is difficult to draw a distinction between the cover object and stego object if few LSB bits of the cover object are replaced. However, image distortion is a major issue which needs critical investigation as it can change the original image. This paper proposes an algorithm to embed text in RGB images and also evaluate the distortion in image at various bit positions.

Even though in Ukraine this business does not make a major contribution to GDP, the presence of development potential, deferred demand, and performed functions makes it an important component of Ukraine, Therefore, there is a need to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the activities of hospitality entities and justify measures to restore it. The comparison of the main indicators of the functioning of the tourism and hotel business of Ukraine before and during the pandemic period demonstrates significant reductions. However, some businesses and destinations, due to the rapid response to the new reality and the reorientation to domestic tourism, on the contrary, improved pre-epidemic indicators. The unpredictability and scale of the pandemics revealed structural problems in the sector and the need for coordinated activities to address them. The review of measures accepted by the state authorities of Ukraine to minimize the effects of COVID-19 on the tourism and hotel business by 2020 revealed their fragmentation and inconsistency. For the macroeconomic level, there offered a set of institutional and state-legal measures, and there is a partnership of stakeholders at the theme level and the micro level—the systematic operation of various innovative and digital technologies (management, sanitation, technology, and communication). The partnership activities of stakeholders contribute to the innovative recovery of this field, a special place among which is the state and legal support of tourism and business: the introduction of compensation programs for owners and employees, off tax bills, reduction of individual taxes, exemption from liability and/or enforcement contractual relations due to force majeure, and the introduction of state insurance programs to protect against the risks of pandemics.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

A Use Case,OriginalPaper,"The aim of this work is the development of an information system that, by integrating data from different sources and applying semantic technologies, makes it possible to publish and share with society information about the scientific production generated in the university environment. This promotes the dissemination of research results, as well as, from a more ethical point of view, contributing to the transparency of the institution and to the knowledge society. The objective is achieved by implementing a CRIS (Current Research Information System) in a university environment. The main purpose of a CRIS system is to give visibility to the university’s research work, making public the information about its scientific production (publications, projects, theses, …), and those who produce it, the researchers and their research groups. The CRIS system proposal presented is innovative and disruptive due to its advanced features, which means that its performance goes beyond that of a traditional CRIS. Specifically, CRIS represents a case study or application on the one hand of semantic technologies, which allows querying through a SPARQL endpoint, as well as reusing shared data by exporting them in different formats. On the other hand, CRIS also contributes to the development of an institutional data repository by allowing data from different sources to be integrated into a single system.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Unfortunately, current methods require too much user involvement and fail to capture their true preferences. In fact, to avoid the nuisance of manually setting preferences, users usually accept the default settings even if these do not conform to their true preferences. Norms can be useful to regulate behaviour and ensure it adheres to user preferences but, while the literature has thoroughly studied norms, most proposals take a formal perspective. Indeed, while there has been some research on constructing norms to capture a user’s privacy preferences, these methods rely on domain knowledge which, in the case of AI technologies, is difficult to obtain and maintain. We argue that a new perspective is required when constructing norms, which is to exploit the large amount of preference information readily available from whole systems of users. Inspired by recommender systems, we believe that collaborative filtering can offer a suitable approach to identifying a user’s norm preferences without excessive user involvement.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Personal firearms availability inciting civil violence, poaching which has been a major contributor to the ever-increasing number of animal species facing threat of extinction are a few areas demanding immediate attention. Different infrastructure-based solutions like video surveillance and infrared thermography have been proposed to monitor and investigate any illicit activity, but these are not cost-effective, especially in large dense areas with compact viewing angles. We propose a model for acoustic-based approach to detect gunshot and further classify it based on its type/caliber. The proposed solution uses a deep learning convolutional-GRU based model to detect a gunshot in an audio stream and classify it based on type/caliber. Gunshot data used contains 830 instances of eight different types of guns which are overlapped on noisy background to create genuine instances. The audio, either real-time or pre-record, after computing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), is converted into 2D images that are fed to the model. In case the model recognizes any gunshot, the timestamp of the gunshot and weapon caliber is returned, alerting the concerned authorities.

The coronavirus infection was initially discovered in the Chinese town of Wuhan in Dec. 2019 and quickly spread around the world as a worldwide pandemic. Early detection of positive cases and prompt treatment of infected individuals is required to prevent viral transmission. The necessity of testing kits for COVID-19 has grown, and most of the growing nations are encountering a scarcity of testing kits as new cases emerge daily. In this case, the current study is with the help of radiology imaging techniques, including X-ray, to help in detecting COVID-19. In several disease diagnoses and decision-making circumstances, the information provided in a chest X-ray sample is sufficient to assist medical experts. With the help of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the research proposes an intelligent method to classify various nine diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019, with the help of X-ray instances applying pre-trained DenseNet169 architecture. The fundamental goal of this paper is to classify lung diseases with COVID-19. The used datasets are collected from online repositories, i.e., Kaggle and NIH contained X-ray images of all nine classes. This dataset consists of 1200 images for each class. Various rotations and scaling operations have been applied to the dataset, and the data in the dataset are divided into the test, train, and validation sets. In comparison to other studies in the literature, our models performed well. The highest accuracy attained by DenseNet169 is for COVID-19 with an accuracy of 99.4%, F1-score of 97.5%, precision of 97%, recall of 98%, and specificity of 99.6%. The highest True Positive rate we got in this is 99% for COVID-19, followed by 97% for Cardiomegaly. The minimal rate we got is 88% in Atelectasis. DesnseNet169 proved to be more robust and reliable in classifying nine classes, including COVID-19, after adopting a testing strategy proposed in the literature, making them suitable methods for classification using chest X-ray samples.

ResNet50 and masked RCNN (Detectron2 implementation) to predict jaundice from the image of jaundice affected eyes. Our dataset consists of 98 images of jaundice affected eyes and 50 images of normal eyes. The Mask-RCNN model can segment and classify jaundice affected eyes images accurately.

Color Petri Nets are used to model a dynamic scenario where conditions, i.e. obstacles, change at real time, while machine learning is used for obstacle detection.

The diseases related to the heart can bring your life to a halt. The increased cholesterol level in the body and chest pain can be an indicator of bad heart health. Heart attack is a major cause of casualty in today’s time. The unhealthy lifestyle along with the work culture which involves sitting on the desk for a long time has induced heart-related risk in human beings. The early prediction of heart diseases, the situation where a person may suffer from heart attack, can be helpful in saving lives. Modern technologies such as data analysis using data mining can help in early detection and diagnosis of heart-related diseases avoiding heart attacks. In this work, we propose a comparative feature selection followed by classification method to analyze heart attack dataset to predict whether that a person can suffer from heart attack or not. The “orange”—data mining tool has been used for this study. The machine learning models such as decision tree, support vector machine, and KNN have been used for analysis. The proposed method also determines the key features that are effective in predicting a patient with heart disease. The analysis of the result shows highest prediction accuracy: 85% support vector machine by considering top-ranked attributes including chest pain, thal rate, number of maximum heart rate achieved, and exercise-induced angina into consideration.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

Hence, water that is used for agriculture, marine culture, human consumption, etc., should be in good condition to minimize the hazardous effect of water pollution on human health. Rapid unsustainable industrialization, improper huge waste disposal, excess amount fertilizer usage, etc., are responsible for the rapid deterioration of the water quality in rivers and other freshwater bodies. Manual continuous water quality measurement is risky, expensive, and time-consuming. Hence, it is essential to forecast the water quality using statistical time series models. In this paper, three widely used statistical multivariate techniques such as Vector Moving Average (VMA), Vector Auto Regression (VAR), and Vector Auto Regression Moving Average (VARMA), are investigated to forecast water quality parameters like Fecal Coliform (FC), Total Coliform (TC), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), and the associated Water Quality Index (WQI) of the Ganga River. Most of the previous methods worked on forecasting the future values based on past values of individual parameters without considering the interdependency among the water quality parameters. Here, correlation among each parameter is estimated. Subsequently, the future values of a parameter are estimated based on its previous values and the previous values of its correlated parameters. The proposed research work can help properly manage the water quality of the river Ganga by utilizing the forecasted results for the planning of the pollution control strategies. Finally, it helps improve the quality of human beings by minimizing the health issues caused by water pollution.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

Still, modern generative models usually analyze image at the scene level. Hence, it is challenging to control the style and quality of individual object instances. We propose an instance-quantized conditional generative model for the synthesis of images with high-fidelity instances of multiple classes. Specifically, we train two generators simultaneously: a scene generator that synthesizes the background environment and an instance generator that synthesizes each object instance individually. We design a differentiable image compositing layer that assembles the resulting image and allows effective error back-propagation. For our generators $$G_S$$ G S and $$G_I$$ G I we developed a new architecture leveraging modulated convolutional blocks. We evaluate our model and baselines on ADE20k , MHPv2 , and Cityscapes datasets to demonstrate that our instance-quantized framework outperforms baselines in terms of FID and mIoU scores. Moreover, our approach allows us to separately control the style of each object and learn fine texture details.

Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) are two of the most successful. However, GAs require specialist crossover operators for permutation problems to avoid repetition. Crossover operators such as Edge Recombination (ER) focus on preservation of parental edges but do not account for edge quality . However, ACO involves ants selecting edges based on pheromone and quality . Consequently, this paper proposes combining GAs and ACO via ER crossover (ER-ACO) whereby ants ensure the quality of preserved parental edges. Applied to a range of TSP instances the ER-ACO crossover method demonstrates considerable improvements over standard ER highlighting the importance of edge quality. Moreover, ER-ACO also demonstrates inserting high quality non-parental edges is highly beneficial. Indeed, ER-ACO crossover is able to achieve solutions within 1–2% of optimal for TSP instances of several thousand cities.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The research approach was to perform the essential tasks of locating, extracting, and formatting web text suitable for the corpus whilst identifying the primary issues. The project included the creation and development of core components to extract web text, segment the text into sentences, and align these sentences into the parallel text corpus. Despite the success of several techniques related to these stages of corpus construction, their performance is often poor when applied to text from languages that are considerably different from English, although these issues are not always reported. The primary challenge to corpus construction for Thai-English machine translation was identified as the segmentation of text into sentences. Sentence segmentation tools did not split Thai text into sentences that corresponded to the English sentences. Machine translation is reliant on parallel text having corresponding sentences with the same meaning. This issue was further compounded by the nature of web text, which made the text difficult to segment correctly when there were source-specific idiosyncrasies. Traditional alignment approaches are not as effective when applied independently to Thai text due to its nature and a lack of linguistic resources. Despite this, a combination of approaches for both the text extraction and alignment was successful when the sentence segmentation was not problematic.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Therefore, we study low power alternative for dynamic key generation and implement it in a LoRa-based WSN.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

In an MA-based system, a small-sized processing code is transmitted through the network rather than the raw data. Using strong migration capability, MA’s processing code is being executed at each targeted node. Subsequently, useful and significant information is delivered to the intended user. Despite its benefit, MA has its issues also. Finding the appropriate number of MAs to be dispatched, the set of targeted nodes and their sequence of migration are the major issues related to multi-mobile agent itinerary planning (MIP). This paper tries to find a suitable number of MAs by considering the size of the data payload of a single MA and the load to be carried out by the MAs from the whole network. Moreover, this paper gives an idea of partitioning the given network into load balanced and nonoverlapping clusters using a fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

The cloud is a huge improvement over the conventional computing as it has redesigned the way businesses operate. With the cloud, the information is virtualized and reduces the need of infrastructural based model. Businesses can operate through this tangible area, significantly reducing energy consumption and the need for excessive material resources. In recent years, computational technologies and ideas have transitioned to distant data centers and pay-per-use hardware and software solutions. However, as the number of information centers supporting cloud-based applications grows, vast quantities of energy are consumed, resulting to high prices and greenhouse emissions in the atmosphere. Going green emerged as a viable solution to this challenge. Green computing is a study field that intends to overcome energy and climate issues. Green sustainable cloud technology aims to accomplish not only effective processing and computing environment usage, but also to improve energy efficiency. This paper will address the possibilities of sustainable cloud technology, emerging developments, and strategies to increase data center efficiency, which also will minimize carbon emissions.

Consumer demand and ongoing technical advancement cause a serious problem as a consequence of this need and consumption. One of the issues now plaguing the world that is growing the quickest is E-waste. This article looks at how virtualization may abate the amount of e-waste produced and save resources. A comparison of E-waste management strategies and the optimal choice taking into account green computing has been shown. The model, which uses annual product sales data as well as historical and projected sales data as inputs, is a material flow analysis model. Future sales data are predicted using polynomial regression analysis for goods with increasing yearly sales and the sales rate for products with declining annual sales. Software that enables a single computer to perform several identical executions, each of which runs an operating system, is known as a hypervisor, or virtual machine monitor. By using those resources and the information from the models, the overall discussion on virtualization’s potential to reduce e-waste may be evaluated. As fewer portable computers and desktop computers are used, less electrical equipment is needed, which reduces the amount of power required. The hypervisor may also be set up to show how much less electronic waste results from virtualization. Therefore, even if virtualization won’t completely eradicate e-waste, it will significantly reduce it while having no negative effects on the environment.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Semantic learning of classifiers involves the knowledge of edge-labels, which is a complex problem in image processing. Here we examine several levels of information in order to adopt a feasible method where all edges required pixels for the continuous detection of the objects.

In financial markets, multiple orders are submitted almost simultaneously or within very quick succession; such orders are thought of as independent of one another. We call this phenomenon order simultaneity. If order simultaneity increases, tick-time-level data mining methods are assumed to worsen because the randomness of the order sequences increases. The present study analyzed this effect using artificial market simulations, which enable experimentation in a fully-controlled environment. As a data mining task, we employed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for the financial market to perform next order generation (prediction). We analyzed the impact of order simultaneity by applying the GAN to simulated data in artificial market simulations with various environmental parameters. We found that the effect of order simultaneity is limited for the next order generation task, which can be said to be the ultimate prediction task in financial markets. This analysis also supports the validity of the current approach of utilizing GANs to model order time series in financial markets. Moreover, our study demonstrates the utility of combining artificial market simulations and data mining.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Classification task is considered for the set of problems where images of Lyme disease symptoms were collected and structured in the open-access dataset with the different subsets of the whole dataset: clean images only (C), dirty images only (D), and clean and dirty images in the equal proportions (C_D) ( https://www.kaggle.com/yoctoman/lyme-clean-and-dirty ) . Two different data preprocessing techniques were applied: normalization without data augmentation (NODA) and normalization with data augmentation (DA). The two versions of the modern NASNet DNN architectures of different sizes were used, namely NASNetLarge and NASNetMobile, with the weights obtained after training on ImageNet dataset. These DNNs were trained in two experiments, namely with frozen layers, aka transfer learning (TL), and with unfrozen layers when all weights were updated (NOTL). After fivefold cross-validated training the best results for mean validation metrics were demonstrated by the models trained in C_NOTL_NODA, C_NOTL_DA, and C_TL_NODA experiments for NASNetLarge, and in C_TL_NODA by NASNetMobile. But the testing on the new unknown subset of Lyme disease images with the equal proportion of clean and dirty images gave quite different results. The models trained in the before-mentioned experiments demonstrated poor performance in comparison with the models trained in C_NOTL_DA, D_NOTL_DA experiments, and, especially in D_C_NOTL_DA ones. The successful training strategy should include tuning ImageNet-trained weights without their freezing (NOTL) and intensive data augmentation (DA), but it would not be enough if some diverse relevant background will not be added. That is why the additional methods of “context-relevant data augmentation” (CRDA) mimicked by inclusion of D_C data configuration should be considered. These findings can be used for the more effective selection of training experiments of DNNs in the healthcare context in the view of the small number of available medical data in practice.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

The goal is to design an allocation mechanism such that each worker is incentivized to invite her neighbours to join the allocation, although they are competing for the task. Moreover, the performance of each worker is uncertain, which is modelled as the quality level of her task execution. The literature has proposed solutions to tackle the uncertainty problem by paying them after verifying their execution. Here, we extend the problem to the network setting. The challenge is that the requester relies on the workers to invite each other to find the best worker, and the performance of each worker is also unknown to the task requester. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism to solve the two challenges at the same time. The mechanism guarantees that inviting more workers and reporting/performing according to her true ability is a dominant strategy for each worker. We believe that the new solution can be widely applied in the digital economy powered by social connections such as crowdsourcing and contests.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The proposed work proposes a hybrid model that tries to combine the feature extraction and feature reduction techniques thereby using both linear and non-linear techniques to take the best parts of both methods. After the initial ensemble is created still the feature set is further optimized by using the concept of entropy and information gain. Using mutual information, on further analysis the best non-redundant feature sets are selected after considering a specific threshold and using this as a testing tool the datasets are again analyzed to check the working accuracy. The model performance is found to be effective even using reduced feature sub-set. Also, it has been found apart from excelling in classification accuracy, the model has been successful in maintaining the range of the metric irrespective of the input size.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Statistics, general', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Storage Representation', 'Data Structures and Information Theory']"

The infection rate is continuously growing and it is becoming unmanageable since the virus moves easily from one human to another. Once we detect the COVID-19 virus in its early stages, we can easily reduce the death rate. The most common and widely used method of diagnosing COVID is through reverse transcription polymerase chain (RT-PCR). But the RT-PCR test is time consuming, inaccurate, and expensive. In this situation, the time period for the detection of viruses is valuable. Keeping these limitations in mind, we use an X-ray image of the chest to identify the COVID-19 infected patient.

El-MagdSewesy, Adel Abo Mohamed, Marghany Hassan Steganography is the technique of hiding a secret message inside a normal, non-confidential file, or message to avoid detection. The main challenge in steganography is to build a balanced system that resists attacks and hides a large amount of data while maintaining high quality. To overcome these challenges, many algorithms have been developed, some of which are better than others in a certain direction. In this chapter, an improved steganography approach is proposed where more than one method is combined to obtain a more secure algorithm with high quality and capacity. First, Gzip compression technique is used to compress the mystery message which increases the capacity of the proposed algorithm. Next, the p-Fibonacci method is used to randomize the locations of the pixels that hide the ambiguous message which improves the security of the proposed scheme. Then, the pixel value modification (PVM) technique with modulus function is used to embed the secret message raising the embedding capacity and quality. This approach overcomes the limitations of the previous methods because it is providing a secure with high embedding capacity system. To estimate the security of the proposed scheme, we used histogram, entropy, and chi-squared analysis to apply statistical attacks on the stego-image. Later, the experimental results show that the proposed methods provide high embedding capacity while maintaining good performance with large payload. For a payload of 204,800 B, we achieved a PSNR of 55.91 DB. The drawbacks of the previous methods are completely eliminated. The proposed scheme is more effective than previous steganography schemes in terms of quality, capacity, and security.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

The network used in IoT is low power and lossy networks which is commonly known as LLN. The components in LLN use low power for its operations. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has defined routing protocol for standardized LLN, i.e., routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL). The RPL selects suitable path to reach the destination by constructing the destination oriented directed acyclic graph (DODAG). The DODAG can be constructed based on the type of objective function. RPL commonly uses two objective functions they are, MRHOF and objective function zero. The objective function zero uses hop count as its metric, and MRHOF uses the metric of expected transmission count. Hence, selection of the energy efficient objective function plays an important role to make the network of IoT more energy efficient. In existing research, the superiority of MRHOF and OF0 is experimented using only simulation not using the real testbed. Hence, it is essential to conduct the experiment in real testbed to identify the energy efficient objective function. Future Internet of Things (FIT) lab is a platform to carry out the large-scale experimentation using testbed. In this paper, two objective functions MRHOF and OF0 are considered, and experiments are performed in FIT IoT-Lab to identify the energy efficient objective function. After the experiment, it is identified that objective function zero is more energy efficient than MRHOF. From the results of simulation and real testbed experiments, it is concluded that OF0 consumes less energy than the MRHOF.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The popularity of VANET is because of its increasing demand and its blend with the latest technologies like cloud, IoT, AI, and ML. The expansion in vehicles on the road and their communication leads to the need to use fog rather than cloud to provide low latency to a real-time system VANET. The fog computing together with VANET is termed as vehicular fog network although providing various advantages, but on the other side compromises the network’s security. To improve the security and privacy of the VANET system, blockchain an immutable, peer-to-peer, decentralized, and distributed ledger-based technology seems suitable for making VFN a safer and more reliable system. The combination of fog computing and blockchain technology with VANET is termed as blockchain-enabled intelligent vehicular fog network (BIVFN). This paper discusses the VFN also the architecture, and phases of BIVFN are explored in detail. BIVFN can attain the security and privacy requirements well because of blockchain and fog computing.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Mobile and Network Security', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.

According to Google surveys and reports every year, people face many difficulties on road. Traffic congestions due to inefficient signal management systems which not only causes time delay and stress but also costs health of traffic police due to inhalation of polluted air. Therefore, inefficient traffic management causes unwanted wait times and congestion which produces a lot of CO 2 , a huge amount practically. Due to inefficient traffic management system, Emergency vehicles such as Ambulance, Fire Engines, and Rescue vehicles may tend to lose lots of valuable seconds. During absence or error in the system causes the signals to go offline, thus causing chaos and accidents. It is a necessity to calculate the real time road traffic density for improved traffic management due to the ever-increasing population of vehicles every day. One of the most impacting elements is the efficiency of the traffic controller as a result there are lot of opportunities for improvement and its demand increases. In our proposed system, live CCTV footage is given as input and vehicles are detected with the help of artificial intelligence. The input undergoes image processing techniques, and the vehicle density is calculated. The green signal time is also computed from the obtained traffic density to avoid long waiting time at road intersections.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The eLUX lab, at the Smart Campus of the University of Brescia (Italy), is the first national cognitive building where educational spaces are monitored and dashboards promote the users’ awareness. There, a fixed IoT network allows gathering data to perform analytics for prompt fault detection and fine-tuning of the conditions and possibly of the energy management. However, the users’ involvement is paramount for correct tuning and customization, as indoor conditions can be measured by a sensor (e.g., temperature, humidity, illuminance, CO 2 concentration) located in a single point in the indoor space, while the parameters can strongly vary in the presence of, e.g., a fan coil or the distance from the windows and doors. To address this issue, an RTLS (Real-Time Location System) can be connected to the users’ direct and indirect feedback to support a precise definition of the indoor conditions and boost the improvement of the cognitive behaviour (i.e., automatic window opening or lighting dimming). In this chapter, we illustrate how the eLUX Lab can be enhanced to support the aggregate programming paradigm for offering resilient distributed services (exploiting an RTLS) that run on wearable devices without relying on the connection to a central server.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Computer Applications']"

This online social media culture is dynamic in nature, and the move from traditional media to digital media is growing increasingly popular among people. While conventional media will continue to be used less frequently in the future, the increasing use of online social networks (OSNs) will obfuscate the real information provided by traditional media. Genuine users provide material that is beneficial to the broader public; on the other hand, spammers transmit irrelevant or misleading content that turns social media into a front for spreading false information. Consequently, undesirable text or susceptible links might be delivered to targeted users. These fabricated texts are anonymous, and they are occasionally linked to possible URLs. A precise statistical classification for a piece of news is not possible with the current systems because of data limitations and communication types. We will look at a variety of research publications that employ a variety of strategies for master training in the prediction and detection of harmful material on social media websites and networks. In this study, we attempted to identify spam tweets from a large collection of tweets by utilizing TVC algorithm to identify it. When a content paper is incorporated in this manner, a brief summary produced by utilizing the most important keywords from the first document is known as summarization. It is necessary to have a dynamic approach of dealing with the condensed information that is supplied through Twitter feeds. This research presents a novel way for producing a major substance-based summary in a shorter period of time than previously available. We also propose to detect harmful tweets both offline and online and to do so in real time. Most notably, when compared to the other current frameworks, the proposed framework performs multi-subject summarization on an online dataset, which results in a reduction in the amount of time required.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

SC-PKI does not have any third-party centralized certification authorities (CAs) to issue, validate, and revoke the certificates. All these activities are executed by the smart contract on a dedicated blockchain network.

To improve upon the classic FBMC precoding scheme, we use a trimmed discrete fourier transform (DFT) in conjunction with one-tap scaling. SC-FDMA requires a cyclic prefix, but the proposed technique has the same peak-to-average power ratio and produces substantially less out-of-band radiation. Complex orthogonal restoration and FBMC ramp-up/ramp-down times are greatly decreased, making it possible for low-latency transmissions to be achieved. Our approach has only twice the computational complexity of pure SC-FDMA. Our assertions are backed up by simulations on channels with two levels of selection and a free MATLAB code. Note that a modified SC-FDMA transmission method can be viewed as a DFT-spread FBMC that has been trimmed. Traditional FBMC systems have more requirements for the filter, while the prototype filter has less of them. Software such as MATLAB is used throughout the entire endeavour.

This statement is especially true in the case of (very) large networks which cannot be reduced to compositions of simpler (e.g., series and parallel) networks, e.g., those containing complex bridge-type sub-networks. A promising, and not much explored approach, is to borrow concepts and methods from electrical circuits, in particular the delta-wye transformation which has long been established and used for computing exactly the equivalent resistance of a resistor network. We shall review how such concepts (from electronics) should be adapted and applied to reliability evaluations, showing that (as opposed to the case of electrical circuits) these are not always exact, hence sometimes leading to reliability estimates. We shall exemplify approximations of the reliability polynomials when using delta-wye transformations, and show that this approach is able to significantly reduce complexity. Finally, we will apply the delta-wye transformation method to the Moore-Shannon hammock networks (for the first time ever), and show how hammock networks can be transformed into ladder networks/graphs whose reliability can be easily computed by a recurrence formula.

The World Health Organization (WHO) tracks and classifies variants as variants of concern (VOCs) or variants of interest (VOIs), depending on the level of transmissibility and dominance of the variant in the regions. The classification and identification of variants usually occur through sequence alignment techniques, which are computationally complex, making them unfeasible to classify thousands of sequences simultaneously. In this work, an application of the alignment-free method BASiNETEntropy is proposed for the classification of the variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2. The method initially maps the biological sequences as a complex network. From this, the most informative edges are selected through the entropy maximization principle, getting a filtered network containing only the most informative edges. Thus, complex network topological measurements are extracted and used as features vectors in the classification process. Sequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern extracted from NCBI were used to assess the method. Experimental results show that extracted features can classify the variants of concern with high assertiveness, considering few features, contributing to the reduction of the feature space. Besides classifying the variants of concern, unique patterns (motifs) were also extracted for each variant, relative to the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence.

People are not aware that their communication with the outside world can be intercepted and all sensitive and secret information stolen from them, while they completely rely on and believe in the implemented safety principles from various service providers. No matter how sophisticated the system is, every system is vulnerable. Therefore, in this paper, we present the StegYou model for hiding, retrieving, and detecting digital data in images. Our implementation of hiding and retrieving data is based on a custom made crypt-steganography algorithm for one or more images. By applying crypt-steganography techniques for secure data transfer between spatially-distributed individuals, the model will strive to reach the highest level of confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of the user’s confidential and sensitive data. Also, StegYou can detect hidden data in given images with the help of machine learning methods.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The survivability of a human being is a challenging issue when the BT is in a severe stage. So, it is very much essential for the diagnosis of the BT in the early stage. In this work, a machine intelligent (MI)-based approach is proposed for the classification of BT images (BTIs) into several categories such as glioma, meningioma, and pituitary using SqueezeNet deep neural network embedder. This work is focused on different machine learning (ML)-based methods such as K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), neural network (NN), and logistic regression (LR) for the processing of BTIs. The performance of each method is assessed using the classification accuracy (CA) performance parameter. This work is carried out using Orange 3.26.0.

doi:10.1007/978-981-19-7083-2_3,en,Evolutionary Multi-objective Federated Learning,OriginalPaper,"Different from model quantization and partial model uploads presented in the previous chapter, evolutionary federated learning, more specifically, evolutionary federated neural architecture search, aims to optimize the architecture of neural network models, thereby reducing the communication costs caused by frequent model transmissions, generating lightweight neural models that are better suited for mobile and other edge devices, and also enhancing the final global model performance. To achieve this, scalable and efficient encoding methods for deep neural architectures must be designed and evolved using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. This chapter presents two multi-objective evolutionary algorithms for federated neural architecture search. The first one employs a probabilistic representation of deep neural architectures that describes the connectivity between two neighboring layers and simultaneously maximizing the performance and minimizing the complexity of the neural architectures using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. However, this evolutionary framework is not practical for real-time optimization of the neural architectures in a federated environment. To tackle this challenge, a real-time federated evolutionary neural architecture search is then introduced. In addition to adopting a different neural search space, a double sampling strategy, including sampling subnetworks from a pretrained supernet and sampling clients for model update, is proposed so that the performance of the neural architectures becomes more stable, and each client needs to train one local model in one communication round, thereby preventing sudden performance drops during the optimization and avoiding training multiple submodels in one communication round. This way, evolutionary neural architecture search is made practical for real-time real-world applications.","['Computer Science', 'Machine Learning', 'Privacy', 'Cryptology']"

The classification of Alzheimer's disease is an important topic that has recently been addressed by many studies using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods. Most research papers tackling early diagnosis of AD use these methods as a feature extractor for neuroimaging data. In our research paper, the proposed algorithm is to optimize the performance of the prediction of early diagnosis from the multimodal dataset by a multi-step framework that uses a Deep Neural Network (DNN) as an optimization technique to extract features and train these features by Random Forest (RF) classifier. The results of the proposed algorithm showed that using only demographic and clinical data results in a balanced accuracy of 88% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 94.6. Ultimately, combining clinical and neuroimaging features, prediction results improved further to a balanced accuracy of 92% and an AUC of 97%. This study successfully outperformed other studies for both clinical and the combination of clinical and neuroimaging data, proving that multimodal data is efficient in the early diagnosis of AD.","['Computer Science', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Computer Communication Networks', 'Database Management', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.

The proposed approach is applied to optimize the geometry parameters of a flat plate heat sink such as the heat sink is length, width, fin height, base height, fin thickness, and number of fins and the multiobjective functions are minimization of the thermal resistance and emitted radiations of the heat sink. Also, the trained ANFIS model is used to predict the performance of the multiple outputs given the combination of input parameters. The multiple responses such as emitted radiations and thermal resistance are optimized by 22.18% with respect to the original design. Also, this method serves to reduce the search space for a given problem. Using the reduced search space, genetic algorithm (GA) was used at the second level of optimization to further improve the performance by upto 34.12% compared to the original design.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-11748-0_12,en,From Theoretical to Practical Transfer Learning: The ADAPT Library,OriginalPaper,"In traditional machine learning, the learner assumes that the training and testing datasets are drawn according to the same distribution. However, in most practical scenarios, the two datasets are drawn according to two different distributions, the source distribution and the target distribution. In this context, the use of classical machine learning algorithms often fails as models trained on the source data provide poor performances on the target data. To solve this problem, many transfer learning techniques have been developed following one of the three main strategies: parameter-based transfer, instance-based transfer and feature-based transfer. The choice of the appropriate strategy is mainly determined by the nature of the shift between the source and target distributions. For example, to deal with the problem of sampling bias, when part of the population is over- or under-represented in the training set, instance-based approaches are useful to adequately reweight the source data in the training phase. If the shift is caused by a change in data acquisition, such as sensor drift, feature-based methods help to correct the shift by learning a common feature representation for the source and target data. For a real application, it is really a challenge to choose in advance the best transfer learning strategy and one often needs to evaluate different models in practice. As the different transfer methods were introduced by various contributors, no common framework is today available for a rapid development. To tackle this issue, we propose a Python library for transfer learning: ADAPT (Awesome Domain Adaptation Python Toolbox), which allows practitioners to compare the results of many methods on their particular problem. ADAPT is an open-source library providing the implementation of several transfer learning methods. The library is suited for scikit-learn estimator objects (objects which implement fit and predict methods) and tensorflow models. It allows to evaluate very easily the benefits of transfer learning methods on real data. In this chapter, we propose to illustrate the different features of the ADAPT library on both synthetic and real datasets.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning']"

However, such systems entail significant infrastructure maintenance costs. This paper focuses on autonomous operations and autonomous distributed control methods in which ICRs first share task and location information, and then distribute upcoming tasks among themselves based on that shared information. However, when each ICR is required to communicate with all the other ICRs in a distributed system, the number of wireless communications will increase with the number of system ICRs, thereby wasting wireless communication resources.

After complete eye evaluation, SD-OCT (Optopol Technologies, Copernicus, Zawierci, Poland) was performed in 801 eyes of 435 subjects known to have diabetes (cases) and 58 eyes of 31 age-matched individuals without diabetes (controls). Using customized software, we compared the number of pixels in the light and dark areas of the OCT. The software was set so as to proceed further only if at least 85% of the 7 mm OCT line scan was clear enough for analysis. The pixel analysis investigation comprised OCT pictures of patients with diabetes mellitus but no retinopathy ( N  = 482) and those without diabetes ( N  = 33) from the images analyzed. The mean numbers of dark pixels in cases and controls were 8488.68 ± 3094.70 and 6794.85 ± 1877.83, respectively, ( p  < 0.001). No significant difference in the light pixel and LD ratio was found between the groups. The cutoff value for dark pixels by ROC analysis was 6795 pixels with sensitivity and specificity of 67% and 52%, respectively. Abnormal dark pixel values did not correlate with the functional characteristics of the study subjects. Pixel analysis shows evidence of early neuronal degeneration in people with diabetes but no retinopathy, an increase in dark pixels suggesting neuronal damage.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

Football as a sport is only growing more and more popular every day. It is currently the world’s most-watched sport and has the highest viewership audience. As a result, a whole industry has arisen around this sport with one important part of it being FIFA. The amount of budget allocated and the number of persons involved in a Football game directly or indirectly can affect the financial budget of a person to a federation's finance. In such cases, player selection for a finalist from the federation is the most crucial task. Every year different approaches were investigated for player selections, but none of them was regarded as the best approach for team selection. Thus, there is a need for a standard approach for finding out the perfect players for their teams with the exact qualities that they demand. In response, we have developed a machine learning model that predicts players who could replace a current existing player in a team. Along with that, we have also incorporated Data Analytics that helps us decide which factors would be more important than others. The proposed prediction model is implemented and the results of our machine learning (SAGA-ML) tool are applied to Electronics Arts’ FIFA Soccer game.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

As there are multiple flying objects, including airplanes, birds, helicopters, drones and so on, which can only fly to move from one place to another place, it is necessary to detect these objects accurately by regularly monitoring the existence of malicious UAVs. A malicious UAV carrying unnecessary payload is the one that can cause severe harm to the environment. This malicious UAV activity should be detected by differentiating it from other flying objects. In this work, the malicious UAV with unnecessary load is detected in a computer vision-based monitoring system, which is driven by supervised machine intelligence model and SqueezeNet, a deep neural network-based image embedder. The models used for accurately classifying the malicious UAV images are neural network (NN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), naïve Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbour (k-NN), AdaBoost (AB) and logistic regression (LR). Simulation process has been carried out in Orange 3.26.0 data analytics tool. From the result, it is evident that the neural networks (NNs) have generated higher classification accuracy (CA) of about 92.01% for accurately detecting the malicious UAV images by classifying the malicious UAVs from other flying object images.

Consequently, the increase in life expectancy combined with the ageing of the population has created the ideal conditions for the introduction of Intelligent Wheelchairs (IWs). For this purpose, several adapted sensors should be used to optimize the control of a wheelchair. During this work, the Leap Motion sensor was analyzed to convert the user’s will into one of four fundamental driving commands, move forward, turn right, left, or stop. Leap Motion aims to determine the direction to follow according to the hand gesture identified. For this task, data was collected from volunteers while they were performing certain gestures. Thereby it was possible to produce a data set that after being processed and extracted some features enabled the classification of the data with an F1-Score higher than 0.97. Additionally, when tested in a real-time application, this sensor reinforced its high performance.","['Computer Science', 'Robotics', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Intelligence']"

The community is maintained by numerous user machines forming a “peer-to-peer” network. With the recent skyrocket of crypto-assets in the financial markets, many view it as the quickest and riskiest way to earn. Such assets are coined as “Volatile” due to its rapidly fluctuating price, thereby making it extremely hard to forecast its course. The paper at hand explores a novel technique that establishes a relation between signal processing and volatile stock forecasting methods via variational mode decomposition (VMD). Variational mode decomposition aided with BiLSTM neural architecture, a purely data-driven model, is fine-tuned to forecast the daily or interday prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum alongside yielded RMSE of 0.0278 for Bitcoin. The results are then further compared with ARIMA, ARMA and MA to analyse the effect of VMD.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Recent studies have raised concerns that this increasing popularity has exacerbated issues of unfairness and discrimination toward individuals. Researchers in this field have proposed a wide variety of fairness-enhanced classifiers and fairness matrices to address these issues, but very few fairness techniques have been translated into the real-world practice of data-driven decisions. This work focuses on individual fairness, where similar individuals need to be treated similarly based on the similarity of tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel model of individual fairness that transforms features into high-level representations that conform to the individual fairness and accuracy of the learning algorithms. The proposed model produces equally deserving pairs of individuals who are distinguished from other pairs in the records by data-driven similarity measures between each individual in the transformed data. Such a design identifies the bias and mitigates it at the data preprocessing stage of the machine learning pipeline to ensure individual fairness. Our method is evaluated on three real-world datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness: the credit card approval dataset, the adult census dataset, and the recidivism dataset.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computers and Education', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.

The applications of AI and ML are proving disruptive across the global technological spectrum, and there is practically no area which has been left untouched by these technologies right from computer science to manufacturing, healthcare, insurance, credit ratings, cybersecurity, and many more. It would not be an exaggeration to say that it is the next big thing after the advent of the Internet and potentially holds a similar impact in touching the lives of human beings. Whilst most researchers using machine learning in research across diverse domains do not need to look beyond the model abstraction for their work, the need for understanding what is happening beneath the surface is sometimes necessary. This becomes especially important in the cases where the predictions are too good to be apparently true, and the researcher running the model is not sure about its validity as the logic for prediction is obscure. The process of feature engineering brings in more accuracy to predictions, but in the absence of intuitive background information regarding the features, the task gets more challenging. The scientific reasoning has been driven by logic through ages, and the scientist community remains sceptical of the results unless they can extract useful insights from the black box ML models. The paper applies five popular explainability algorithms being used by the research community to demystify the abstract nature of ML black box models and compare the relative clarity of the insights being provided individually by each from a practitioner’s perspective using the publicly available UCI wine quality dataset.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

It spans two neighboring countries, namely India and Bangladesh. In this article, we strive to assess the vegetation health of the Sundarbans region. We rely on the satellite images from Landsat 8 from January 2014 to January 2020. The vegetation health assessment is based on two indices, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and forest canopy density (FCD) analysis of the interest area. NDVI consists of two bands: red and infrared band, showing a negative trend of 0.0085 per year. The image difference technique is employed further to study the vegetation health of the area of interest. NDVI difference marks the coastal regions with a higher depletion rate of vegetation than the regions away from the sea coasts. The histogram of the NDVI difference shows a negative shift from the central zero axis, which is the zone of no change in the vegetation cover. Being an early model to study vegetation health, NDVI has some disadvantages. It tends to quickly saturates at high biomass content and blurs the difference between moderately high plant cover from very high plant cover. So, we have taken another model, FCD, to compare the results of NDVI with it. It highlights the sharp depletion of highly forested cover. Nearly, 80% of the highly forested region has been depleted and joins the medium forested area. The overall mangrove cover is likely to dip more in the ensuing decades if governments of the two countries do not take necessary measures.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics']"

Here using facial analysis method, food recipes rating application is developed. Some recipes might be authentic and few recipes might not be authentic. The recipes which you are choosing to order will never be similar as the visualized one. The quality and taste differs based on the preparation. So here a system is proposed, in order to get right recipes with healthy and good taste. The user has to select the variety and post the reviews of recipes online. All the recipes are reviewed, commented and rated by the visitors of the certain regional foods. So the customers may choose correct recipes online. These food items are being sorted according to the comments which are received from the users by applying facial analysis approach using machine learning named as Haar Cascade algorithm for mining the data. Here machine learning approach is used in which machine learns and analyses the facial expressions and emotions which reveals through the review. As the reviews are usually high in numbers, the visitors ends up with spending lots of time for searching non-casual food grounded on the peoples who participated by submitting reviews. This design will sort food items found on the bottom of facial analysis which represents the emoticon of the critics. The results will be shown with the help of a mobile application. The administrator will add watchwords and emoticon which are pertinent to the recipes in this application. In this methodology the watchwords which are matching up in the comments submitted by the visited customers and correspondingly the application will rate the recipes. On this application, based on the best-case emoticon reviews, the food will be listed on the top. This will make a more genuine review about the product. If this application has got implemented and installed in the device, further an update will be announced that users can review and view more than one particular product.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

When offloading parts of a robot’s processing to the cloud, system performance and safety become highly dependent on the capacity of network and cloud technologies to fulfill a given set of requirements. This is further complicated when the robot must interact with a person, and HRI may be compromised by poor QoS. Although research in the field of cloud-enabled and human-in-the-loop CPS has gained traction in the last years, there is still a need for systematically setting the requirements posed by the interplay of these factors. This results in a lack of understanding of how infrastructure-related QoS issues inherent to cloud robotics affect user-perceived QoE during HRI. In this chapter, we use the eHealth field to highlight the importance of understanding a system’s requirements during cloud integration. By the end of the chapter, we present a case study considering cloud-enabled robots used for assisting human locomotion. This kind of system relies on close physical HRI and imposes multiple challenges on the adoption of cloud robotics. We finalize by discussing the impacts of overall QoS in the perceived QoE when a user interacts with a robot.","['Engineering', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Robotics', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT']"

Although parking maneuvering has reached the level of fully automated valet parking, there are still many challenges to realize the parking motion planning in the presence of dynamic obstacles. One of the most famous autonomous driving platforms is the Baidu Apollo platform. In the Apollo platform, this problem is solved using the classic method hybrid A*. However, this method has two main downsides. Firstly, it generates in some parking scenarios, trajectories that consist of many partitions with different gear types and sizes. Such trajectories are intractable by a self-driving car when testing the Apollo planner on more realistic data coming from a simulator such as SVL. Secondly, the built-in algorithm does not have the ability to interact with dynamic obstacles, which might lead to a collision in some critical parking scenarios. To overcome these issues, we proposed a method based on reinforcement learning, which uses the RL-policy (from POLAMP) allowing us to take into account the kinematic constraints of the vehicle, static and dynamic obstacles. The proposed method was fully integrated into the Apollo platform with developed Cyber RT nodes, which were used for publishing the parking trajectory from our algorithm to the SVL simulator through a ROS/Cyber bridge. The final model demonstrates transferability to the previously unseen experimental environments and flexibility with respect to built-in hybrid A*.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

However, it seems to be impossible in large-group lectures at educational institutions or newcomer education at companies. Therefore, instructors attempt to grasp the understanding status of many learners at once by using written tests and e-learning to find out the learners who need instruction. They examine the learner’s knowledge such as algorithm and syntax. However, in reality, not a few learners fail to acquire the skill of writing source codes. This kind of situation implies that the programming ability of learners cannot be measured only by knowledge tests or the data obtained from answer results. The purpose of this study is to estimate the understanding of programming, focusing on the thinking process. This paper analyzes a time series of operations of learners working on code puzzles, where they arrange code fragments. Since we assumed learners with low understanding are different from those with high in terms of the consistency of blocks of code fragments to be touched, we modeled it using a hidden Markov model. The proposed method estimates their perspectives on how fragments are built up to achieve given requirements. The results of an experiment have shown that the calculated hidden Markov model produces meaningful interpretable values. Furthermore, the values show significant indices that machine learning models can explain the understanding of learners.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Smartphones‚ in particular, stand out as being an ideal self-tracking technology that permits both active logging (via self-reports) and passive tracking of information (via phone logs and mobile sensors). In this chapter, we present the results of a literature review of smartphone-based personal informatics studies across three different disciplinary databases (computer science, psychology, and communication). In doing so, we propose a conceptual framework for organizing the smartphone-based personal informatics literature. Our framework situates self-tracking studies based on their substantive focus across two domains: (1) the measurement domain (whether the study uses subjective or objective data) and (2) the outcome of interest domain (whether the study aims to promote insight or change in physical and/or mental characteristics). We use this framework to identify and discuss research trends and gaps in the literature. For example, most research has been concentrated on tracking of objective measurements to change either physical or mental characteristics, while less research used subjective measures to study a physical outcome of interest. We conclude by pointing to promising future directions for research on self-tracking and personal informatics and emphasize the need for a greater appreciation of individual differences in future self-tracking research.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Health Informatics', 'Health Psychology', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction']"

Because medical imaging is a way of determining the health status of a person, the threats could have grave consequences. These threats are not only dangerous to the individual but also threaten the patients’ trust in modern diagnosis methods and in the healthcare sector as a whole. As recent diagnosis tools are based on artificial intelligence and machine learning, they can be exploited using attack technologies such as image perturbations, adversarial patches, adversarial images, one-pixel attacks, and training process tampering. These methods take advantage of the non-robust nature of many machine learning models created to solve medical imaging classification problems, such as determining the probability of cancerous cell growth in tissue samples. In this study, we review the current state of these attacks and discuss their effect on medical imaging. By comparing the known attack methods and their use against medical imaging, we conclude with an evaluation of their potential use against medical imaging.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Privacy', 'Cryptology', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

Researchers are trying their best to come up with solutions that can combat COVID-19. It is slated that the world has to battle with it and to follow SOP’s until and unless an effective vaccine will be developed. On the technological side, IoT is a new and promising area to combat with the COVID-19 Pandemic. Nowadays, smartphones and wearables have various onboard sensors like temperature sensor, proximity sensor, an audio sensor, camera, inertial sensor, color sensor, etc. that can be used in getting the data of a person. The temperature sensor reading can tell us the temperature of a person. Based on that reading, a person can be sent for further clinical tests at an initial level. IoT technology can accurately manage patient information, and can be effective in proactive diagnosis with reduced cost. The IoT technology, a set of well-organized components, can work together as a part of an system to fight against and will lower the spread of the COVID-19 Virus. IoT has gained considerable attention from almost every field, such as industries and especially from healthcare. IoT technology is reshaping the traditional healthcare system by incorporating technology into it. In this article, a IoT layered architecture have been proposed with three different layers. The detailed working of all three layers is explained. A novel IoTFEC-19 framework has been proposed to detect COVID-19 suspects early with sensors and wearable devices. The Framework consists of three layers: Sensing Layer or Data Collection Layer, Data Analytics Layer, and Prediction Layer. In Sensing Layer, different sensors are used to collect the data and send it for analysis. In Analysis Layer, the level of symptoms is calculated from the data received from the Sensing Layer. The third layer is the Prediction Layer, in which prediction is made from the computed values in Analysis Layer, whether the suspected may be COVID-19 positive or negative. The last layer is the cloud layer used for storage services and data used for further analysis. The proposed IoTFEC framework aims to detect the COVID-19 suspected early, provide early treatment, and stop further spreading.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']"

Domestic violence can portray verbally and physically in several ways (for instance, between partners or against children and older people). Deep Learning (DL) combined with the Internet of Things (IoT) technology could support the detection of domestic violence, which is one of many societal issues. This paper describes a system that uses a Deep Learning model and smart microphones to identify domestic violence. The datasets used are from the Google AudioSet (GA) and from the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS). For the training of the dataset, the system used spectrograms and MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients). The system employs two approaches: (i) an ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model, and (ii) a ResNet model. The Resnet model obtained an accuracy of 71%. The ANN model, which brought an accuracy of 83%, was tested and loaded to a Raspberry Pi, i.e., connected to the microphone for audio recording.

Although several methodologies have been proposed in the literature to study hierarchical relationships among quantitative variables, very little has been done for more general mixed-type data sets. Hence, it is of the utmost importance to extend these methods and make them suitable to the even more frequent availability of mixed-type data matrices, as complex real phenomena are often described by both qualitative and quantitative variables.

Artificial intelligence (AI) based on deep learning algorithmic methods has been widely adopted by researchers in health care for speech recognition, image processing, etc. Similarly, these deep learning methods can be useful in predicting the eyesight of a person. In order to check eyesight, we need refractometer, but due to its high cost, it is very rarely available in rural areas. Also, there are no online means to check your eyesight which leads to more difficulties. So, in this paper, we have proposed a model on the data we have collected from the survey which contained questions set by an ophthalmologist Vikas Saraswat for the prediction of axis, spherical power, cylindrical power, and addition power. These are the essential factors for the detection of eyesight power. Experimental results were shared with graphical representation comparing the traditional methods for the detection with the proposed models.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Mobile and Network Security', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Doubly truncated data appear in some applications with survival and astrological data. In the present communication, we obtain further results based on this measure. The effect of monotone transformations and affine transformation on this measure are discussed. It is shown that WDTE characterizes the distribution uniquely. Further, new uncertainty order is obtained.

Hence, the bandwidth is reduced in traditional scheme. To overcome the problem, non-orthogonal multiple access is used to increase the efficiency of spectrum in 5G communications. Non-orthogonal multiple access is used in this method to allow the subordinate user to enter the gamut even when forecast client is attending or not attending the conduit. Foremost client decryption technique and subordinate client decryption technique are introduced to decrypt the non-orthogonal signs. Hence, through the decoding techniques, secondary user throughput can be achieved; to increase the primary user throughput, duct channel energy must be in a limit. However due to the disturbance caused by the foremost client, the subordinate efficiency may be decreased. Orienting toward foremost user first deciphering and subordinate user first decoding. Here, we come up with two enhancement problems to enhance the efficiency of both primary client and secondary client. This is done using jointly optimizing spectrum resource (Gayatri et al. in Mobile Netw Appl 6:435–441 [ 1 ]). This citation embracing how much amount of sub-channel transmission power is used, and also, it enhances the number of sub-channels present in it. This type of citation is to enhance optimization problems. Jointly optimization algorithm is introduced to eliminate the existing problem. This is achieved by accepting the signs and calculating the time needed to sense gamut and the forecast client attending or not attending the conduit to decrypt the data sent while forecast client is absent (Ghasemi and Sousa in IEEE Commun Mag 46:32–39 [ 2 ]).

This work proposes a scalable framework enabled by a Machine Learning (ML) model to profile customers to identify their emotions to help to drive campaigns. A multi-platform mobile application continuously profiles consumers crossing the front stores. Profiling customers according to their age and hair color, the color of their eyes, and emotions (e.g. happiness, sadness, disgust, fear) will help companies to make the most suitable advertisement (e.g. to predict whether the advertising tones on the front store are the adequate ones). All that data are made available in web portal dashboards, wherein subscribers can take their analysis. Such results from the analysis data help them to identify tendencies regarding the culture and age, and drive companies to fit front stores accordingly (e.g. to discover the right tones for the season).

In a pandemic, they can also, by identifying the causes of higher mortality, predict a higher number of hospitalizations in intensive care units. The theory of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), which is one of the first extensions of fuzzy sets of Zadeh, analyzes uncertain data. Uncertainty in data determines the need for the introduction of intuitionistic fuzzy HCISs (IFHCISs) for digital transformation of these processes which analyze uncertain data. The main determinant of the effectiveness of IFHCISs for diagnosing and treatment of diseases, prediction of ICU admission of patients during the pandemic and determining the main factors for higher mortality in pandemics is the optimal multicriteria system. An intuitionistic fuzzy interpretation of the classical rank correlation analyzes under the form of intercriteria analysis (ICrA) is proposed for optimizing each evaluation system of criteria in IFHCISs, based on the theories of index matrices and IFSs. The purpose of the chapter is to develop a model for successful optimization of multicriteria systems embedded in IFHCISs by expanding three-dimensional ICrA to multilayer ICrA (3-D MLICrA). The current pandemic situation raises problems about the dependence of pandemy deaths on certain factors. These problems have to process large data sets related to Covid’s mortality, some of which differ in the various reports.

To better understand the factors that foster or hinder people’s interaction with a particular technology, acceptance models such as TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) or the UTAUT (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) are commonly used. However, in the case of humanoid social and service robotics these models may have some drawbacks, as the acceptance towards such robots not only depends on their functions and capabilities but on their shape and movement capability. For that reason, if acceptance models are intended to be used for robot evaluation, it is necessary to adequately design and pilot them in order to have well tested evaluation tools prior to hands-on technology assessment. With that aim, this work presents a pilot study which has been carried out with a group of elderly students at the university of the third age - Programa de la Experiencia of the Universidad Pontificia de Salamanca. The goal is to select the most suitable tools found in the literature to assess the acceptance of a companion robot for the elderly, which is currently under development, and to test the suitability of these tools before conducting experiments with the real robotic platform.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The early detection of pneumonia is important to prevent this intolerable death. Basically, images from chest x-ray can be used to detect pneumonia. However, it is a very challenging task for an expert radiologist to detect the disease accurately. The condition can be complicated due to the deficiency of medical equipment and workforce. Therefore, only the radiologist can hamper the treatment process because it needs a human expertise, effort, and time. In such a situation, It is necessary to use a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system that can identify pneumonia from datasets automatically and more accurately. In this work, an enhanced deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks is proposed for the radiologist to make their decision. It is an unsupervised algorithm that allows you to extract features automatically that are more useful for classification. For balancing datasets partial data augmentation technique is applied. The CNN based models including AlexNet, ResNet34, VGG16 and SqueezeNet1_0 are trained with our own dataset and their results are evaluated using a confusion matrix. Finally the results of the improved CNN model are compared with the results of the pre-trained models. The experiment shows that the improved CNN model performs better based on accuracy compared to all other pre-trained models.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The posts or comments collected from the social networking sites are needed to be analysed for identifying the positive or negative public sentiments regarding the products or services of any organization in order to improve their services. Over the last few years, research on sentiment analysis using Machine Learning (ML) tools is very popular. However, the sentiment analysis of Bengali data corpus using a Machine Learning tool is limited. It has been observed that the ML models for sentiment analysis are suffering from misclassification and researchers are still trying to come up with better solutions. In this paper, a Machine Learning approach is proposed for sentiment analysis of the Bengali data set collected from Facebook. Since the posts or comments that exhibit negative polarity are more actionable than the positive ones, the prime aim of this paper is to identify the negative sentiments without being misclassified and introduces a new technique to achieve almost 100% specificity by tuning the class weight of the ML classification model. We have also tried to improve the accuracy of ML classifiers during the sentiment analysis by combining the Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging with Term Frequency—Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization. The overall accuracy of each ML classifier for combining the POS tagging with TF-IDF shows an increment of 2.74–4.17% from the TF-IDF vectorization without combining with POS tagging.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Statistics, general', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Storage Representation', 'Data Structures and Information Theory']"

A news release from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in 2020 revealed over 40,000 people were declared missing in Africa. A staggering percentage of that number, a little over 23,000, is documented in Nigeria alone. Despite the numerous factors surrounding missing persons globally, at more than 50% of the original figure, it is unsurprising that most of the cases in Nigeria are attributed to the insurgency and security mishap that has plagued the country for almost a decade. Some of the cases remain unsolved for years, causing the victims to remain untraceable, thereby taking up a different identity and existence, especially if they went missing. Current solutions to find missing persons in Nigeria revolve around word of mouth, media and print announcements, and more recently, social media. These solutions are inefficacious, slow, and do not adequately help find and identify missing persons, especially in situations where time is a determining factor. The use of a facial recognition system with deep learning functionality can help Nigerian law enforcement agencies, and other human rights organizations and friends and families of the missing person speed up the search and find process. Our experimental system combines facial recognition with deep learning using a convoluted neural network. In this study, the authors have used high-standard facial calibration and modeling for feature extraction.

Different types of tags have been used, such as those related to the musical genre, others related to the emotions evoked by the song, and others related to the user's context of action or activity. These tags are usually provided by users in social networks and are often present in popular songs in the catalog. However, new songs added to the catalog or those belonging to the long tail do not have these tags and the need arises to create auto-taggers capable of tagging these songs. Several works and datasets have been proposed in the literature to solve this problem. In this paper we propose to infer activity context tags from simple song features obtained from the Spotify streaming service.

This tool is used across the company by various stakeholders, such as mainly the employees and customers, to find their answers to their questions about the organization’s know-how. The knowledge management system is, therefore, a very indispensable tool of every software company. However, many such systems are proved ineffective due to a lack of motivation from employees either in using the system or in maintaining the system. Therefore, the aim of this research is to critically analyze the knowledge management systems used by software companies in Mauritius and provide a model or framework for the gamification of a KMS that will help incentivize knowledge management and knowledge sharing to increase the effectiveness of a KMS. A quantitative method will mainly be adopted in this research. The target population will be the stakeholders involved in software development, such as software developers, software testers, team leads, and project managers. Data collected via the surveys will be analyzed to have an in depth review of the KMS and what challenges the software industry of Mauritius is facing with respect to knowledge management and how can some of these challenges be addressed. A total of 173 responses were received from various software firms. Among those respondents, 85% agreed that they were not motivated to participate in knowledge management and 94.8% believed that a gamification framework would be beneficial to boost user engagement in knowledge management systems.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

In the iterative and combinational process of finding the most optimal results, an Improved Global Harmonic Search (IGHS) algorithm has been used, in combination with the Matpower tool in order to solve radial power fluxes. For the purpose of locating the buses where the best results are obtained, and to reduce the search space, a Loss Sensitivity Factor (LSF) was used. In the minimization model, voltage restrictions, power factor, and reactive overcompensation were considered; the time considered for the study was fifteen years. To test the method used, two model radial systems (IEEE 33 and 69 buses) have been optimized. The technical and economic analysis of the results, allows us to conclude that the investment in reactive compensation equipment for the two model systems is recommended, and brings improvements corcerning not using them, the implementation will allow solving problems concerning losses, better use of the networks, the longer useful life of the equipment connected to it, power factor correction, and voltage improvement. The study with capacitors with automatic steps is presented, since compared to better technology equipment they are more economical and practical for their application in radial distribution networks, whose characteristic is that they reach many kilometers in length. For more polluted networks where capacitors cannot be used, this study can serve as a starting point for the location and sizing of other compensation devices.","['Social Sciences', 'Sociology, general', 'Urban Studies/Sociology']"

At the second stage, expert determined the confidence measure in various attributes (characteristics) of signs. The knowledge base is implemented since a fuzzy disease model that uses ontologies to integrate diverse information and includes a comprehensive expert assessment of signs (modality, manifestation, degree of expression).

However, traditional fuzzy classifiers and evidential classifiers may encounter two issues when facing data with high uncertainty. For one thing, the knowledge represented by the classifier may be in conflict, making classification difficult. For the other thing, most classifiers only consider one type of uncertainty. Hence, in this paper, information volume-based fuzzy evidential classifier (IV-FEC) is proposed by considering both the fuzziness and the total uncertainty (TU) of the classification problem. IV-FEC incorporates fuzzy information volume (FIV) and evidential information volume (EIV) for conflict management under the different types of uncertainty. FIV and EIV respectively estimate the fuzziness of the Gaussian membership degree of the samples and the TU for each attribute. An FIV and EIV-based discounting technique is utilized to modify the mass functions in order to manage conflicts in evidence combination and improve classification performance. The proposed IV-FEC is applied in target classification and verified based on several experiments. The results show that IV-FEC has a better classification accuracy compared with the existing models.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Computational Intelligence']"

Damage detection, classification, and localization is a part of the lower levels of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and is critical for damage diagnosis. SHM is an extremely useful tool for ensuring integrity and safety, detecting the evolution. Early damage detection and understanding of damage creation can avoid situations that can be catastrophic. X-ray tomography is a powerful tool for research as well as damage diagnostics. But high-resolution tomography results in high measuring and computational times up to 10 h for one specimen. The paper presents an early method of accessing the sections of the FML for identifying internal damages using X-ray imaging by optimized and adaptive zooming and scanning using automatic Region-of-Interest extraction with Machine Learning methods. The generated knowledge and the image data collected would further accelerate the development in the field of autonomous SHM of the composite and hybrid structures like fibre metal laminates which would further reduce the safety risks and total time associated with structural integrity assessment.

In contrast to earlier definitions, Dwork defined differential privacy as a relative guarantee that nothing more could be learned from data whether an individual observation is included or excluded from the analysis. This was achieved by adding random noise that is bigger than the effect of a change due to the largest single participant. The approach was referred as 𝜖-differential privacy.

In this chapter, following an in-depth review of state-of-the-art solutions for scaling blockchain networks, key design challenges and techniques are identified in terms of epoch randomness generation, network traffic model, and consensus committee configuration. Focusing on scalable and secure random committee selection, this chapter introduces an epoch randomness-enabled consensus committee configuration (ECOM) scheme. A proof-of-concept prototype is implemented and evaluated on a physical network that uses Raspberry Pis to simulate IoT devices. The experimental results show that the proposed ECOM protocol efficiently guarantees unpredictable randomness generation and committee selection under a small-scale byzantine network environment.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security']"

The goal is to plan reconfiguration order of connections without the interrupting flow. This problem is difficult to resolve because of the dependencies between the initial routing and the new routing. Existing works propose reconfiguration solutions that use backup path resources to temporarily move some connections. The final routing is found as you go. In this work, we reconfigure the initial routing to a new precomputed routing. This causes new dependencies in addition to those existing between the shared backup paths, increasing the difficulty of the process. To solve this problem, we use dependency graphs and backup resources. Simulation results show that our approach is effective.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Better robustness to affine transformation and overlapping image detection are some of the benefits associated with CapsNets.

In addition, CapsNets’ training and testing are slow and resource hungry. In this chapter, we propose two methods to reduce PCs to make CapsNet resource-efficient.

We further compress this network by optimizing the feature extraction and introduce LE-CapsNet-T as a tiny variant of the network. Using 3.8M weights, LE-CapsNet obtains 77.21% accuracy for the CIFAR-10 dataset while performing inference 4x faster. In our second approach, we investigate the possibility of pruning PCs in CapsNet.

In this study, different from existing strategies to alleviate the data imbalance issue, a novel mechanism based on the CutMix regularization technique is proposed for imbalanced image classification. The novelty is from two aspects. First, a novel sampling strategy is proposed to create the synthetic training data with a more balanced distribution. Second, labels of synthetic images were assigned with a bias toward minority classes. With the novel sampling and label assignment, more synthetic images of minority classes can be obtained to balance the class distribution of training data. Experiments on three benchmark datasets justified that the proposed method consistently outperforms commonly used strategies to alleviate the class imbalance issue.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits, the interconnect wires are connected to each other to form thousands of signal nets. It may be challenging to handle large VLSI interconnect structures with the FRW method. In this chapter, we present the basics of FRW method for the capacitance extraction problem, along with two techniques addressing the challenges with large VLSI interconnect nets. One is a virtual Gaussian surface sampling technique. It makes efficient random sampling on the Gaussian surface for complex nets with vias, and optimizes the sampling scheme to reduce the time of random walk. The other is a parallelized, improved construction approach for Octree based space management structure. It can bring more than 5000X speedup and provides same convenience to the FRW procedure. Numerical experiments on large cases with up to about half million conductors validate the presented techniques, and demonstrate a fast FRW based capacitance solver for VLSI interconnect extraction tasks.","['Engineering', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation', 'Engineering Mathematics']"

A solar cell's output power may be determined by a number of factors, including its intensity, its temperature, and the radiation released by the cell. Solar power systems are effective in utilizing the sun's energy, but solar cells' conversion efficiency is very low. This results in a lower total efficiency. A result of this is that the MPPT algorithm is employed by solar PV systems to maximize their output power while being completely independent of the system's input power, temperature, and irradiation conditions, as well as the electrical characteristics of its load. In this research, the boost converter is utilized to regulate the power produced by PV via the use of the MPPT control mechanism, which is detailed in further depth further down this section. The performance of the PV module is evaluated with the help of the SIMULINK application. According to the results of the simulation, the suggested hybrid MPPT control would result in greater efficiency when compared to the standard MPPT control system.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

Underwater image analysis plays a vital role, where the images are easily prone to attenuation and haziness. Capturing underwater images has always been a challenging job due to dispersion and scattering of light inside water on a high scale. Several image enhancement and restoration methodologies are currently available to address these issues, where hazing and color diffusion are viewed as a common phenomenon in it. Such procedures normally includes two basic methodologies in it, namely dehazing and contrast or color enhancement, which improves the overall output of the degraded image. However, the quality and processing time of the images can still be enhanced with additional techniques incorporated to it. This work is intended toward proposing one such channel called improvised bright channel prior for dehazing the underwater images. The technique further improves on the existing methodologies by estimating the atmospheric light and refining the transmittance of the image along with image restoration. The experimental results show that the improvised bright channel prior methodology is found to perform better in dehazing underwater images with a balanced intensity in terms of dark and white patches obtained from it. When comparing and contrasting the processing time of the proposed methodology with the existing techniques, it is found that improvised bright channel prior performs better. Also, the quality of the dehazed underwater image obtained from the proposed channel is found to be effective when compared with the existing channels.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Statistics, general', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Recent techniques are used to detect and monitoring the COVID-19–affected person’s lifestyle and insisting they take precaution steps for early pre-pandemic life. IoT is a framework that is used to generate data from the human body from the sensors opted for human conditions. Wearable devices have been created with these sensors and communicated with human bodies directly or indirectly. The generated data will send through the server using any connectivity techniques such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Analytics will be done at the server side for taking actions like the human body is affected by the COVID-19 virus or not. Finally, the generated data from a human can continuously store in real time in a cloud server which will be managed as a framework efficiently. This research work proposes a framework for data management in the early detection and monitoring of COVID-19 persons through IoT wearable devices in a pre-pandemic life. The experiments have been done at different zones, and the results are shown symptoms of COVID-19 disease. Parallel work reveals the data management in a cloud server since data have generated continuously in real time and tracking details also stored genuinely. Data management is the typical process in this research because all the data were generated in real time and analytics will be done whenever required. For that large amount of space and effective retrieval technique is required for data extraction. This research work data set is derived from various Internet sources like government web sites and mobile applications, and then, results have displayed the COVID-19 disease details accurately in real time.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security']"

Some of these are its simplicity, low cost, and high efficiency. Applying pulse-width modulation techniques to improve the performance of many types of inverters is under research. In this paper, distinct switching techniques generate the gate pulses for switches of the flyback inverter. The paper deals with the implementation and comparative analysis of three different models of flyback inverters: (1) open-loop flyback inverter with the pulse generator, (2) open-loop flyback inverter with pulse width modulation (PWM), and (3) open-loop flyback inverter with a sinusoidal pulse-width modulation (SPWM) technique. The output voltage and current signals are pure sinusoidal when the SPWM technique generates the gate pulses.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-11686-5_9,en,ModelVars2SPL: From UML Class Diagram Variants to Software Product Line Core Assets,OriginalPaper,"Software Product Line (SPL) is a reuse-oriented approach to create families of related system variants. SPLs are commonly adopted as a way to overcome problems emerged with the use of opportunistic reuse. In the existing literature of extractive adoption of SPLs, most of the studies only focus on source code, limiting engineers to reason about high-level architectural design decisions. Also, the vast majority of approaches are partially automated, or do not reflect domain constraints, such as feature interactions, and include or exclude relationships, which requires extensive human intervention and is error-prone. These limitations hamper a widely adoption of SPLs in industry. To tackle these limitations, in this chapter we present ModelVars2SPL ( Model Variants to SPL Core Assets ), an automated approach to aid the re-engineering of SPLs from existing system variants. ModelVars2SPL uses as input a set of Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams and the list of features they implement. The approach generates as output two SPL core assets: (1) Feature Model (FM), which represents the combinations of features, and (2) Product Line Architecture (PLA), which represents a global structure of the variants. ModelVars2SPL is composed of four automated steps. The approach was evaluated regarding the artifacts it generates and its performance. The results show that the FMs well-represent the features organization, providing useful information to define and manage commonalities and variabilities. The PLAs represent a global structure of current variants, facilitating the understanding of existing implementations of all variants. An advantage of ModelVars2SPL is to exploit the use of UML design models, being programming language agnostic. In addition, our approach supports the re-engineering process in the design level, allowing practitioners to have a broader view of the SPL.","['Computer Science', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Software Management', 'Computer System Implementation']"

However, how to efficiently apply brain dynamics for the recognition of brain states is still unclear and need more investigations. The spiking neural network (SNN) is a promising model with better performance in the pattern recognition of event streams. Thus, this paper proposes an algorithm framework for brain states recognition by fusing brain dynamics and SNN, where the brain dynamics are estimated as the dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) matrices. Through applying the DFC-SNN algorithm to the dataset of resting state electroencephalograph signals from healthy subjects and obsessive compulsive disorder patients, we observed that this algorithm was competent to perform the recognition of pathological brain states. It showed that the convergence of SNN model was rapid within less than 20 epochs, and the accuracy was 87.5% under optimal threshold of DFC matrices. In summary, this is the first attempting for the recognition of brain states via the aspect of brain dynamics. The algorithm framework would be beneficial for the applications of SNN model in the field of neuroscience.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Applications', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Mathematics of Computing']"

Biometric-based automatic authentication facilities are in demand to solve the security issues. Among all biometrics, fingerprint authentication is the most and widely accepted approach. Though several applications with a fingerprint are supporting the authentication but yet are not attaining confidence even though combined with some personal identification number. The single fingerprint image used for authentication can be obtained with modern techniques to break the security. In this paper, a novel method is presented by considering the fusion of five fingerprint images. Each fingerprint image is preprocessed individually and to improve the security performance, all the five fingerprint minutiae points are hashed and it is applied to decide the user authentication. The hashed-based vector is stored in the database. The approach preprocessing the images separately involves feature extraction. The last fingerprint image is only obtained for the security break but with our approach, it is not possible to break the security as it needs five fingerprints. The method certainly improves the level of security.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

This analysis, including trend analysis and control of hate posting, is required to moderate forums or even to eliminate spam, and only with the help of automation it is possible to efficiently process the enormous volume of information that is generated daily. An important application of this analysis is the detection of sexist bias in social networks, which can help to identify early behavior that could later lead to violent actions. However, there are various obstacles to the correct treatment of the messages and the detection of possible biases, among which the absence of context in the analysis of these messages and the use of tools and libraries focused on the English language stand out. In this article we study the issues associated with this automatic analysis, and we introduce the foundation of an analysis method for biases or prejudices in the messages retrieved from the Twitter network, considering the context, and using a mechanism to reduce dependencies with the analyzed language. A supervised classifier was developed whose objective is to be able to identify possible biases on any topic, taking into account context and minimizing the dependency on language. The method was tested in a case study for the detection of sexism, using idioms typical of the geographical area analyzed. In the experiments carried out, an accuracy of 73% was obtained, which can be improved by expanding the training set.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The light intensity from the high beam is 1200 lumens which are comparatively higher than the light intensity from the low beam (700 lumens). For this circumstance, the headlight should be dimmed to avoid road accidents. To avoid such incidents, the automatic headlight dimmer circuit can be used. This circuit consists of light-dependent resistor (LDR) sensors and a night vision camera to sense the light from the approaching vehicle that comes in opposite direction. Then, the light signals are processed using an Arduino microcontroller and the output signals are given to the switching relays. Hence, it switches automatically from the high beam into the low beam and reduces the glare effect faced by the drivers coming from the approaching vehicle.

A more and more popular solution to this problem consists in applying obfuscating techniques, in particular at the source code level. Informally, the goal of obfuscation is to conceal the purpose of a program or its logic without altering its functionality, thus preventing reverse-engineering on the program even with the help of computing resources. This allows to protect software against plagiarism, tampering, or finding vulnerabilities that could be used for different kinds of attacks. The many advantages of code obfuscation, together with its low cost, makes it a popular technique. This paper proposes a novel methodology for source code obfuscation relying on the reference LLVM compiler infrastructure that can be used together with other traditional obfuscation techniques, making the code more robust against reverse engineering attacks. The problem is defined as a Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization (MOCO) problem, where the goal is to find sequences of LLVM optimizations that lead to highly obfuscated versions of the original code. These transformations are applied to the back-end pseudo-assembly code ( i.e. , LLVM Intermediate Representation), thus avoiding any further optimizations by the compiler. Three different problem flavours are defined and solved with popular NSGA-II genetic algorithm. The promising results show the potential of the proposed technique.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Education, general']"

This makes learning the basic concepts of programming difficult for some of the students, who must dedicate their time to two global tasks: developing the ability to propose solutions to computer problems and learning to use a programming language to be able to represent said solutions. Students who have more difficulty tackling both tasks should focus on the first, since the second task is useless if the student does not know how to propose solutions to the problems.

It can be costly and difficult to detect, traditionally requiring hours of assessment by a trained clinical. Recently, machine learning models have been trained to screen for depression with patient voice recordings collected during an interview with a virtual agent. To engage the patient in a conversation and increase the quantity of responses, the virtual interviewer asks a series of follow-up questions. However, asking fewer questions would reduce the time burden of screening for the participant. We, therefore, assess if these follow-up questions have a tangible impact on the performance of deep learning models for depression classification. Specifically, we study the effect of including the vocal and transcribed replies to one, two, three, four, five, or all follow-up questions in the depression screening models. We notably achieve this using unimodal and multimodal pre-trained transfer learning models. Our findings reveal that follow-up questions can help increase F1 scores for the majority of the interview questions. This research can be leveraged for the design of future mental illness screening applications by providing important information about both question selection and the best number of follow-up questions.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Mathematical Models of Cognitive Processes and Neural Networks']"

Model fitting can be hindered by several issues, including computational inefficiency, bad initialization, excessive modeled noise, sensitivity to over-factoring and collinearity. Many algorithms have been proposed for parameter estimation, each with specific strengths and weaknesses. Fast procedures tend to be less stable and vice-versa. Stability is usually prioritized by preferring the least-square approach ALS, albeit slow and sensitive to excess factors. As a solution integrated methods have been proposed in the literature. First, estimation is initialized with a fast procedure to ensure competitive speed then results are refined with ALS to improve precision.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-20650-4_11,en,Transformer-Encoder Generated Context-Aware Embeddings for Spell Correction,OriginalPaper,"In this paper, we propose a novel approach for context-aware spell correction in text documents. We present a deep learning model that learns a context-aware character-level mapping of words to a compact embedding space. In the embedding space, a word and its spelling variations are mapped close to each other in a Euclidean space. After we develop this mapping for all words in the dataset’s vocabulary, it is possible to identify and correct wrongly spelt words by comparing the distances of their mappings with those of the correctly spelt words. The word embeddings are built in a way that captures the context of each word. This makes it easier for our system to identify correctly spelt words that are used out of their contexts (e.g., their/there, your/you’re). The Euclidean distance, between our word embeddings, can thus be deemed as a context-aware string similarity metric. We employ a transformer-encoder model that takes character-level input of words and their context to achieve this. The embeddings are generated as the outputs of the model. The model is then trained to minimize triplet loss, which ensures that spell variants of a word are embedded close to the word, and that unrelated words are embedded farther away. We further improve the efficiency of the training by using a hard triplet mining approach. Our approach was inspired by FaceNet [ 18 ], where the authors developed a similar approach for face recognition and clustering using embeddings generated from Convolutional Neural Networks. The results of our experiments show that our approach is effective in spell check applications.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computers and Education', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.

It is critical to understand mechanical characteristics for safety concerns. In the case of concrete, the compressive strength is the most significant mechanical property to explore. It has been critical to anticipate the compressive strength of concrete using artificial intelligence. The main focus of this study is to present an “optimized model”, which is capable to accurately predict the CS of concrete with varied ingredient levels at different ages ranging from 1 to 365 days by using ANN technique optimized with particle Swarm Optimization. A total of 1030 data sets were extracted from the UC Irvine ML repository, with eight input parameters. Age (in days), fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, superplasticizer, water, fly ash, blast furnace slag, and cement have been used to estimate the compressive strength of concrete as an output. The experimental data is then validated using R, $$R^2$$ , MSE, RMSE and MAPE. In comparison, the optimized PSO-ANN method has a high R value of 0.96, whereas the R value for the ANN algorithm is 0.94. With more precise compressive strength data, this prediction model helps to decrease laboratory experimental effort, as well as time and expense.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Management']"

Extracting emotional content from voice signals enhances the communication between humans and machines. Despite the rapid advancement of Speech Emotion Recognition systems for several languages, there is still a gap in SER research for the Arabic language. The goal of this research is to build an Arabic-based SER system using a feature set that has both high performance and low computational cost. Two novel feature sets were created using a mix of spectral and prosodic features, which were evaluated on the Arabic corpus (EYASE) constructed from a drama series. EYASE is the Egyptian Arabic Semi-natural Emotion speech dataset that consists of 579 utterances representing happy, sad, angry, and neutral emotions, uttered by 3 male and 3 female professional actors. To verify the emotions’ recognition results, surveys were conducted by Arabic and non-Arabic speakers to analyze the dataset constituents. The survey results show that recognition of anger, sadness, and happiness are sometimes misclassified as neutral. Machine learning classifiers Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Ensemble learning were applied. For valence (happy/angry) emotions classification, Ensemble learning showed best results of 87.59% using the 2 proposed feature sets. Featureset-2 had the highest recognition accuracy with all classifiers. For multi-emotions classification, Support Vector Machine had the highest recognition accuracy of 64% using featureset-2 and benchmarked Interspeech feature sets. The computational cost of featureset-2 was the lowest for all classifiers, either for training or testing.","['Computer Science', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Computer Communication Networks', 'Database Management', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.

Out of which, identification of post-COVID-19 impact on brain took more time to understand the exact way the virus is affecting because psychological behavior is the first symptom and that takes keen observation to suggest the possibility of neurological infections. But, by that time, the illness reaches to more serious complications. Also, post-vaccination evidence shows that the blood clot formations becoming a new challenge for brain tumor patients. The blood clots in nervous systems are so tiny that by MRI/CT, it is not possible to differentiate between cerebral fluids. Hence, it becomes necessary to operate patient immediately with a clear vision facility for blood clots. Hence, this paper suggests the new deep learning algorithm which can be a great solution for image analysis with high level of accuracy. The proposed deep CNN module further can be used as a software package for needle camera for robotic assisted surgery which in turn saves time for image analysis and direct location of tumor can be identified during live camera surgery.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']"

Despite that, the problem of illumination variation has not yet been completely resolved. This paper proposed an illumination-robust face recognition approach based on four blocks of the pre-trained VGG16 followed by an Average Polling layer. After extracting features, our approach used PCA to reduce dimensionality and LinearSVC in the classification task. Our approach has been evaluated on the Extended Yale B and the AR databases collected under illumination variation. Compared with some popular Deep CNN models trained from scratch and with Transfer Learning on both databases, our proposed approach proved its robustness and effectiveness against variation and poor illumination. The proposed approach has achieved an average accuracy of 99.32% and 99.79% on the Extended Yale B and AR databases, respectively. The accuracies mentioned above surpassed the state-of-the-art in the face recognition field on both databases.","['Engineering', 'Complexity', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control and Systems Theory']"

Computing with Words (CW) is a mathematical model for approximate knowledge representation, reasoning, and processing of natural language. The very basic idea of CW is to use words instead of numbers for computing and reasoning using fuzzy sets and logic. However, the implementation of this approach in the project requires certain knowledge. This paper presents our initial efforts towards building of a methodology and library based on the extended version of CW, CWiPy. CWiPy can be effectively used to apply CW techniques easily without any prior knowledge in this field. So, developers can add it to an existing system and use it as a black box (plug and play). In CWiPy, the traditional CW was extended to process a bigger variety of linguistic hedges, enhancing the system expressiveness. CWiPy provides an API that allows handling of fuzzy variables, sets, hedges, and quantifiers. Results show that CWiPY can be easily applied in real-life industrial applications to deal with imprecise information and provide help for experts. Two different usage scenarios of the library are presented as a proof of concept: natural language query processing and database summarization .","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It is important to understand nature of expression, and then, its interpretation ways can be defined. For example, “on the same day,” it requires information about previous sentences in the text to define reference time rather than considering document creation time as reference time statically. In this paper, a normalization system is proposed that dynamically chose the reference time from text rather than relying on traditional approach of selecting a document creation date as reference time.

In this work, a framework is proposed for detecting road speed anomalies, taking as reference the driving vehicle. The objective is to warn the driver in real-time that a vehicle is overtaking dangerously to prevent a possible accident. Thus, taking the information captured by the rear camera integrated into the vehicle, the system will automatically determine if the overtaking that other vehicles make is considered abnormal or dangerous or is considered normal. Deep learning-based object detection techniques will be used to detect the vehicles in the road image. Each detected vehicle will be tracked over time, and its trajectory will be analyzed to determine the approach speed. Finally, statistical regression techniques will estimate the degree of anomaly or hazard of said overtaking as a preventive measure.

To compensate for these impairments at the receiver, the complexity of the digital signal processing algorithms must be reduced. Deep learning-based equalizers have shown to be promising in this area. However, their efficient implementation in practical systems is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity convolutional recurrent neural network (CNN+RNN) for deep learning of Kerr nonlinearity effects in long-haul optical fiber channels governed by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. This approach reduces computational complexity by balancing the computational load via capturing short-range temporal features using multi-channel strided convolution layers with ReLU activation, and the long-range temporal features using a unidirectional vanilla recurrent layer. We demonstrate that for a 16-QAM 64 GBd optical transmission system over 1120 km of standard single-mode fiber with 14 spans, the proposed model approaches the performance of digital backpropagation and achieves superior or comparable performance to recently-proposed MLP, CNN+MLP, bi-RNN, bi-GRU, bi-LSTM, and CNN+bi-LSTM-based equalizers in the literature, with substantially fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs) than these models.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Mathematical Models of Cognitive Processes and Neural Networks']"

The correct substantiation of the portfolio framework contracts concluded between producers, suppliers, and energy consumers is an essential condition from a financial point of view regarding transactions. They must provide a benefit to the producers, within reasonable limits, so that the consumer price is not artificially increased.

We propose a Team Design Pattern that utilizes adaptivity in the behavior of human and agent team partners, causing new Collaboration Patterns to emerge. Human-AI Co-Learning takes place when partners can formalize recognized patterns of collaboration in a commonly shared language, and can communicate with each other about these patterns. For this, we developed an ontology of Collaboration Patterns. An accompanying Graphical User Interface (GUI) enables partners to formalize and refine Collaboration Patterns, which can then be communicated to the partner. The ontology was evaluated empirically with human participants who viewed video recordings of joint human-agent activities. Participants were requested to identify Collaboration Patterns in the footage, and to formalize patterns by using the ontology’s GUI. Results show that the ontology supports humans to recognize and define Collaboration Patterns successfully. To improve the ontology, it is suggested to include pre- and post-conditions of tasks, as well as parallel actions of team members.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Grievously, with the increasing availability of high-dimensional datasets, their direct applicability is put at stake: GMMs suffer from the curse of dimensionality issue, as the number of parameters grows quadratically with the number of variables. To this extent, a methodological link between Gaussian mixtures and Gaussian graphical models has recently been established in order to provide a framework for performing penalized model-based clustering in presence of large precision matrices. Notwithstanding, current methodologies do not account for the fact that groups may be under or over-connected, thus implicitly assuming similar levels of sparsity across clusters. We overcome this limitation by defining data-driven and component specific penalty factors, automatically accounting for different degrees of connections within groups. A real data experiment on handwritten digits recognition showcases the validity of our proposal.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Still, it is responsible for significant levels of morbidity in many regions of the world, with about 12 million cases annually, and about 600,000 fatalities. Diagnosis of typhoid poses a lot of challenges because its clinical presentation is confused with those of many other febrile infections such as malaria, yellow fever, etc. In addition, most developing countries do not have adequate bacteriology laboratories for further investigations. Decision support systems (DSSs) have been known to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the diagnosis process, in addition to improving access; however, most existing decision support models for the diagnosis of diseases have largely focused on ‘non-tropical’ conditions. An effective decision support model for the diagnosis of tropical diseases can only be developed through the engineering of experiential knowledge of physicians who are experts in the management of such conditions. In this study, we mined the experiential knowledge of twenty-five tropical disease specialist physicians to develop a decision support system based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The resulting model was tested based on 2044 patient data. Our model successfully determined the occurrence (or otherwise) of typhoid fever in 78.91% of the cases, demonstrating the utility of AHP in the diagnosis of typhoid fever.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Because of this reason, an equivalence test based on those measures is proposed for this kind of data. The spirit is to incorporate little or irrelevant deviations between the observed data and the target population in the definition of the hypothesis to be tested. Such deviations can be measured by means of a $$\phi $$ ϕ -divergence measure, which in turn can be consistently estimated. An equivalence test based on that estimator is presented. The asymptotic behavior of the test statistic is studied and a critical region based on the asymptotic null distribution is considered. To study the finite sample performance of the proposal and to compare it with existing tests, several simulation experiments were carried out.

The efficiency of COVID-19 diagnosis has become highly significant. As deep learning and convolutional neural network (CNN) has been widely utilized and been verified in analyzing medical images, it has become a powerful tool for computer-assisted diagnosis. However, there are two most significant challenges in medical image classification with the help of deep learning and neural networks, one of them is the difficulty of acquiring enough samples, which may lead to model overfitting. Privacy concerns mainly bring the other challenge since medical-related records are often deemed patients’ private information and protected by laws such as GDPR and HIPPA. Federated learning can ensure the model training is decentralized on different devices and no data is shared among them, which guarantees privacy. However, with data located on different devices, the accessible data of each device could be limited. Since transfer learning has been verified in dealing with limited data with good performance, therefore, in this paper, We made a trial to implement federated learning and transfer learning techniques using CNNs to classify COVID-19 using lung CT scans. We also explored the impact of dataset distribution at the client-side in federated learning and the number of training epochs a model is trained.

The model that we propose aims to authenticate documents through the use of blockchain technology, non-fungible tokens, and interplanetary file system. When a document is stored on the blockchain, a non-fungible token is created, which contains the unique address of the issuing institution and the hash of the document itself. The ownership of this token is then transferred to the document holder by the corresponding issuing authority. In this way, when someone wants to verify the authenticity of the document, they can use the address mentioned in the token to trace back the creator. If the document’s hash differs from the one stored in the token, we know that the document has been altered. Even when unauthorized users are successful in adding the forged documents to the blockchain, they will not have the same unique signature as that of the authorized institution.

However, studies on the implementation of social media marketing by companies are limited. This paper aims to explore the internal organization of businesses in Mauritius to use social media as a strategic marketing tool. A qualitative research design has been developed to gather data from Chief Communication Officers and Chief Marketing Officers of major conglomerates in Mauritius. Semi-structured interviews were conducted. This study shows that conglomerates either manage their social media marketing in-house or they hire an agency to manage their social media accounts. To guide behaviors of employees, all conglomerates have developed a social media policy. Social media marketing requires specific skills and competencies and has given rise to new job descriptions. This study adds to the body of knowledge of social media marketing by providing insights about the approaches conglomerates have adopted to leverage social media.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Statistics, general', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

If PLA documentation is missing, it can be recovered by reverse engineering the products. The recovered PLA is a relevant asset for developers and architects, that can be used to drive specific activities of SPL development and evolution, such as, understanding its structure and its variation points, and assessing reuse. This chapter presents our PLA recovery approach and an exploratory study that investigated the effectiveness of recovered PLAs to address variability identification and support reuse assessment. We recovered the PLA of 15 open source SPL projects using the PLAR, a tool that supports PLA recovery and assessment based on information extracted from SPL products’ source code. For each project, reuse assessment was supported by existing reuse metrics. The yielded results revealed that the number of products used in PLA recovery affected the variability identification, and the number of optional features affected the components reuse rate. The findings suggest that a minimum set of representative products should be identified and selected for PLA recovery, and the component reuse rate is a candidate metric for SPL reuse assessment.","['Computer Science', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Software Management', 'Computer System Implementation']"

The X-beam intensity decides the nature of CT images, if the X-beam portion is higher, the nature of CT picture is improved yet it might create bad effect on the patients. Low portion CT pictures are noisy because of some significant reasons, for example, measurable vulnerability in all physical estimations. The major problem arises that if we lower the CT dose the quality of our image deteriorates and if we increase the dosage the risk on the patient increases. Thus in this paper, a technique is proposed in which bilateral filter and shearlet-based thresholding are used. For better edge safeguarding, we have used the concept of method noise thresholding. From different output metrics such as PSNR, IQI, the accuracy of the resulting CT images is checked and evaluated. The findings are also contrasted with the related state of the art and some recent works as well. After review of the findings, it is noted that our proposed algorithm is better compared to existing algorithms.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In addition to the classic transport function, through new technologies (V2V, V2G), an electric vehicle can be successfully transformed into an active tool in achieving the goals of a Smart City. This paper presents several alternatives both as an effective part of control hardware for an electric vehicle and algorithms implemented on this hardware. The special characteristics that can be implemented in an electric vehicle are highlighted by presenting the achievements of such vehicles. The original note is the conversion of a vintage off-road vehicle from Romania into an electric vehicle. It is noteworthy that many of the hardware components used in the construction of various electric vehicles are recycled so it can be said that the first step in terms of the concept of sustainable development has already been achieved. All electric vehicles designed or converted at the University of Petrosani benefit from LoRa type communications (a communication network still little used in Romania but which has proven its reliability) and are intended for use inside an urban area and can successfully fulfil the role of the platform for monitoring the air quality parameters in a certain area precisely in view of the fact that it does not pollute directly.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Computational Intelligence']"

The development of the computer processing power, as well as the quality of image capture equipment, has increased the accessibility of larger and more accurate data sets. This permanently improves the performance of the developed programs. Convolutional neural networks are the starting point for identifying facial analysis and gesture recognition. By their nature, they can recognize ideal Spatio-temporal features for RGB image processing. The proposed model with 3D Kernel is useful in certain situations where the gestures are very different from each other and must be recognized by a system that reacts quickly and with high processing speed (emergencies or critical situations). The main objective of this paper is to build a reliable and easy-to-implement human gesture recognition classifier. It must be able to easily classify a large number of images so that it can operate in real-time, processing at least 30 frames per second. This is possible by using other hardware components of a shelf computer connected to a normal CCTV-Closed Circuit TV infrastructure. The selection of the gesture class must be not related to the environment, person, background, appearance, or viewing angle.

This paper presents an architecture that combines the power of Siamese Triplet CNN and a fully-connected neural network for binary classification to automatically verify genuine and forgery signatures even if the forged signature is highly skilled. On the challenging public dataset for signature verification BHSig260, the proposed model can achieve a low False Acceptance Rate = 13.66, which is slightly better than the reference model.

Several more studies, which are discussed later in this paper, have shown that a data centre's infrastructure must be audited in order to be secure. Third-party auditors will be hired by the data centres to verify the infrastructure, or more specifically, the virtual machines, during the auditing process. VMs, programmes, and data may be accessed by these auditors. A drawback of this auditing procedure is that the auditors may explicitly access any areas of the VMs, where the VMs’ highly sensitive data is stored. It is difficult to allow access depending on the requests since this might increase the overall time required to conduct the audits. As a result, recent research calls for selective and adaptive auditing. Parallel researchers have proven a variety of ways to protect an auditing system. Although these results are more sophisticated in terms of both time and accuracy, they have been criticized for this. A unique prediction approach for analysing the features of the virtual machine applications and demand characteristics from auditors is proposed in this work, and eventually, the access to the virtual machine is granted using a predictive regression model. For making cloud-based application development safer and quicker, the suggested technique shows a 50% reduction in time complexity compared to existing parallel research results.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication']"

Recently, many good scientific research publications in the biomedical arena was released using the MEDLINE/PubMed dataset. In the fields of biomedical research and healthcare, assessing these enormous data sets and extracting valuable information is a critical but difficult endeavour. Here, we attempt to retrieve relevant data from openly accessible text materials, like medical reports, journals, articles, papers, and some other research works, in the medical area. hese types of text data undergo first preprocessing in this chapter using sentence tokenization, then stopword removal, stemming operations, and ultimately vectorization using the BioBERT model. Consequently, a structured data is generated to process each report in feature extraction process and then clustered the similar sentences by Fuzzy C-means clustering. Then, using multiple similarity clustering measures and a bi-objective strength measure, defuzzify the clusters and construct the base summaries. To construct the report summary, en ensemble summarising approach has been employed by using Pareto evolutionary algorithm. The method contains two optimization methods(or functions): one dependent on the produced summary size, which is constant, and the other dependent on the IG (i.e., information gain) of the considering base summaries, which is variable. When the process of evolution converges, the strongest chromosomal solution of the ultimate population offers a desired summary report.

For example, if the launch date of a new product has changed many times, the company might want to know to which people the most current information has reached. In the propagation model we consider, the social network is represented as a directed graph, and an agent (node) updates its state if it receives a stronger opinion (updated information) and then forwards the opinion in accordance with the direction of its edges. Previous work evaluated opinion propagation in a social network by using the probably approximately correct (PAC) learning framework and considered only binary opinions. In general, PAC learnability, i.e., the finiteness of the number of samples needed, is not guaranteed when generalizing from a binary-value model to a multi-value model. We show that the PAC learnability of multi-value opinions propagating in a social network. We first prove that the number of samples needed in a multi-opinion model is sufficient for $$(k-1)\log (k-1)$$ ( k - 1 ) log ( k - 1 ) times the number of samples needed in a binary-opinion model, when $$k~(\ge 3)$$ k ( ≥ 3 ) is the number of opinions.

However, because the best CNN architecture differs for different problems, the fixed-length encoding of particles in conventional PSO poses a significant problem for evolving CNN architectures, therefore a unique flexible encoding method is designed to overcome the fixed-length limitation, it is the most basic aspect of the work in this chapter.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-21203-1_41,en,Accounting for Strategic Response in Limit Order Book Dynamics,OriginalPaper,"The orders of traders in financial markets are typically stored in so-called limit order books. It is well understood that the mechanisms used to rank buy and sell orders affect the behavior of traders and ultimately market fundamentals. Research has focused on different design paradigms, alternative to the commonly used price-time priority, in the attempt to reduce volatility, maintain traded volumes and reduce toxic order flows. We here examine spread/price-time priority, introduced in [ 8 ], where the spread of two-sided orders contributes to the determination of the ranking. In contrast to previous simulation and numerical results, we account for the strategic response of traders. We consider different order aggression levels as pure strategies, and adopt a sound empirical game-theoretic analysis to analyze the market at equilibrium. Our results indicate that volatility is reduced by spread/price-time priority whereas the total trading volume is highly related to its spread weight: there is a sharp drop of trading volume when spread dominates the ranking over price. Our analysis shows that a $$70\%$$ 70 % ranking contribution of price and a $$30\%$$ 30 % ranking contribution of spread is a suitable setting that can lower the market volatility without decreasing trading volume. Our study confirms that spread/price-time priority is beneficial to financial markets, even when trader incentives are considered, while clarifying that its parameters need to be appropriately set.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

A graph convolutional network (GCN) was used to turn the graphs into embedding vectors, which represent tendency of their structure. In the loss function used for training, we used Simpson coefficient to measure the overlapping of graphs. The degree of inclusion was measured as cosine similarity of the obtained vectors. To evaluate the method, we used card images of competitive Karuta. The adjacency of letters on the card was represented as a graph, and lack of recognized letters under the realistic environment such as under sunlight or shadow gives a subgraph of the graph for the card. We used our model to identify card with the subgraph, and found our method achieved over 90% of accuracy in this setting.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-07654-1_5,en,Data Hiding in Binary Images for Secret and Secure Communication Using Decision Tree,OriginalPaper,"In today’s digital era, secret communication through digital media has become difficult due to advances in technology. Many methods are used to maintain secrecy like password protection, cryptography, etc. The drawback of applying these techniques is that it alerts about the presence of secret information within media. So information hiding in the multimedia medium is the most powerful mean for secret communication. Binary images are frequently transferred and so can be utilized as a carrier for hiding secret information. But hiding in binary images is challenging as changes caused due to hiding are very easily noticeable and hence limit hiding capacity. Image distortion, information hiding capacity, security, and imperceptibility are the common factors to evaluate the performance of any data hiding techniques. In existing techniques, either the data hiding capacity or visual distortion has been taken care of. This paper proposes a novel approach for hiding data in binary images which focuses on minimization in visual distortion providing good data hiding capacity and security to hidden data. To achieve this, the original image pattern is utilized in the best possible way and the message is hidden distributing over the image in the encrypted form. In this technique, the image and secret message are divided into parts where image partitions are further divided into 3 × 3 pixel blocks. These image partitions and secret message parts are provided to the decision tree for deciding the best suitable image partition for hiding secret message parts. The decision tree takes decisions based on the type of match of LRUD pattern of 3 × 3 pixel block and the message part pattern to be hidden. The receiver can retrieve the data without the original image with the help of indicator blocks which are prepared at the time of embedding. The results show that the proposed approach provides good hiding capacity minimizing distortion caused due to data hiding.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Computer Communication Networks', 'Computational Intelligence']"

The cloud-ERP systems provide many opportunities to organizations. On the other hand, barriers, and challenges to this move still exist. This research provides an overview of relevant academic literature on public cloud-ERP migration and identifies the status quo for the body of knowledge within cloud-ERPs delivered through software-as-a-service (SaaS). In addition, this paper explores the motivators and inhibitors, and if cloud-ERP provides the ability to enhance organizational performance from an IT perspective. The study is motivated by a gap in research in investigating if cloud-ERP systems’ characteristics encourage or hinder enterprises from migrating to the public cloud. Cloud-ERPs delivered in SaaS models are distributed as a service over the Internet, usually through a public cloud infrastructure with shared resources. SaaS enables organizations to pay for services and functions they use and removes the need to maintain the complex information technology infrastructure by client organizations. The cloud-ERP-system’s characteristics found in the literature are organized, and presented based on DeLone, and McLean’s IS success model dimensions, and the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework. Our main findings suggest that cloud-ERP’s system and service quality are the most discussed issues in the literature. The system quality attributes of cloud-ERPs identified are scalability, availability, accessibility, reliability, and the ability to compose and customize web services, motivating organizations to adopt cloud-based ERP. On the other hand, service quality attributes are found as inhibitors for moving to the cloud due to the organization´s dependency on vendors´ support and service throughout the product lifecycle, and the security risks related to the public cloud environment.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Continuous tracking of GNSS carrier phase signals provides high-precision PPP solutions. PPP requires ionospheric research, which geostationary satellites can help with. The NavIC system, which includes three geostationary satellites in orbit, can fulfill this need. Pre-processing of data before positioning and identification and correction of cycle-slip error are the two methods investigated in this study that provides more efficient PPP.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']"

Initially, we have prepared an ideal set of word-based digit pronunciations of 15 digits for the said dialect. The standard approach was used to collect speech data in an open room using Zoom H4N handy portable digital recorder from native language speakers of diverse age groups and gender. Each spoken isolated data has been processed and segmented using a WaveSurfer software tool. Sampling frequency was set at 16 kHz and bit resolution at 16 bits per sample. We extracted the relevant speech feature vectors using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) and perceptual linear prediction (PLP) that are compatible with the hybrid acoustic models of conventional (Gaussian mixture model-hidden Markov model)-based models (monophone and triphone) and hidden Markov model-deep neural network (HMM-DNN). Using MFCC and PLP features, we found that the HMM-DNN model performs better than GMM-HMM-based models with a word error rate (WER) of 6.67% and 7.40%, respectively.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics']"

Das, Subhraneil Prasad, Keerthana Human blood is a very effective parameter to detect, diagnose and rectify ailments of the human body. Complete blood count (CBC) is a method to clinically obtain a statistical measure of blood and its related parameters, i.e., red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), platelets, hemoglobin concentration to name a few. This helps to determine the physical state of the subject. For further diagnosis, peripheral blood smear, a thin layer of blood smeared on a microscope slide and stained using various staining methods is examined for the morphology of the cells by the pathologists. However, manual inspection of smear images is tedious, time-consuming, and laboratorian-dependent. Although there are certain software-based approaches to tackle the problem, most of them are not robust for all staining methods. Thus, the need is to create an automated algorithm that will work for different staining types, thereby alleviating both the aforementioned drawbacks. This work aims to create an automatic method of segmenting and counting RBCs from blood smear images using image processing techniques to help diagnose RBC-related disorders. In the proposed method, the images are first preprocessed, i.e., standardized to a uniform color and illumination profile using contrast enhancement, adaptive histogram equalization followed by Reinhard stain normalization algorithms. WBCs and platelets are extracted in HSI color space and subtracted from the original image to retain only RBCs. Thereafter using morphological operations and active contour segmentation algorithms, a count of total RBCs were obtained even for overlapped cells in the microscopic blood smear image. The proposed method achieved counting accuracy of 89.6% for 150 images.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

This paper proposes a monitoring data storage scheme based on the alliance chain to further realize the intelligent management of the integrated pipe corridor. In this paper, the data storage federated chain model is constructed by using various monitoring hosts of the integrated pipeline corridor as pre-selected nodes of the federated chain. In addition, the paper also adopts a dual-chain storage model with “on-chain” storage of key data information and “off-chain” storage of complete monitoring data to avoid the problem of communication jams among nodes caused by too much data on the federated chain. Finally, the proposed storage scheme is analyzed and discussed in terms of security performance, and the advantages of the model are demonstrated. The storage scheme proposed in this paper can safely and reliably store the monitoring data in the integrated pipe corridor, which provides a theoretical reference for further construction of an intelligent platform for integrated pipe corridor management, and to a certain extent promotes the development of intelligent management of integrated pipe corridors.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Computational Intelligence']"

Recent solutions approach these difficulties in different ways. Some models do not constrain their inputs and operate with a large variety of sentences, but tend to be less accurate. Others limit the space of possible inputs, requiring them to meet a fixed structure which makes them more similar to code than language. This paper offers a middle ground between these approaches. We train a transition-based neural network on descriptions of programming tasks generated by using context-free grammar and templates.

It extends the FRW method to extract the capacitances of structures with encrypted substructures. Then, we reveal that the macromodel-aware random walk scheme is also useful for handling structures with complex geometry or repeated layout patterns. To reduce the error caused by the violation of macromodel’s properties, a finite different method (FDM) based technique is finally presented for generating the macromodels.

In the case of dying nodes, battery discharge may cause the network to get disconnected. WSN design issues, e.g., location of sensor nodes, scheduling activities, routes of data flow, mobile sink route, should be dealt with keeping energy limitation in mind. The sensor nodes sense the data from the area of concern and communicate the same to the sink for processing. Sensor nodes deployed in various application areas have limited memory, computational power, and battery backup. There is no defined topology of such network and frequently changing environment, very less amount of battery, and limited storage capability of the nodes. It is essential that each node in the network has knowledge about the routing path to the sink which is energy efficient. Since random placement of the nodes restrains coders from presuming routing table data at the sensor nodes, numerous methods have been suggested to create a dynamic path up to sink. Numerous researches are performed for WSN using the mobile sink. Most of the research activities focused on energy conservation in the background while proposing approaches for clustering, data flow paths, trajectory design, etc. In the WSN with a mobile sink, the trajectory of the sink node plays a vital role. Designing of trajectory is an NP-hard problem. With the use of nature-inspired techniques, e.g., particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), etc., can be used for generating a nearly optimal paths for the mobile sink.

This urges the need for a context-aware, automatic classification of text documents into standard scientific categories. Document classification is a significant application of supervised learning which requires a labeled dataset for training the classifier. However, research publication records available on Google Scholar and dblp services are not labeled. First, manual annotation of a large body of scientific research work based on standard scientific terminology requires domain expertise and is extremely time-consuming. Second, hierarchical labeling of records facilitates a more effective and context-aware retrieval of documents. In this paper, we propose an ontology-driven classification technique based on zero-shot learning in conjunction with agglomerative clustering to automatically label a scientific literature dataset related to CE and CS. We further study and compare the effectiveness of multiple text classifiers such as logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), gradient boosting with Word2vec and bag of words (BOW) embedding, recurrent neural networks (RNN) with GloVe embedding, and feed-forward neural networks with BOW embedding.

Hyperspectral image (HSI) is produced by each pixel of vector which is used to identify the unique materials of objects. Due to becoming large spectral bands, the classification of image is a more arduous task. To confront a problem, filtering techniques have become a hot research topic. The filtering techniques are employed for improving the HSI classification. This work discusses spatial feature extraction by using Domain Transform Interpolated Convolution Filter (DTICF). There are three steps for the proposed techniques: First, the spatial features are obtained by using DTICF. Second, those obtained spatial in the first processing and spectral bands of HSI are provided to design 3-Dimensional-Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) with and Bi-directional-Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) framework. In the third step, the obtained probabilistic classification map of 3D-CNN- Bi-LSTM is smoothed by Markov Random Field (MRF) efficiently. Based on the experimental results, two different hyperspectral images prove that DTICF-3D-CNN-Bi-LSTM approach is more important and provides good classification results compared to other classification approaches.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

These unseen words are called out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and involve: 1) regular Lithuanian words appearing due to different topics or domains not covered in training; 2) complicated cases, i.e., foreign names, brand names, and loanwords pronounced not according to regular Lithuanian pronunciation rules. In weighted finite-state transducer (WFST) ASR OOV problem is typically solved by applying one of the following solutions: (1) making ASR vocabulary unlimited by performing recognition on sub-word level, (2) adding words directly to the WFST decoding graph or (3) by reconstruction of OOV words from ASR result. Our baseline Lithuanian ASR system already follows the first approach, however many OOV words are still not being recognized, because of low probability of corresponding sub-word sequences. Therefore, our offered approach can be seen as a combination of the first two solutions: we boost probabilities of sequences of sub-words (corresponding to words being “added” to vocabulary) in a sub-word weighted finite-state transducer (WFST) ASR system. In such way the vocabulary of the ASR is being “expanded”. The proposed approach allowed to achieve significant improvement over the baseline: the percentage of misrecognized out-of-vocabulary words dropped by $$\sim $$ ∼ 7%, while F1 reached 85.6%.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Application to Dissimilarities Based on Divergences,OriginalPaper,"Time series classification has shown to be a very successful strategy for determining structures in temporal data. In addition, the combined use of cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling has proven to be an advisable strategy which leads to better understanding of the data than can be learned from each separately. One of the most popular partitioning algorithms is K-means clustering, whose main drawback for its application in time series is generally related to the lack of precision in the centroid of the cluster to capture the shape of the series, partly derived of the data dependence structure. In this paper we propose the combined use of cluster-mds in time series that aims at partitioning the time series into clusters while simultaneously the cluster centres are represented in a space of low dimension. The combined procedure, which does not require estimation of time series centroids, is illustrated by analyzing dissimilarity measures based on divergence for synthetic data sets.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Data Engineering', 'Statistics for Engineering, Physics, Computer Science, Chemistry and Earth Sciences', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Mathematical Applications in Computer Science']"

This predisposition is quite apparent in everyday life: different people respond differently to the same visual information. The careful utilization of this phenomenon can be extremely utilitarian. This is apparent from the recent widespread acknowledgment of visual bias, and its manipulation to bring about salutary business effects. Today, visual bias utilization can be seen at play in a number of different industries ranging from advertisements to recommendation systems of OTT giants. Despite the fact that the existence of visual bias is now widely accepted, few empirical studies have been conducted to confirm the same. The present article and the ensuing research serve to bridge that gap. In our article, we elucidate the salient points of the research. We conducted using movie posters as a means of estimating and studying the effects of visual bias. We built a Web application to survey and collect user ratings for movie posters belonging to different genres and thus having different visual effects. Based on the user’s input, a bias mapping was done, and the result of which was the genre that the user was most visually partial to. Contingent on that, neural style transformation was applied to movie posters, and the augmented results were presented to the user to rate. By comparing the initial genre-wise ratings to the transformed genre ratings, the extent of visual bias was detected and thus analyzed. Our study not only confirmed the empirical existence of such bias, but the detection methodology outlined here may serve as a visual bias manipulation tool that can utilize real-time machine learning to optimize AdSense and the likes.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']"

We have observed that regression models often give a low accuracy as compared to other techniques. We have evaluated the regression technique and draw a conclusion that these standard errors are the reason for the lower accuracy. The main reason of producing low accuracy is dependency on single-equation denoting relation between the dependent and independent variables. In regression model, on the basis of least square method, the affect of one variable is studied on other variable. However, there comes a time oftenly where the affect of one variable on another drastically changes due to the type of values or range of values present in the data. Such changes in the values might increase the higher accuracy of regression model. So, highly accurate regression model might not work for datasets with such variations. In this paper, we have discussed the issue of single-equation dependency to improve the accuracy. By using the ridge regression technique, we have developed a model that can produce high accuracy for multiple datasets with different variants in the values and the ranges of the values.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

This new era of marketing has seen customers to be more participative, more curious of something that is new and different, and businesses are focusing on machine learning (ML) to understand customer’s psychology. Traditionally, marketing was considered to be the synthesis of the four main elements of the marketing mix to satisfy customer needs, and there was a one-way communication: business to consumers (B2C).

It also enables the classification of the computational problems based on their algorithmic complexity, as defined according to the way the resources are required for the solution of the problem, including the execution time and scale with the problem size. Based on a novel mathematical informed framework and multi-staged integrative method concerning algorithmic complexity, this study aims at establishing a robust and accurate model reliant on the combination of fractional-order derivative and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the diagnostic and differentiability predictive purposes for the disease, (diabetes, as a metabolic disorder, in our case) which may display various and transient biological properties. Another aim of this study is benefitting from the concept of algorithmic complexity to obtain the fractional-order derivative with the least complexity in order that it would be possible to achieve the optimized solution. To this end, the following steps were applied and integrated. Firstly, the Caputo fractional-order derivative with three-parametric Mittag-Leffler function $$(\alpha ,~\beta ,~\gamma )$$ ( α , β , γ ) was applied to the diabetes dataset. Thus, new fractional models with varying degrees were established by ensuring data fitting through the fitting algorithm Mittag-Leffler function with three parameters $$(\alpha ,~\beta ,~\gamma )$$ ( α , β , γ ) based on heavy-tailed distributions. Following this application, the new dataset, named the mfc_diabetes, was obtained. Secondly, classical derivative (calculus) was applied to the diabetes dataset, which yielded the cd_diabetes dataset. Subsequently, the performance of the new dataset as obtained from the first step and of the dataset obtained from the second step as well as of the diabetes dataset was compared through the application of the feed forward back propagation (FFBP) algorithm, which is one of the ANN algorithms. Next, the fractional order derivative model which would be the most optimal for the disease was generated. Finally, algorithmic complexity was employed to attain the Caputo fractional-order derivative with the least complexity, or to achieve the optimized solution. This approach through the application of fractional-order calculus to optimization methods and the experimental results have revealed the advantage of maximizing the model’s accuracy and minimizing the cost functions like the computational costs, which points to the applicability of the method proposed in different domains characterized by complex, dynamic and transient components.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Statistics, general', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Most of the drivers use high beams while driving at night which causes blurred vision of the person coming from the opposite direction. This intense headlight beam hits the driver’s eye causing him to lose perception and ability to see objects or movements that are not directly in line with their eyes. To avoid such accidents due to temporary blindness of the drivers, we can use a smart system to reduce high-beam glare. The system will detect the high-beam glare using the sensor and will automatically reduce the glare so that the driver does not get distracted and maintains a clear eye vision while driving at night. This system is important because the accident rate is much higher at night only because of the high-beam glare of vehicles from the opposite direction.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Statistics, general', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Sociology, general', 'Professional Computing']"

In 3-D ICs, the inter-tier-via (ITV) is a critical enabling technique because it forms vertical signal and power paths. Accordingly, it is imperative to accurately and efficiently extract the electrostatic capacitances of ITVs using field solvers. Unfortunately, the cylindrical via shape presents major challenges to most of the existing methods. To address this issue, we develop a novel floating random walk (FRW) method by rotating the transition cube to suit the cylindrical surface, devising a special space management technique, and proposing accelerating techniques for structures with large-sized through-silicon-vias (TSVs). Experiments on typical ITV structures suggest that the FRW algorithm enhanced with the presented techniques is up to hundreds times faster than a simple FRW approach and the boundary element method (BEM) based algorithms, without loss of accuracy. In addition, compared with extracting the square-approximation structures, the presented techniques can reduce the error by 10X. Large and multi-dielectric structures have also been tested to demonstrate the versatility of the presented techniques.","['Engineering', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation', 'Engineering Mathematics']"

The hybrid power generation has been rising exponentially in order to meet the power demand. In such constraint, the distribution lines are becoming more complex to analyse the real-time operation when there is any disturbances occur. It not only initiate several power quality problem at industrial and utility consumer end but also disturbs the performance of the line. Therefore, study of performance assessment is important in a grid connected solar-wind hybrid renewable energy in the presence of dynamic voltage restorer (DVR). In this paper, DVR is connected to the grid under abnormal condition as the generation of solar-wind hybrid power varies from time to time. To access the system reliability and effectiveness of the scheme, different types of shunt fault cases are conducted with and without DVR. The result of this paper shows that during small transient disturbances or the fault cases, DVR helps to mitigate the sudden decrease of voltage magnitude by injecting the reactive power. The wind turbine (WT) and solar photovoltaic (PV) duo system when connected to the conventional grid (CG) should follow standard grid codes (GC). Further to validate the fault case, an attempt is considered using artificial neural network (ANN).","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']"

Combining the services deployed in a single cloud prevents to utilize the benefits offered by the other clouds. Hence, it is beneficial to compose the required services available in multiple clouds. The web services providing the similar functionality differ in their quality of service (QoS). The characteristics of the cloud platform where these services are deployed also have an impact on the quality of the services. Therefore, web services must be chosen based on their QoS as well as QoS of the deployed cloud to improve the QoS of the composite service. Towards this objective, it is proposed to compose services deployed in different clouds platforms based on QoS parameters of web services as well as cloud platforms. The proposed approach maximizes the satisfaction level offered by the composition in terms of QoS.

Accurate diagnosis can provide effective treatment for patients. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework namely SE-1DCNN-LSTM to automatically learn the latent EEG features of the two subtypes. Firstly, a SE block was used as a channel attention module to adaptively learn the weight of each electrode. Subsequently, a 1DCNN-LSTM network was applied to learn discriminative and effective patterns of EEG for MDD and BD. The noteworthy performance of proposed method was verified in 44 MDD and 26 BD patients with 81.10% and 83.16% classification accuracy in epoch-level and subject-level respectively. An extensive investigation of ablation analysis and window size of EEG epoch were conducted. Through visual analysis of electrode weights, we found that the weights of Fp1, Fp2, O1 and O2 electrodes were slightly greater. It demonstrated that the prefrontal lobe and occipital lobe may be possibly important brain regions for MDD and BD recognition. Overall, this study shows the effectiveness of the proposed model in EEG-based automatic diagnosis for MDD and BD.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Applications', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Mathematics of Computing']"

Plethora of model selection criteria have been developed over the years by constructing estimators of discrepancy measures that assess the divergence between the true model and a fitted approximating model in terms of their probability mass functions or probability density functions. This contribution focuses on a model selection criterion for count models, which assess the divergence between the true model and a fitted approximating model in terms of probability generating functions. The proposed model selection criterion is appealing in cases where the likelihood of a model is not regular enough. An example is presented where the proposed model selection criterion can be applied, while ordinary ones, such as the Akaike Information Criterion, cannot. Finally, the performance of the proposed model selection criterion is evaluated and compared with the respective of the Akaike Information Criterion based on a Monte Carlo study in a case where both approaches can be applied.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Data Engineering', 'Statistics for Engineering, Physics, Computer Science, Chemistry and Earth Sciences', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Mathematical Applications in Computer Science']"

The propounded dual metal double gate grooved trench (DMDGGT) structure incorporated the advantages of enhanced gate controllability and subdued the drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) owing to the presence of a bi-metal gate with dissimilar work functions. In addition, due to the inherent advantage of a grooved trench gate device of having a longer effective channel length by the trench gate geometry, the device results in a significant reduction in short-channel effects (SCEs).

Memes usually come in multimodal forms and can often promulgate offensive views by implicitly expressing a sense of humour. A meme’s visual and textual information is often disparate and can easily evade surveillance systems. Therefore, an automatic offensive meme detection system is required to combat malign content and maintain social media harmony. Past studies explored various multimodal fusion techniques to combine the visual and textual information of the memes. However, they fail to learn the multimodal content’s significant relationships and perform poorly in offensive meme classification. This paper proposes an inter-modal attention framework that synergistically fuses the visual and textual information by focusing on the modality-specific features. The state-of-the-art pre-trained VGG19 and BERT models are employed to extract the visual and textual features, respectively. The proposed method is compared against several baseline models on a publicly available multimodal offensive dataset. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach outperformed all the models by achieving the highest weighted f1-score of 0.635.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It is observed that convolution neural networks detect all relevant objects more accurately than traditional methods.

It was discovered that while testing with the existing method, the rate of error increases; however, when the recommended adaptive approach was used, the spoof detection and performance gets improved significantly.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Cognitive Psychology', 'Personality and Social Psychology', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

There are dangerous scenarios when the receiver is in danger or critical stage not able to communicate. The sender might want to know what the receiver is doing although the video call is ringing the receiver will not attempt it. This curiosity leads to develop a novel feature called hidden activation of the camera without notifying the receiver during the video call ringing but the receiver has to enable the spy feature. This feature may also help when the important person is kidnapped and trapped by some violent gang. The feature might show the things that are in front of the camera as well as the backside of it although the receiver mobile is switched off but having reserved battery power. This feature will recognize the scenes that are related to the danger zone clip or the normal clip. If the clip is a suspected zone, it automatically alerts the police near the location of the receiver. If not, the sender will be notified the receiver is busy. The proposed feature aims to know the environment of the receiver. This will benefit society a lot in the issues of the contemporary environment. The results will guide the necessity of this feature and its performance.

Conditional effects provide an expressive and convenient way to model complex and intricate scenarios allowing a single action to have context-dependent effects. In comparison with other features of ADL, conditional effects are surprisingly tricky to handle. In this paper, We develop a new algorithm for plan deordering that supports conditional effects. The algorithm also preserves the essence of conditional effects while deordering so that the generated partial orderings can be further used or modified.

Due to the high cost and poor availability of the workforce, agricultural production of blueberries is becoming heavily reliant on robots. Within the EU-supported Flexigrobots project, unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) solutions are being developed for weeding, soil analysis, and spraying. However, to detect the problematic regions (regions of interest) and plan the UGV trajectories, fields are first scanned using unmanned areal vehicles (UAVs). In this paper, we propose a procedure for processing UAV images for inferring the allowed UGV trajectories in blueberry fields. First, the image dataset was acquired using a UAV equipped with a multispectral camera. Afterward, we utilized U-Net-based deep neural network (DNN) models for semantic segmentation of blueberry rows and enhanced the results with Radon transform and additional image post-processing steps. The quality of the obtained segmentation mask is analyzed through the ranking of trained models in terms of the intersection over union (IoU) and F1-score metrics.

Predicting patients’ lung cancer survivability has become a trendy research topic by scholars from medicine and computer science domains. In this article, a novel approach to the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is proposed for the precise and automatic classification of lung cancer. Specifically, the auto weight dilated convolutional unit utilized multi-scale convolutional feature maps to acquire lung cancer features at different scales and employed a learnable set of parameters to fuse convolutional feature maps in encoding layers. The AD unit is an effective architecture for feature extraction in the encoding stage. We used the advantages of the U-Net network for deep and shallow features, combined with AD units to multimodal image classification. In this model, the four channel model inputs correspond to the CT images of four modes, respectively. The main body of the network is composed of auto-weight dilated (AD) unit, Residual (Res) unit, linear upsampling, and the first and last convolution units.. The network that applied Block-R3 had higher segmentation performance than the networks of Block-R1 and Block-R2 experimental results indicated that DCN had outperformed all the six classical machine learning algorithms in predicting the survival period of lung cancer patients with an accuracy of 88.58%.

Because medical services are not accessible in rural locations, people often overlook initial signs which might deteriorate over time. This is thus an increasing demand for a high-precision automated skin disorder classification method. To detect skin diseases, it is first necessary to remove the skin from the body. Five different machine learning methods were selected and performed on skin infection information to forecast the precise skin illness classification. From a few methods for machine learning, Naïve Bayes, uninformed mountain pastures, logistical regression, SVM and KNN have been developed. A comparable analysis was conducted using graphs based on cross validation values and training accuracy.

Numerous researches are interested in encryption, which protects the images from ending up in the hands of unauthorized third parties. This paper proposes an image encryption scheme using chaotic systems, DNA manipulation, and a modified Arnold transform. Both DNA manipulation and hyperchaotic Lorenz system are utilized in the substitution of the images’ pixel values. An additional role of hyperchaotic Lorenz system is that it generates the random numbers required within the DNA manipulation steps. DNA cycling is implemented based on simple DNA coding rules and DNA addition and subtraction rules with modulus operation. The modified Arnold transform alters the pixels’ positions, where it guarantees effective pixel permutation that never outputs the same input pixels arrangement again. The proposed design is simple and amenable for hardware realization. Several well established performance evaluation tests including statistical properties of the encrypted image, key space, and differential attack analysis were conducted for several images. The proposed scheme passed the tests and demonstrated good results compared to several recent chaos-based image encryption schemes.","['Computer Science', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Computer Communication Networks', 'Database Management', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.

Accurate diagnosing of skin cancer or lesion by observing or with hand-crafted methods is a more challenging task for expert dermatologists. Therefore, an automated and intelligent system is essential for the accurate detection of lesions. In this work, we have used a dense convolutional network (DenseNet) for automated skin lesions classification of seven types of skin lesions comprising of basal cell carcinoma, melanoma, melanocytic nevi, actinic keratosis/bowens disease, dermatofibroma, benign keratosis, and vascular lesion. The dense convolutional network used comprised of 5 dense blocks and each dense block comprised of batch normalization layer, ReLU, and two convolution layers which empower the maximum information flow between layers. The Softmax loss combined with image feature similarity restraint is further used to minimize the misclassification loss and to preserve the intra-class feature similarity scatter. We evaluated our model on the HAM10000 dataset, which consists of 10,015 images of seven skin lesion types. Our method achieved AUC of 0.96 and a precision of 0.92 for melanocytic nevi.

This paper presents a more secure method to carry out ATM transactions using hand gesture recognition and hand vein verification. In order to avoid pin hacking using techniques like shoulder surfing, pin verification using hand gesture recognition model is implemented. The 4-digit security pin will be entered by posing hand gestures inside a chamber. This method also focuses on easing the use of ATMs for blind people. The voice based instruction module helps the blind people to carry out the transactions without any assistance from other people. The security is enhanced with the help of a hand vein recognition system which is one of the newest biometric techniques. The vein patterns under the skin are difficult to replicate thereby making it very secure. The hand vein images captured using NoIR camera are preprocessed followed by extraction of features for vein recognition. Since the model is deployed on raspberry pi, it provides a cost effective approach as compared to sensor technology. The results of the proposed model of hand gesture recognition showed an accuracy of around 98% for both the train and test dataset.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Management']"

Robust clustering and mixture modelling procedures, that can resist certain amount of contaminating data, can be introduced by considering trimmed versions of those classification and mixture likelihoods. Without appropriate constrains on the scatter matrices of the components, these trimmed likelihood maximizations result in ill-posed problems. Moreover, non-interesting or “spurious” clusters are often detected by unconstrained algorithms aimed at maximizing these trimmed likelihood criteria. A useful approach to avoid spurious solutions is to restrict relative components scatter by prespecified tuning constants. Recently new methodologies for constrained parsimonious model-based clustering have been introduced which include, in the untrimmed case, the 14 parsimonious models that are often applied in model-based clustering when assuming normal components as limit cases. In this paper we extend this approach to cope with the presence of atypical observations and discuss two viable strategies for automatically estimating the restriction parameters.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

RDF models are used in business applications and by research teams who wish to share their data with the community. Generally, most RDF stores are optimized for queries, but usually, this is achieved at the cost of increased disk space consumption. Renting a dedicated server with a large volume of local storage is quite expensive, especially for small research teams and business startups which makes it an important factor in choosing the data storage. In this study we compared disk space usage of four popular triple storage which can serve as SPARQL (an SQL-like query language) endpoints, depending on the amount and structure of the loaded RDF data. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has compared the disk space occupied by triple stores. We found that all of the compared open-source solutions, namely Apache Jena Fuseki, consume large amounts of hard disk space and should be used with caution in resource-limited environments. The data structure – one large graph or many smaller named graphs – strongly affected Parliament’s disk space usage so it also should be taken into account when selecting an RDF storage. Free versions of commercial systems show adequate disk consumption and appear to be weakly dependent on data structure, but Ontotext GraphDb is deliberately limited in performance, and Stardog is limited in license term and may need additional manual maintenance.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The estimators and tests developed by this approach depend on a tuning parameter $$\beta $$ β . The choice of $$\beta $$ β is, however, one of the main drawbacks of this perspective. In this paper, given a data set, we study different methods for the choice of the “optimal” tuning parameter including the iterative-Warwick and Jones (IWJ) algorithm (Basak et al. [ 8 ]) or the minimization of some loss functions of the observed data. While IWJ algorithm seems to be a good approach for low and moderate contamination, some simulations do suggest that minimizing the mean absolute error of the observed probabilities is as least as efficient as the IWJ algorithm for high contamination, avoiding heavier computations.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Data Engineering', 'Statistics for Engineering, Physics, Computer Science, Chemistry and Earth Sciences', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Mathematical Applications in Computer Science']"

This is evidenced by the industrial practice of interconnect capacitance extraction during the design of high-performance very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits. In this chapter, the FRW algorithm is enhanced through the distributed parallel computing. With an efficient and adaptive task allocation scheme, the communication among different computer nodes is largely reduced. A distributed algorithm for accelerating the space management is also proposed. They have been implemented with message passing interface (MPI) and applied to the high-precision capacitance simulation for touchscreen design, along with the interconnect capacitance extraction of VLSI circuits. In addition, the techniques to enhance the reproducibility of the parallel FRW algorithm are presented, which ensure that same result is reproduced while rerunning the parallel FRW solver with same settings. Experiments on a computer cluster show that the proposed techniques achieve up to 114X speedup while using 120 cores, and build up the space management structure for a VLSI case including two million conductor blocks in just 22 s (37X parallel speedup on 60 cores). And, the proposed task allocation scheme is shown to be able to ensure the reproducibility while achieving better efficiency than other approach ensuring the reproducibility.","['Engineering', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation', 'Engineering Mathematics']"

Conjugation of E. coli bacteria to these ZnS nanosamples are done as well as these bacteria are sensed on dried samples based on memristor-based property. We have varied the concentration of bacteria, and as a result, a variation of current occurs like a hysteresis (Figure eight pattern) loop. ZnS is prepared successfully by the chemical precipitation method. Characterization was done by various techniques to confirm its specifics. In this study, the conjugation of E. coli with the antibody-conjugated nanoparticle is confirmed by taking absorbance before and after adding of E. coli in UV – Vis spectroscopy that results in a significant shift in the wavelength of absorption. Electrical characterization leads to a change in voltage gap among different molar concentration of bacterial conjugated ZnS samples. Results show that process basically leads to a mem-mode observation (either memresistive, memcapacitive or meminductive) in nature. Almost orderly declining pattern of voltage gap with bacterial E. coli concentration is obtained for the as-fabricated devices using ZnS quantum dot in bacterial estimation after conjugating antibody E. coli .","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics']"

Cancer is regarded as the second most deadliest disease after cardiovascular disease as it kills one sixth of people in the world. There are different sorts of cancers such as colon cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, blood cancer and brain tumor. The Brain tumor prevails as the most destructive cancer due to its low survival rate, assorted characteristics and combative nature. The brain is the crucial part of the human body as it controls the whole activity such as breathing, muscle movement and inducing the senses with the help of tissues and neural cells. Each and every cell has their own abilities; a few cells develop with their own usefulness, and some lose their ability, oppose, and develop distortions. These mass assortments of unusual cells from the tissue are called cancer. Harmful brain tumors are uncontrolled and unnatural development of synapses (brain cells). It is quite possibly the most dangerous and deadly malignant growth, which forces the requirement for programmed recognition techniques. There are so many methods existing in the literature to facilitate effective brain tumor classification methods. Hence, in this survey, we analyze 30 literature works concentrating on classification problems associated with the brain tumor using MRI, bringing into light the various shortcomings of the existing methodologies for classification problems. Here, the analysis of various methods will be facilitated based on several factors, such as performance metrics, datasets used etc. On the other hand, the analysis of the methods with respect to the merits and demerits of the methods are presented. Finally, the paper elaborates the prospective future research directions and provocations in obtaining the better classification accuracy for the MRI brain tumor categorization.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Management']"

In this paper, we investigate the design decisions and challenges of using deep learning sequential models for predictive health modeling. Our results show that the most successful deep learning health models to date, called transformers, lack a mechanism to analyze the temporal characteristics of health records. To address this gap, we propose and evaluate a new model called DTTHRE: Decoder Transformer for Temporally Embedded Health Records Encoding. DTTHRE analyzes patients’ medical histories, including the elapsed time between visits. We also evaluate the performance of DTTHRE on a real-world medical dataset for two health outcomes: (1) diagnostic and (2) readmission prediction. DTTHRE successfully predicted patients’ final diagnosis (78.54 ± 0.22%) and readmission risk (99.91 ± 0.02%) with improved performance compared to existing deep learning sequential models in the literature. DTTHRE predicts the health outcome for each medical visit, which increases the training examples available from limited medical datasets with no additional training time.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Mathematical Models of Cognitive Processes and Neural Networks']"

Based on the distances, a medoids test uses diversity to characterize the variabilities between and within groups. To reduce the distorting effect of outlier populations, we propose an alternative based on medians. To be precise, the medoid of each group has been related to the object that minimizes the median of the distances to the other members of the group, and the diversity within each group has been related to the median of the distances to the medoid. In this context, the distribution of the ratio of the diversities (between and within groups) is obtained by the method of permutations. The results obtained in a simulation study of a prospective character have established that, in the presence of outlier populations, the test based on medians provides a greater adherence to the level of significance ( $$\alpha =0.05$$ α = 0.05 ) than the test based on means.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Data Engineering', 'Statistics for Engineering, Physics, Computer Science, Chemistry and Earth Sciences', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Mathematical Applications in Computer Science']"

Sign language is one of the oldest and most natural form of language for communication, but since most people does not know sign language. Finding interpreters for different group of people is difficult. To treat the deaf people as one among the society, a user-friendly assistive device is necessary. This paper provides the details about the implementation of standalone interpreter using transfer learning for finger spelling-based American Sign Language using Raspberry Pi. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is created and tested for establishing a two-way communication to convert text into sign language. A language barrier is created using an assign language structure that is different from normal text. Hence, the users will now depend on the vision-based communication that will be able to bring normal people, deaf and mute people on the same grounds of interaction. There is a need to build a possible sign language translator, which can take communication in sign language and translate them into written and oral language.

On the one extreme, improvements in encryption technology have been achieved, while the integrity of traditional techniques has indeed been repeatedly violated on another. In an online shopping, financial activity, or exchanging message communication via networks, safe transmission or activity should be considered at all times. The traditional cryptography’s integrity is frequently reliant on computational limitations. The safety of the RSA system, one of most frequently used public-key encryption technique, is predicated on factoring’s claimed difficulty. As a result, traditional encryption is followed more by possibility of unanticipated developments that may be hacked or attacked in quantum code-breaking technology and techniques. In the proposed system of quantum key distribution, the Trojan horse attack and time-shift attack are discussed. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is often recognized as a way to provide encrypted systems or communication services that assure communication security and reliability. Algorithms based on the concepts of quantum key distribution have showed promise in the pursuit for a higher security approach. So, the proposed quantum key distribution (QKD), the best aspect of quantum cryptography, decides to make cryptography unconditionally secure in communication of the networks. This suggested system also addresses quantum key distribution protocols in the context of significant network loss, as well as different threats and countermeasures that are taken into concern. They produce a safe key by using traditional post-processing techniques like error checking and safety amplification. By using protocols, these keys can be utilized for making transmission completely trustworthy.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This proposed work aims to distinguish the range of the spatial vulnerability of landslide using ensembled machine learning models, including AdaBoost, random forest algorithms, and gradient boosting decision tree algorithms. Seven conditioning factors namely slope angle, slope aspect, land use, geomorphic features, distance from road, drainage density, and lineament density and a total of 272 landslide historical locations with a ratio of 70/30 were used to construct the spatial database. Estimate the efficacy of the ensembled models using evaluation metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, MAE, MCE, MSE, Kappa and AUC score. Results concluded that the land-use factor, vegetable crop area, is prone to high vulnerability zone in the study area. Additionally, results show that among all the ensembled machine learning models, the AdaBoost algorithm’s classification gives the highest accuracy value of 88.96%. However, the gradient boost decision classifier also outperformed with an accuracy value of 78.43%, and the random forest algorithm gives 72.61%.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']"

However, the manual counting method operated in hospitals and centers is time-consuming and inefficient. Many automatic processes in classifying WBC types were proposed using deep learning (DL) models. YOLOv4 is an emerging model for detecting objects with promising results in many applications including the medical field. In this paper, YOLOv4’s performance would be tested on classifying four types of WBC: monocyte, lymphocyte, neutrophil, and eosinophil. A mixed database of WBC microscopic images from an online dataset BCCD and a hospital dataset collected from the Vietnamese National Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, comprising of 10,275 images in total after the augmentation, was used for training and testing the model. The results showed that the trained YOLOv4 was able to classify equivalently well all 4 WBC types with the average accuracy of 97.8%, ranking the second-best option when compared to other contemporary studies.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Cognitive Psychology', 'Personality and Social Psychology', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

Classical game theory fails to correctly predict the probability of successful coordination due to its inability to prioritize salient Nash equilibrium points (in this setting, also known as “focal points”). To bridge this gap a variety of theories have been proposed. A prominent theory is the level-k theory which assumes that players’ reasoning depth relies on their subjective level of reasoning. Previous studies have shown that there is an inherent difference in the coordination ability of individual players, and that there is a correlation between the individual coordination ability and electrophysiological measurements. The goal of this study is to measure and quantify the electrophysiological sensitivity patterns in level-k states in relation to the individual coordination abilities of players. We showed that the combined model capabilities (precision and recall) improve linearly depending on the player’s individual coordination ability. That is, player with higher coordination abilities exhibit a more pronounced and prominent electrophysiological patterns. This result enables the detection of capable coordinators based solely on their brain patterns. These results were obtained by constructing a machine-learning classification model which predicting one of the two cognitive states, picking (level-k = 0) or coordination (level-k > 0), based on electrophysiological recordings. The results of the classification process were analyzed for each participant individually in order to assess the sensitivity of the electrophysiological patterns according to his individual coordination ability.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It is clear that membership degrees in fuzzy cluster analysis provide more information than crisp assignments of data objects to clusters. But fuzzy clustering has additional technical advantages compared to classical clustering approaches. Fuzzy clustering algorithms are less prone to converge to undesired results that correspond to local optima of the underlying objective function that is used for clustering. Furthermore, fuzzy clustering enables the definition of cluster validity measures that cannot be used in the context of crisp clustering. These purely technical advantages can be exploited to define fuzzy clustering algorithms that search for single clusters step-by-step. Finally, it is demonstrated how the approach of finding single clusters can be modified to estimate reference intervals or “normal ranges” in laboratory medicine.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The most commonly used predictor is the conditional expectation of the unknown value given the data, and its calculation is obtained from assumptions about the probability distribution of the process and the measurements of that process. The conditional expectation is unbiased and minimises the mean-squared prediction error, which can be interpreted as the unconditional risk based on the squared-error loss function. Cressie [ 4 , p. 108] generalised this approach to other loss functions, to obtain spatial predictors that are optimal (i.e., that minimise the unconditional risk) but not necessarily unbiased. This chapter is concerned with spatial prediction of processes that take non-negative values, for which there is a class of loss functions obtained by adapting the phi-divergence goodness-of-fit statistics [ 6 ]. The important sub-class of power-divergence loss functions is featured, from which a new class of spatial predictors can be defined by choosing the predictor that minimises the corresponding unconditional risk.

Moreover, time complexity of the proposed algorithm is comparable to Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort and TimSort but at the same time Randomised Quick Sort, Merge Sort and Heap Sort produces a better Time Complexity in their worst cases than Swift Sort. The experimental results prove the correctness of the proposed algorithm.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics']"

In this chapter attention will be focused on those particular kinds of abductive cognition that generate deep results, able to go beyond data thanks to a rich explanatory strength, in which asking “why” is the key-factor. Hypothetical cognition beyond data will be also described thanks to the illustration of model-based aspects of abduction, in which the activity of grasping the world, beyond what mere rough data suggests, takes advantage of models, diagrams, and simulations of various nature. Moreover, I will delineate the concept of manipulative abduction, first introduced in my book of Abduction, Reason, and Science , by showing how we can find methods of manipulative constructivity, in which cognitive processes are centered on the exploitation of external representations to the aim of reaching deep and very abstract results, able to powerfully transcend data, at the same time to create cognitive values “in” and “out” of data. In two separated sections I will illustrate (1) how the excessive emphasis on the merits of the computational programs which learn from data renders human abductive “creative” cognition increasingly assaulted and jeopardized, and (2) the challenges against human abduction and epistemic rigor on the part of what I call computational invasive “subcultures” based on rough computational explanations. Finally, thanks to the analysis of the computational system called AlphaGo , I will stress the attention to what I call locked and unlocked strategies that shed further light on the cognitive aspects of both humans and deep learning machines. The character and the role of these cognitive strategies is strictly related to the generation of cognitive outputs, which range from weak (closer to data) to strong level (beyond data) of knowledge creativity. Locked abductive strategies, even if cognitively weak, characterize (sometimes amazing) kinds of hypothetical creative reasoning and are typical of intelligent machines based on a massive exploitation of data, but they are limited in eco-cognitive openness , which instead qualifies human cognizers who are performing higher kinds of abductive creative reasoning, where cognitive strategies are instead unlocked and are able to transcend data.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

One such application is connected vehicles, powered by vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) technology to enhance safety on road. It enables all the vehicles on a road within its range to communicate their speed, position, and heading direction to roadside unit (RSU) through cooperative awareness messages (CAM). This process needs three major operations. The first one is receiving the data from the vehicles, the second one detects the collision, and the third one communicates it with the vehicle in case of an impending collision. In this study, we developed a sophisticated algorithm to detect collisions. On detection of the impending collision, RSU sends a warning message to the concerned vehicle. This alerts the driver to take control measures like brake and speed limiting. Here, we implemented the intersection and rear-end collision scenarios using simulation of urban mobility (SUMO) traffic simulator and developed vehicular network (VANET) on network simulator OMNET++ . Veins framework combines both traffic and network simulator. Now using this computerized testbed, we can simulate the collision scenarios on the connected network and evaluate the timeline and data delivery rate with which the latter received the signal in order to take control actions like brake or halt the vehicle.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

Development of summarization techniques for spoken data in a resource-poor language is a challenging task, especially due to the unavailability of appropriate datasets. In this paper, we focus on creating a dataset for speech summarization in Assamese, a low-resource language of Northeast India, the genre of speech being broadcast news. The contribution of this paper is twofolds: Firstly, a dataset of the audio samples of the broadcast news comprising of acoustic/prosodic features is developed, where each tuple is the manually segmented utterance representing a sentence. Each utterance is labeled as either summary-worthy or not summary-worthy, in accordance to the handcrafted summaries. Secondly, the relation of the prosodic features in indicating the informativeness of an utterance is evaluated. Binary classification is performed with the help of various classifiers, and a statistical analysis of the performance of the classifiers is presented. This approach for speech summarization is highly relevant for resource-poor language which does not have adequate resources to generate the textual representation of the audio. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to develop a dataset in Assamese language for speech summarization.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics']"

A wide range of technologies are currently available to detect and analyze SVs, but the restrictions of each of the methods are resulting in lower total accuracy. Over the past few years, the need to develop a reliable computational pipeline has arisen to merge and compare the SVs from various tools to get accurate SVs for downstream analysis. In this study, we performed a detailed analysis of long-read sequencing of the human genome and compared it with short-read sequencing using Illumina technology in terms of the distribution of structural variants (SVs). The SVs were identified in two families with three members each (mother, father, son) using fifteen independent SV callers. Then we utilized ConsensuSV algorithm to merge the results of these SVs callers to identify the reliable list of SVs for each member of the families. Furthermore, we studied the influence of SVs on chromatin interaction-based paired-end tags (PETs). Finally, while we compared the length and number-wise distribution between long-read-based and short-read-based SVs and their respective mapping on PETs.

The COVID-19 pandemic causes additional burden for healthcare systems. In order to overcome these challenges, digital technologies are increasingly used. Especially the past decade witnessed a tremendous boom of artificial intelligence (AI) within the healthcare sector. AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare and to mitigate the challenges healthcare systems are confronted with. The existing literature has frequently examined specific benefits of AI within the healthcare sector. However, there are still research gaps according to different application areas in healthcare. For this reason, an empirical study design has been conducted to investigate the potentials of AI in healthcare and to consequently identify its role. Based on a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), the following application areas for key determinants in healthcare have been identified: management tasks , medical diagnostics , medical treatment and drug discovery . By means of structural equation modeling (SEM), the study confirmed medical diagnostics and drug discovery as positive and significant influencing factors on the potential benefits of AI in healthcare. The other determinants didn’t prove a significant influence. Based on the findings of the study, various recommendations have been derived to further exploit the potentials of AI in healthcare.","['Computer Science', 'Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

On the one hand, the suitable architecture cannot be determined unless its performance is analyzed and compared to other architectures. However, measuring the effectiveness of a sole individual consumes a long time, and the situation becomes even more challenging when population-based methods are adopted. To hasten the process of evolution, significantly more computational resources would be needed. On the other hand, because the appropriate depth of CNNs for a certain issue is not known, it is difficult to confine the range of search space for design optimization. Consequently, a variable-length gene encoding approach may be the best alternative. However, a newly found challenge is identifying how to determine the crossover operation for distinct building blocks. In addition, the weight initialization values have a significant impact on the validated architecture performance, while tackling this issue necessitates a fine strategy of gene encoding as well as the optimization of hundreds of thousands of decision variables.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Data is sometimes encrypted for multiple authentication tiers, with a semi-authorized user gaining access to data scrubbed of sensitive or personal information, while a fully authorized user recovering the entire signal. Hence, in this paper, an encryption and classification process is done on the basis of AES together with chaotic logistic mapping for the purpose of ECG signal encryption as well as decryption. The feature extraction is accomplished by CNN. Finally, the data classification is done with the help of SVM. The suggested strategy achieves better classification accuracy in experimental verification, which is significantly superior to traditional classification algorithms.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

In addition to maintaining the data in a form that uses less space, they allow us to efficiently access and query the data in its compact form. The $$k^2$$ k 2 -tree is a self-indexed, compact data structure used to represent binary matrices, that can also be used to represent points in a spatial dataset. Efficient processing of the Distance-based Join Queries ( DJQ s) is of great importance in spatial databases due to its wide area of application. Two of the most representative and known DJQs are the K Closest Pairs Query ( K CPQ) and the $$\varepsilon $$ ε Distance Join Query ( $$\varepsilon $$ ε DJQ). These types of join queries are executed over two spatial datasets and can be solved by plane-sweep algorithms, which are efficient but with great requirements of RAM, to be able to fit the whole datasets into main memory. In this work, we present new and efficient algorithms to implement DJQs over the $$k^2$$ k 2 -tree representation of the spatial datasets, experimentally showing that these algorithms are competitive in query times, with much lower memory requirements.","['Computer Science', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Computer Communication Networks', 'Database Management', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-17544-2_6,en,NIANN: Integration of ANN with Nature-Inspired Optimization Algorithms,OriginalPaper,"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are stimulated according to the biological brain's connection of axons and dendrons. These neural networks perform a major part in the advancement of artificial intelligence and learning algorithms. Though initially used for image classification, in modern times applications of ANNs have been useful over numerous fields such as medical data mining, bioinformatics, natural language processing, time series forecasting, and in various optimization problems as well. Nature-inspired algorithms are a set of novel problem-solving approaches that are derived from various incidents occurring in nature around us. Each of the methods such as the BAT, genetic algorithm, or colony optimization methods were created by keeping a specific hard problem in mind. In recent times general purpose use of these nature-inspired algorithms has become widely popular in solving mainly optimization problems derived from the fields of NLP, machine learning, deep learning, classification, and feature selection as well. Nature-inspired algorithms mainly work by mimicking phenomena occurring in nature among various species on a macro scale. A set of nature-inspired algorithms such as the genetic algorithm family mimics the processes that occur in a microorganism such as a cell division, mutation, etc. Since these algorithms are inspired by nature and were developed keeping in mind achieving an optimal solution of a given hard problem, their application in general-purpose problems also yields satisfactory results. If an algorithm fails to achieve a satisfactory solution to a problem, it is easy to modify them according to the need of the given problem to overcome any obstacle. In this chapter, an approach is introduced that aims to combine the nature-inspired optimization algorithm with the learning model of artificial neural networks to provide a more accurate and streamlined output generation of the neural network. Nature-inspired algorithms can be used as a learning method in the ANN model. In contrast to that, an ANN can also be used as an objective function to a nature-inspired algorithm to improve its capability to generate an optimal solution. This chapter aims to explore both approaches in detail.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Health Informatics']"

Influential users can be detected through different centrality measures. When the rumor is generated through some influential users, they have more impact on society. Here, we have proposed a prognostic method to distinguish those influential users of online social media, based on network analysis. The susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model has been used for simulation of the propagation of information. For the particular seed nodes which have been chosen by practicing different centrality measures, detailed relative learning in terms of infected nodes is also exhibited. Selection of seed nodes through centrality measure is computationally exhaustive; therefore, we form a composite model, where the original social network is decomposed using the k-core, and centrality nodes are obtained from that decomposed network. Centrality measurements thus derived from the generated network are used as the seed of information propagation. Another important result derived from the empirical study is that not only the influential nodes, but neighbors of the influential nodes also have a greater impact on maximizing the effect of rumors.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics']"

Compressed sensing is the emerging signal processing tool that makes the transmission of data easy via low-data rate links. In the wireless sensor network applications, a group of sensors is used to sense any events and make decisions, and the collaborated information sensed by different tiny sensing devices are used to give the decisions about the occurrence of the particular events. According to the different applications and data types, the quality of service parameters and designing parameters for nodes are different. For dealing with low bandwidth in a sensor network, it is most important to reduce the transmitted data bits between sensor nodes or from nodes to sink. In the case of multimedia data such as image signals, the compression is beneficial for the reduction of these bits because fewer bits required less transmission energy. In some situations of the multimedia sensor network, some loss is accepted without affecting the too much quality of results. Data collected by nodes are spatially correlated with each other, so the image samples collected over time by the nodes are also correlated with each other. If only some samples are transmitted, then these samples are sufficient to give the knowledge about the suspected object inside the monitoring area, so the transformation-based compression technique is the good solution for the compression in the case of the multimedia sensor network. In this paper, a Hadamard transform-based compression technique is discussed for image compression with the consideration of different designing parameters of an image signal. In that manner, this work helps us to select the transform and source coding schemes for the compression of image data inside the wireless multimedia sensor network.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Mobile and Network Security', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The user comments obtained from the digital channels are crucial in order that the agencies or organizations can improve and develop their brand. Thus, an automatic system is necessary to analyze the sentiment of a customer feedback. Recently, the well-known pre-trained language models for Vietnamese (PhoBERT) have achieved high performance in comparison with other approaches. However, this method may not focus on the local information in the sentiment like phrases or fragments. In this paper, we propose a PhoBERT-based convolutional neural networks (CNN) for text classification. The output of contextualized embeddings of the PhoBERT’s last four layers is fed into the CNN. This makes the network capable of obtaining more local information from the text. Besides, the PhoBERT output is also given to the transformer encoder layers in order to employ the self-attention technique, and this also makes the model more focused on the important information of the text segments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach gives competitive performance compared to the existing studies on three public datasets with Vietnamese texts.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Especially in the domain that combines multi-issue bilateral negotiations and repeated negotiations. In this domain, the agents negotiate with humans over more than one item, and there are several rounds of negotiation in each game. Designing this kind of agent can be very challenging. Our agent needs to estimate the preferences of the human opponent in real-time, proposing fair offers that will be excepted by the human opponent but taking into account, not proposing offers that don’t increase the agent’s score. On the other hand, local search algorithms have proven to be effective in a variety of fields in artificial intelligence. In this paper, we present a novel approach for an automated agent for this type of negotiation by using local search algorithms, in particular: Simulated Annealing and Hill Climbing. As we analyze the results from our experiments and compare the local search algorithms, we show that local search algorithms can be more efficient in Human-Agent negotiation than traditional methods. Moreover, our agent is capable of negotiating efficiently and outperforming the human opponent.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Bitcoin is an example of cryptocurrency that has grow enormously since 2020 despite being in the market since 2009. However, cryptocurrencies are volatile and sensitive to thousands of factors and consequently is complex for humans to make predictions even more when those predictions should occur in a daily basis, requiring hence a significant effort. Due to this fact, investor profiles prefer long-term investments which can constraint their revenues. To overcome the aforementioned scenario this work proposes a scalable framework relying in Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict the price of bitcoin by automatically collecting and cleaning the data directly from the Web to process the dataset as input for training. This framework can also leverage new business models at scale by assisting the investors aiming realize its value in short periods in a continuous fashion.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Some kind of one-shot units do not get destroyed when tested, and then survival units can continue within the test providing extra information for inference. This not-destructiveness is a great advantage when the number of units under test are few. On the other hand, one-shot devices may last for long times under normal operating conditions and so accelerated life tests (ALTs), which increases the stress levels at which units are tested, may be needed. ALTs relate the lifetime distribution of an unit with the stress level at which it is tested via log-linear relationship, so inference results can be easily extrapolated to normal operating conditions. In particular, the step-stress model, which allows the experimenter to increase the stress level at pre-fixed times gradually during the life-testing experiment is specially advantageous for non-destructive one-shot devices. In this paper, we develop robust Rao-type test statistics based on the density power divergence (DPD) for testing linear null hypothesis for non-destructive one-shot devices under the step-stress ALTs with exponential lifetime distributions. We theoretically study their asymptotic and robustness properties, and empirically illustrates such properties through a simulation study.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This paper presents CNN-RNN (Convolutional Neural Network - Recurrent Neural Network) based emotion recognition using videos from the ADFES database, and we present the results in the arousal-valence space, rather than assigning a discrete emotion. As well as traditional performance metrics, we also design a new performance metric, PN accuracy, to distinguish between positive and negative emotions. We demonstrate improved performance with a smaller RNN than the initial pre-trained model, and report a peak accuracy of 0.58, with peak PN accuracy of 0.76, which shows our approach is very capable distinguishing between positive and negative emotions.

One huge advantage of a BPD-specific analysis lies in its tangible nature. More precisely, each button press (BP) constitutes a two-dimensional signal consisting of time and intensity coordinates, which can be easily illustrated. Moreover, one can also interpret BP signals by extracting several intuitive features, such as the duration and the maximum intensity. In this study, we analyse the characteristics of such intuitive BPD features. To this end, we conduct cluster analysis experiments with the following evaluation protocol. First, for each person-specific set of BPs, we will define ground truth (GT) clusterings by evaluating the BPs as time series and applying dynamic time warping (DTW) for the calculation of distances between two instances. Subsequently, we will extract a small set of intuitive features. Finally, we will compute the similarity between the DTW- and feature-based clusterings, based on two popular similarity measures. The outcomes of our experiments lead to the following observation. Extending binary BP information by one additional feature, i.e. the maximum press intensity, can already significantly improve the analysis of BP evaluations.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics']"

The two most common probabilistic models of network reliability are the all-terminal and the two-terminal reliability ones, with k-terminal reliability modeling the whole spectrum. For any of these models, the reliability of a network is represented by a polynomial in p . While the roots of all-terminal reliability polynomials have been extensively studied, only a small fraction of papers has converged on the roots of two-terminal reliability polynomials. A particular sub-class of two-terminal networks is represented by composition of series and parallel . Obviously, networks formed by composition are expected to be easier to understand, exhibiting kind of simpler/regular reliability polynomials. Additionally, compositions of series and parallel networks have been shown to be highly competitive on improving the reliability of networks doing computations—even when compared to hammock networks (a particular sub-class of two-terminal networks introduced by Moore and Shannon in 1956). Neither the roots associated to the reliability polynomials of hammock networks, nor those of composition of series and parallel networks have yet been investigated. In this paper we are going to start filling such voids by studying the roots of the two-terminal reliability polynomials associated to series and parallel compositions. This is an early stage investigation which will lead to several conjectures while also suggesting further directions for research.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Computational Intelligence']"

Medical scans, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), provide a wealth of data that can be exploited to overcome these constraints by creating advanced methodologies and approaches for tumour detection. These approaches can assist radiologists in offering a second opinion when predicting tumours, hence reducing the human aspect in the process . In this context, the paper proposes a hybrid texture-based feature extraction (HTFE) technique by employing Grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and Gabor Filters for identifying brain tumours. Specially, the proposed HTFE technique assists the classifiers Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT) in predicting Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary brain tumours from T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI (T1-CEMRI) dataset. To train and evaluate the classifiers, the HTFE technique extracts a total of seventy-two second order texture features from T1-CEMRI. In terms of accuracy, the suggested HTFE approach beats state-of-the-art techniques.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']"

An airbag is one of the passive safety systems available in an automobile. However, the airbag deployment needs to be controlled to avoid accidents due to it. In low-velocity crashes, the injury caused by airbag deployment is higher than the impact inside the vehicle. Children are more vulnerable to airbags when they sit near airbag housing without proper seatbelts or child seat arrangements. Deployment of the airbag when no occupant is sitting on a seat is unnecessary. So, it is important to detect the occupants’ presence in a seat and their classes such as a child or an adult. The primary aim of the paper is to detect the occupants’ presence and classify them into different classes. The occupant classes used are child and adult. In this project, we developed a technique to identify the occupants’ presence and verify the data from one sensor using another. We collected the image data of the occupants using a camera in a sedan and hatchback vehicles. We analyzed the images using a deep learning algorithm. The output classified the occupants as child and adult. A load cell sensor mounted on the seat was used to measure the weight of the passenger. This data was used to confirm the occupant classification. We evaluated the model detection and classification performances with the parameters such as precision 0.95, recall 0.97, and F1-score 0.96 for image dataset, and we got 0.73 as a classification accuracy for load cell dataset.

Users shop and pay through digital wallets in the expanding metaverse by pairing blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI). The relationships discussed in this discursive chapter focused on the company’s identification and customers’ repeat usage underpinned by the means-end chain theory, social identity theory, and prospect theory. A critical review of relevant literature, predominantly from 1991 to 2021, was carried out. A research framework was formed where the second-order constructs included the hedonic value, utilitarian value, and BMPA trustworthiness. BMPA identification was mapped as the antecedent variable of repeat customers’ BMPA usage. There are three proposed control variables, namely, (1) past BMPA usage, (2) gender, and (3) age. Past studies signified that an increase in perceived hedonic value, utilitarian value, and trustworthiness was having a positive impact on a company’s identification. A favorable company’s identification leads to an increase in repeat customers’ usage. However, the relationship was observed to be indirect. Perceived risk potentially moderates the relationship between company’s identification and repeat customers’ usage negatively. Using the dimension of customer value and customer behavior, this chapter recommends a Customer Outcome Framework for businesses that adopt the BMPAs.

In most countries, citizens have to go physically to elections, i.e., to a voting booth to make their decisions with pen and paper. In crisis, like pandemics, war times and other catastrophes, this may be impossible. But there are other examples, like concurrent events on the election day, that create problems. For example, in Berlin, on 2021 German election day, the city marathon took place on the same day, which lead to traffic jams that hindered timely delivery of voting paper. A solution to these challenges is electronic voting (E-Voting), where people can vote digitally from home on a specific device (or even on their smartphones). Actually, IT security mechanisms, like blind signatures, anonymity networks, homomorphic encryption and zero Knowledge Proofs exist, to name just a few, which have already been combined to create secure E-Voting infrastructures. We want to enhance these solutions with an additional feature we call ballot-changing. The three main benefits of our architecture are, firstly, limiting Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS), secondly, the possibility of changing one’s previous vote (ballot-changing), and thirdly, individual auditability, i.e., every voter can make sure that the election result is correct and that their vote has been counted.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Potential threats or risks related to requirements must be identified at the earlier stages of the development itself, so as to minimize the negative impact of subsequent affects. Researches reveal that VUCA risks, i.e., Requirement Volatility, Requirement Uncertainty, Requirement Complexity, and Requirement Ambiguity, are the basic sources of risks for other risks too. Complexity in requirements is one of the important factors affecting quality of the product. Computing and analysis of the product complexity in the requirement analysis phase of SDLC will give benefits in assessing the required development and testing efforts for the prospective software product. Failing to which, software designers and testers will need further clarification, thus slowing down the design and verification process. This paper attempts to establish a connection between the VUCA risks and propose a methodology to minimize requirement complexity. The various factors affecting requirement complexity are identified, in the requirement engineering phase. A Bayesian approach is proposed to predict the requirement complexity. The proposed model uses various complexity factors found through extensive literature review to manage requirement complexity of the software products.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']"

However, this sense of challenge must be carefully balanced to provide a successful experience. For instance, if the player is unable to progress due to a high difficulty, they will probably feel frustrated and will possibly leave the game session; conversely, if the perceived difficulty is low, the player will feel bored and will also likely leave the session. In this paper we report the design of an algorithm, based in biofeedback, that dynamically adjusts the difficulty of a video game: if the heart rate of the player decreases, then the difficulty of the game increases; if the heart rate of the player increases, then the difficulty of the game decreases. Through a controlled user study, we evaluated the effectiveness of the algorithm and its implementation in a prototype video game, in terms of performance, perceived gaming experience, and player satisfaction. The obtained results show that users who were affected by the algorithm effectively reported an improved player experience, completed the game levels in a lower time with a fewer number of tries, and displayed a better subjective impression. The proposed algorithm highlights the feasibility of dynamically adjusting the difficulty of a video game using biofeedback, hence providing an improved and personalized player experience. These results can be useful to designers and researchers in the video game industry, as a way to conceive novel—and more engaging—experiences.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Because of this, PID controls the motor's negative torque when the brake is applied. Knowledge, strength, and efficiency have all enhanced as a result of this new insight. In order to get simulation results, the proposed system uses Simulink's IDE to analyse the motor’s speed and braking force as well as the vehicle's battery charge. Regenerative braking may extend an electric vehicle's range when it is used in conjunction with neuro-fuzzy logic and PID management, as shown in the study’s findings.

In MAPD-TS, we consider the synchronization of the movement of transportation agents with that of external agents, such as trucks arriving and departing from time to time in a warehouse and elevators that transfer materials to and from different floors in a construction site. We then propose methods via which agents autonomously select the tasks for improving overall efficiency by reducing unnecessary waiting times. MAPD is an abstract formation of material transportation tasks, and a number of methods have been proposed only for efficiency and collision-free movement in closed systems. However, as warehouses and construction sites are not isolated closed systems, transportation agents must sometimes synchronize with external agents to achieve real efficiency, and our MAPD-TS is the abstract form of this situation. In our proposed methods for MAPD-TS, agents approximately estimate their arrival time at the carry-in/out port connected with external agents and autonomously select the task to perform next for improved synchronization. Thereafter, we evaluate the performance of our methods by comparing them with the baseline algorithms. We demonstrate that our proposed algorithms reduce the waiting times of both agents and external agents and thus could improve overall efficiency.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

These methods mimic the social behavior observed in various types of animals. Each of the individuals is only capable of performing very simple operations, but when a group of individuals is considered they can perform complex tasks.

More importantly, given samples of X and Y and considering so-called checkerboard estimators it is possible to derive a strongly consistent estimator for the dependence measure which also exhibits a good performance for small and medium sample sizes. After sketching the background on the dependence measure and its checkerboard estimator, and illustrating its performance in terms of a small simulation study we discuss how the studied approach can be generalized to the multivariate question of quantifying the extent of dependence of a random variable Y on an ensemble of random variables.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

On DNA microarray images, there are several spots. Spots on microarray images represent gene expression and show the status of normal and malignant cells. One of the approaches for enhancing and analysing an image is to use digital image processing. In this paper, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based denoising technique is developed and deployed. It is based on feature extraction from images. It is no longer necessary to manually extract features. The simulation is carried out using MATLAB to evaluate the performance parameters like peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index (SSIM). The comparison between different filtering techniques and CNN is carried out checking for the efficiency. The traditional image noise reduction methods such as median filter method, linear filter method and Weiner filter methods are compared with CNN. The advantage is that the CNN model’s parameters may be fine-tuned by network testing and training, whereas the parameters of traditional image denoising methods are fixed and cannot be changed throughout the filtering process and resulting in a lack of configurability.","['Engineering', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It built and operationalized a hardware and software infrastructure for smart environments called NEARS-Hub . The key function of the NEARS-Hub is to deliver data generated by The Internet of Things (IoT) devices near the edge. The processing of the collected data in homes and its storage in the event of break-in services are carried out locally at the level of the edge node. The goal is to provide high-quality services and a quick response time. Therefore, edge nodes must be capable of flexibility, interoperability, and scalability to adapt their services in case of unforeseen situations. A common modeling approach is to create services without separating responsibilities between system layers. However, very few solutions allow the administration of services and the provisioning of resources in a flexible way and as close as possible to the equipment, at the edge of the network, or, ultimately, at the places where the data has been generated. This article proposes NEARS-Hub , a lightweight edge computing platform for AAL solutions, which revolves around three main notions: interoperability, flexibility, and scalability. The design of the current version of the NEARS-Hub is based on knowledge from several home experiments. The proposed model is validated by comparing the performances of the NEARS-Hub with a version based on a classic AAL solution.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

For the floating random walk (FRW) method, the pre-characterization approaches must be employed to accurately handle multi-dielectric structures. In this chapter, we improve the pre-characterization approach in Yu et al. ( 2013 ) by permitting the cubic transition domains to contain three or four dielectric layers. This results in the techniques of pre-characterizing and utilizing these multi-dielectric-layer transition cubes. Then, a unified pre-characterization scheme is proposed to suit arbitrary multi-layer dielectric profiles. It avoids the pre-characterization dependent on specified dielectric profile, and preserves high accuracy. Experiments on the test cases under actual manufacture technologies show that the improved pre-characterization approach averagely brings 13X speedup over the approach in Yu et al. ( 2013 ), with affordable memory overhead. The experiments also reveal the significant error caused by the dielectric homogenization approach in a commercial FRW solver. With the comparisons to other pre-characterization schemes, we finally show that the unified dielectric pre-characterization scheme exhibits the highest accuracy while costing the least memory usage, for test cases from IC and FPD design.","['Engineering', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation', 'Engineering Mathematics']"

Process mining helps interconnect event logs data and find any patterns in the process flows. Process mining (PM) provides a simple visualization to identify and organize data available in the healthcare system. We collected information from the hospital and applied PM methods. We processed structured and unstructured data and models using PM algorithms. Hospitals generate events logs that are considered complex and inconsistent. We found deviations and inconsistencies by comparing an existing process model with the event logs. In this paper, we created the design of Petri nets and analyzed the abnormality of the process flow. We propose an effective model to detect deviations using the event logs. Then, the abnormal activities are identified and displayed on the Petri nets. The Petri nets create clusters of dependent activities. The healthcare information from the hospital is used in the research process to convey our work.

In this study, we use a category learning experiment (CLE) as use-case, in which the participants have to learn a specific target from a pool of predefined categories within a certain amount of time. From a companion system-based point of view, it is important to detect certain anomalies related to affective states, such as surprise or frustration, elicited during the course of learning. In this work, we analyse the button press dynamics (BPD) data from an auditory CLE with the goal of detecting anomalies of the aforementioned type. To this end, we first select a small set of participants, for which we have definite ground truth labels. Subsequently, we apply DTW in combination with hierarchical clustering to separate the anomaly-specific data from the remaining samples. We compare the outcomes to clustering results based on the extraction of intuitive task-specific features. Our results indicate that applying the DTW approach in combination with Single Linkage Clustering in order to detect CLE-related anomalies is preferable to its feature extraction-based alternative, in person-independent scenarios.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics']"

In this paper, a waveguide array of 2 × 2 waveguides has been investigated with more than one waveguide excited simultaneously. Each and every waveguide available operates as a beam combiner, whose results determine the waveguide intensity, which means, the output intensity is determined by the waveguides used for stimulation. Hence, it is very important to select the appropriate waveguide in order to increase the intensity and visibility of outputs. The primary goal of this study is to determine which metaheuristic technique can fix the issues of waveguide selection. To achieve this, a basic variant of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm has been implemented and its software simulation has been done. An analysis is also carried out by calculating the performance matrix concerning magnification, intensity, visibility, and 1/Signal to Noise Ratio. Simulation results are compared with the existing models, which demonstrate an improvement of the proposed system by achieving high intensity and visibility.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']"

In this problem, n length of string along with two integer ℓ and d are given as input and need to generate all possible sequence of length m, where each occurrence varies from at most d points. Generating Common d-Neighborhood is a vital step to find the planted motifs in every version of PMS algorithm. Particularly, in this step, we find the set of d-neighborhood between two ℓ-mers if the sufficient pruning conditions are fulfilled. In this paper, we have analyzed the previous algorithms for finding d-neighborhood and proposed a faster approach that reduces the searching time in the sample driven part of the algorithms. In particular, we have used dynamic programming techniques to reduce the repetitive calculation of the values of common subtrees and used advanced data structures to make the algorithm more time efficient.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The paradigm shift fueled by rapid data generation and higher storage capabilities has resulted in a massive transition across data storage technologies. Traditional database management systems being used in record-based transactional applications are paving the way for new rapid engagement-based data stores leading the newer applications. This transition is a result of a sharp growth trajectory witnessed across many parallel technology landscapes including cloud for storage and processing, Internet of things (IoT) for rapid data generation and transmission, support for unstructured, semi-structured and structured data by social media platforms, and polyglot persistence supported by NoSQL, to name a few. The emerging applications thrive on insights acquired by data analytics, and immutability of data storage is expected to be one of the key factors in growth of forward leaning enterprises. There has been a constant rise in application development requiring a full history of transactions, which is both trustworthy and traceable. Such applications mandate the append-only nature of the data storage to support analytics and trust. Immutability is also the underlying premise of popular cloud native storage systems. This paper explores blockchain technology as a solution for privacy and disclosure compliance in stored healthcare data. Blockchain as a data structure is primed to store only small amounts of data to maintain the properties of immutability, tamper proofing, security, and transparency in applications and is not suitable for storing big data. However, healthcare blockchain implementations have several possibilities for storage management, and the paper presents a comparative analysis of the aggregation-based storage with IoT-based streaming e-healthcare application data for the use case. The in-depth analysis for the potential blockchain storage in the paper includes the cost factors, in addition to immutability and privacy preservation, and the results show that costs may be saved up to an order of magnitude 300 with aggregation.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

However, data gathering is often difficult and requires lots of resources. Synthetic data generation is a great complementary tool for data gathering that enables the augmentation of existing datasets. Despite not being a new concept, it has gained popularity in the last years thanks to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a neural network architecture capable of creating data indistinguishable from the original one. In this article deep-convolutional GANs has been used to artificially expand a gait dataset containing data of the lower part of the body. The synthetic data has been studied through three approaches: looking animations of the points and comparing them to the originals; applying principal component analysis algorithm to both datasets to visually assess how each of them is distributed; and by extracting different features from both datasets to compare their statistical differences.

Manufacturing in the Internet-of-Thing (IoT) era will be more efficient, better quality, easier to manage, and more transparent through integration of physical and cyber technologies in Industry 4.0-based smart factories. Factory automation relies heavily on sensors and AI to make the system intelligent. Sensor technology advancements and developments linked to Industry 4.0 serve as the backbone for the inclusive expansion of industry and the economic success of any country. It is imperative that manufacturing organizations and supply chains have access to the latest low-cost sensor technology for collecting data and putting it to good use. Standard sensor types include position sensors, flow, temperature, flow rate, pressure, and force. A wide range of fields, including motorsport, health care, manufacturing, the armed forces, and agriculture all make use of them on a day-to-day basis. Increasing efficiency through automation is the goal of Industry 4.0. The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief overview and viewpoint on the most recent advancements in AI and the associated problems. Attempts to define the main ideas and tools behind this new era of manufacturing in the early years of the so-called fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) always ended up referring to the concept of smart machines that could communicate with each other and with the environment. When it comes to the new industry 4.0, it’s the defined cyber physical systems connected by the IoT that get all the attention. Nonetheless, several tools and applications will benefit the new industrial environment, complementing the actual formation of a smart, embedded system capable of performing autonomous tasks. And the majority of these revolutionary ideas are based on the same background theory as artificial intelligence, in which the analysis and filtration of massive amounts of incoming data from various types of sensors aids in the interpretation and recommendation of the best course of action. As a result, artificial intelligence science is well suited to the challenges that arise during the fourth industrial revolution’s consolidation.

Today’s digital education aligns with the progressive dynamics of Industry 4.0, and with the increasing mix of information and communication technology (ICT), we have entered the era of Education 4.0. The ICT tools gather a lot of data content, which is generated through data generation in the form of text, audio, images, and video in online social networks (OSNs), blogs, posts, and many others. Usage of ICT has facilitated the conduction of open courses to masses of people connected through heterogeneous networked applications. Such courses termed as massive open online course (MOOC) platforms have grown significantly and have reaped high profits. However, users browsing for suitable courses in MOOC platforms are faced with challenges of selecting and filtering courses, based on current demands, effectiveness, and pre-requisite knowledge. Scientifically, it is observed that due to incorrect course selection, users are many times not satisfied with the MOOC course, which results in high dropouts. In the past, researchers have addressed the issue through recommender systems for users, but recommendation systems require effective filtering mechanisms for proper results. Thus, to address the research gap, in this paper, we propose an approach that is based on skills information from users’ LinkedIn profiles combined with ratings and review data of courses.

Gamification is a new concept in software engineering that influences the software development process. Along with the increase of gamification frameworks, gamification is a means to increase motivation and opportunities for successful project completion. The issue with gamification adoption is a dearth of a methodology or framework for developing a gamification system. To overcome this challenge, we employed the Kitchenham approach in this systematic literature study on gamification in software development over the last five years. This study aims to comprehend gamification framework design, gamification aspects, and the software development mechanism. We bolded that the most important thing to make gamification succeed is using the correct game elements. The results show that point is the most widely-used gamification element in the software development area, followed by level, badge, social engagement challenges-quest, leaderboards, voting, and betting. These findings will be used as inputs for further research into integrating the correct elements and framework in developing a gamification system for the software development industry. Another result showed that none of the studied papers used a common framework to build gamification in software development. It implies that the designers used their frameworks and built gamification from scratch. Consequently, it becomes a challenge and opportunity to be resolved in future research. We suggest that further studies develop mature frameworks that can be used in the software development area.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

Their deployment in the context of autonomous vehicles is of particular interest, since their limitations in terms of energy consumption prohibit the use of very large networks, that typically reach the best performance. A common method to reduce the complexity of these architectures, without sacrificing accuracy, is to rely on pruning, in which the least important portions are eliminated. There is a large literature on the subject, but interestingly few works have measured the actual impact of pruning on energy. In this work, we are interested in measuring it in the specific context of semantic segmentation for autonomous driving, using the Cityscapes dataset. To this end, we analyze the impact of recently proposed structured pruning methods when trained architectures are deployed on a Jetson Xavier embedded GPU.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Machine Learning', 'Robotics and Automation']"

The employment of data mining technologies in the healthcare system may result in the finding of relevant data. Data mining is used in healthcare medicine to construct learning models that predict a patient’s condition. Data mining technologies have the potential to benefit all stakeholders in the healthcare industry. For example, data mining may aid health providers in detecting theft and fraud, medical organizations in making customer service management decisions, physicians in discovering effective therapies and best practices, and customers in obtaining suitable and less expensive healthcare. Contemporary systems, due to their complexity and size, are unable to control and analyze the huge amounts of data generated by healthcare operations. Data mining is a technique and mechanism for converting a large amount of data into useful information. The fundamental purpose of this research is to look at what makes clinical data mining unique, to give an overview of existing clinical decision support systems, to identify and select the most common data mining algorithms used in modern Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS), and to compare different data mining algorithms.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

While DCOPs assume that variables are discrete and the environment does not change over time, agents often interact in a more dynamic and complex environment. To address these limiting assumptions, researchers have proposed Dynamic DCOPs (D-DCOPs) to model how DCOPs dynamically change over time and Continuous DCOPs (C-DCOPs) to model DCOPs with continuous variables and constraints in functional form. However, these models address each limiting assumption of DCOPs in isolation, and it remains a challenge to model problems that both have continuous variables and are in dynamic environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Dynamic Continuous DCOPs (DC-DCOPs) , a novel formulation that models both dynamic nature of the environment and continuous nature of the variables, which are inherent in many multi-agent problems. In addition, we introduce several greedy algorithms to solve DC-DCOPs and discuss their theoretical properties.

Previous neuroscience studies have proved that MDD patients have altered structural and functional connectivity between different brain regions compared to normal individuals. Measuring brain activities via electroencephalography (EEG) is a cost-effective and appropriate method for the detection of mental disorders such as depression. In addition, as deep learning (DL) is gaining attention in various research fields, increasing DL methods have been presented to diagnose depression. Inspired by these angles, this paper proposed an end-to-end spatial convolutional neural network (CNN) called DSNet for depression classification based on the resting-state EEG signals. Evaluated on a public dataset, our model obtained better classification performance with the accuracy of 91.69% via the leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation strategy compared to other DL models. The experimental results demonstrate that DSNet can effectively extract information on spatial differences between depressed and normal individuals and could be a potential model for MDD detection.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Applications', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Mathematics of Computing']"

We propose our Early Mental Health Uncovering (EMU) framework that conducts rapid mental illness screening with active and passive modalities. We designed, deployed, and evaluated the EMU app to passively collect retrospective digital phenotype data and actively collect short voice recordings. The EMU app also administered a depression screening survey to label the data. We collected data from crowdsourced and student populations, both of whom shared sufficient voice recordings for modeling. We thus assess the classification ability of machine learning and deep learning models trained with scripted and unscripted voice recordings.

For the student participants, deep learning models screened for depression with an AUC of 0.70 and suicidal ideation with an AUC of 0.72. Combining datasets did not improve screening capabilities, though the best performing models on the combined dataset notably required voice transcripts.

There has been a multitude of heterogeneous networking devices spanning different configurations and using a variety of access methods. A parallel evolution of the network infrastructure security is happening with increasing attempts to exploit the security vulnerabilities in mission critical cyber-assets of organizations. Several organizations invest heavily in security research using lengthy and cryptic mathematical models while ignoring the practical network implementation situation and focus only on the monetary implications of the attack and defense. Attack tree has evolved as a convenient and cost effective way of plotting the network in which an attack may take place and can also help organizations understand the way it can be defended. Attack trees combined with the MITRE ATT&CK framework are widely used for crown jewels risk assessment globally. However, the major challenge for information security experts using the attack tree methodology lies in manually creating the attack tree and plotting all the crown jewels and perimeter network so that it can be defended from attackers. We propose a test lab setup for simulation and attack tree generation, which can be used in conjunction with the MITRE ATT&CK framework and allow us to create and assess various attack scenarios while providing flexibility in subnet configuration and movement, addition or removal of networking devices. The lab can be cloud hosted with a popular cloud hosting on Microsoft Azure or may be created on a VM within a dedicated high-resource machine to be used as a portable testbed. The results indicate that both services have their own pros and cons based on the hours of usage, and the dedicated resource VM testbed may perform better in a low-risk potential small network while the cloud-based approach is useful for the scalable organizations with high-threat potential.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

More often than not, such mountainous regions tend to be seismically active. Structures located in steep slopes are vulnerable to earthquake-induced landslides and affect the integrity of the highways. We analyze two major landslide events that disrupted major highways in the past and generate fragility curves to estimate the hazard in such a scenario. We derive the curves based on landslides that damaged the highway by measuring the distance from the source of rockfalls. Our results indicate that the RC within 3–5 m from the crest of a landslide tend to be at a greater risk. In an event of higher magnitude, the fragility curves estimate lower probability of damage. This could be because the shaking itself causes enough damage than the triggered landslides. It was also observed for a distance of 10 m from a slope crest in a low-magnitude earthquake, the damage is the most. This shows that the momentum of the triggered rockfall increases due to increased distance and causes substantial damage on the RC highways. Damage caused by Taiwan rockfall event which occurred in April 2019 was assessed using these curves and was found to be moderate. Fragility curves generated in this study can be used to estimate the damage in a future scenario where there are highway constructions along slopes that are prone to rockfalls.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

The stamp attached to a document is used to determine the authenticity of that document so that it is necessary to identify whether a stamp is forged or genuine. However, nowadays, it is easier for the general public to forge stamps. This paper presents a practical approach for stamp verification, based on the three stages process similar to some previous work: stamp segmentation, classification stamp or non-stamp, and stamp authenticity verification. In each stage, this work tries and tests new algorithms/methods to give a new way of solving the problem in each stage. Firstly, in our approach, an unsupervised learning machine method is implemented to detect all the objects in the input image, so all the regions including stamps and text are extracted. Next, two separate models of support vector machine classification are constructed. The first one is to distinguish between stamps and other objects in a document. The second model will determine the object which was classified as stamps in the first model whether it is genuine or not. The results show that this approach can perform the stamp verification tasks effectively.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

The game, by analyzing the user, is responsible to aid him by giving him/her personalized guidance. The novelty of this approach is that it uses elements of the Montessorian theory, the phenomenon of addictive reflexes by Ivan Pavlov and the learning levels model suggested by Prensky. The Montessorian theory states that the subject has free choices in the learning environment while Pavlov states that the user can be forced into a specific reflex with constant positive or negative reinforcement. On top of these, with the usage of Prensky’s model, we create an endogenous learning process. Considering these theories, the reply mechanism of the game constructs personalized feedback that can aid the user through the levels of the game rendering the learning progress more natural and personalized.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In these works, a new cuckoo search algorithm trained with radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) is applied in the non linear channel for equalization. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm enhanced through the search process by the integration of discovery and exploitation. Therefore, instead of Levy mutated step size operator in CS, the Cauchy mutated operator is used to create the step size which will make a random number which is used to generate a new solution for the global search. The performance of the proposed equalizer can be evaluated by estimating MSE and BER by considering popular nonlinear channels and added with nonlinearities. The consequences of the simulation show the presentation of our projected equalizer better than existing neural networks-based equalizers available in the literature.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Statistics, general', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

This paper illustrates the exploratory data analysis performed on river water quality data. Water samples taken every day for five years from eleven sampling points positioned along the Bhavani River stretch exposed to man-made and seasonal factors have been considered for the study. The quality of river water has been separated between spatial pollution from anthropogenic causes and temporal pollution from seasonal variation. Examining the distribution, outliers, and anomalies of the data is critical to having a better grasp of the data and highlighting points from datasets that need to be investigated. Twenty-seven independent water quality parameters like nitrate, phosphate, fluoride, total coliform, alkalinity, turbidity, pH, temperature, etc., were used to find the water quality index and to build a prediction model. A river water quality dataset with 10,560 instances and 33 attributes collected from eleven stations on the Bhavani River was analysed. Box plots, heatmaps, pair plots, and histograms were used to conduct exploratory data analysis of experimental data in a way to differentiate between the sources of variation in water quality. The distributions of the attributes and their correlations were studied, which may suggest suitable solutions for data pre-processing requirements. The analytical results of the exploratory data analysis of river water quality data have been reported with visualizations.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Taking a Bayesian approach, we propose a latent-logistic regression model that directly accounts for subject-specific misclassification probabilities. The true unknown correctly labeled outcomes are considered missing data, and their value is imputed from the model conditional posterior. A Bayesian logistic regression is then applied to the imputed outcomes, accounting for uncertainty in the imputation process.

In mathematical terms, such systems are called deterministic dynamical systems. In the analysis of such system, continuity is usually understood in the usual mathematical sense. However, as many formal definitions, the mathematical definition of continuity does not always adequately capture the commonsense notion of continuity: that small changes in the input should lead to small changes in the output. In this paper, we provide a natural fuzzy-based formalization of this intuitive notion, and analyze how the requirement of commonsense continuity affects the properties of dynamical systems. Specifically, we show that for such systems, the set of stationary states is closed and convex, and that the only such systems for which we can both effectively predict the future and effectively reconstruct the past are linear systems.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Engineering']"

The current work uses game theory to address this issue of optimum allocation of bandwidth to these flows while simultaneously thwarting the DDoS attack. It quantifies the efficiency and effective data rates achieved by these flows as payoff. Similarly, it quantifies the attack payoff using the bandwidth occupancy by attack flows and the relative dropping of the elastic and inelastic flows. Further, the attacker’s effort to compromise and capture a normal machine and turning it into a bot is quantified as the attack cost incurred. The scenario is modelled as a two players: nonzero sum and infinitely repeated game. The proposed mechanism enforces a data rate threshold on the flows using average available bandwidth during an interval of interest to lessen the network congestion at the bottleneck link in a dynamic manner. The corresponding payoffs are computed. Based on these payoffs, the Nash equilibrium at a particular instance of time is analysed using simulations. Subsequently, the Nash strategies are obtained which favour to enforce the optimum value of data rate threshold to maximize the combined payoff or QoS of elastic and inelastic services while making the attack costlier.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics']"

The unification allows us to get a deeper understanding of different FL algorithms, to compare them easier, to improve the previous results for their convergence analysis and to find new FL algorithms.

In addition, for the correct forwarding of the asymmetrical CVAEs, it is essential to make certain that the decoder appropriately fits the resolution of the raw input data in the appropriate manner.

One was proposed by von Neumann and the other one was introduced by Moore and Shannon. For computations the gate-level method of von Neumann was embraced, while another one at the device-level was crafted by Moore and Shannon laying the foundation of network reliability. This device-level scheme was also intended for enhancing the reliability of computations, but was kind of sidetracked and ended up being employed for communications. Since then, steady advances towards single digit nanometer transistors have been constant. Lately, advanced technologies are in high demand for supporting the growing computational needs on which AI is blooming (as well as IoT and G5). As advance CMOS are sensitive to variations, it seems normal to analyze networks for identifying optimal ones, and the Moore and Shannon concept is a perfect fit for transistors/devices built and organized as arrays: FinFET, MBCFET, GAAFET, etc. Still, defining optimality in this context is a non-trivial task, as the conflicting power consumption and reliability requirements need to be analyzed and optimized simultaneously. For a better understanding we decided to start performing very detailed simulations of $$3\,\times\,3$$ 3 × 3  resistor/transistor networks including variations (relying on the free ASAP7 PDK). We are reporting and discussing a few of those simulations here. Their statistical processing will reveal subtle and unexpected links between classical Kirchhoff theorems (pertinent for power consumption) and Moore and Shannon reliability concepts (theoretical). Plenty of additional investigations will be needed. Still, the main conclusion (based on the preliminary simulations we shall present) is that identifying optimal networks for low-power reliable CMOS designs (for computations) is a complex but doable task.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Computational Intelligence']"

Since people of the elderly age group were not as exposed to technology as much as the people of the present generation, they face hurdles while using mobile apps. Furthermore, designers also face difficulties while designing user interfaces for elderly users. It is difficult for them to determine whether a designed UI component will be perceived by the elderly users as per its purpose. An elderly user may perceive a tappable UI component as not tappable and vice versa. Therefore, the objective of this research is to propose a conceptual framework for developing an efficient system to evaluate whether an UI is usable to the elderly people or not considering the tappability of its (UI) components. As outcomes, a deep learning-based conceptual framework for such a system is proposed based on the identified user-requirements through semi-structured interviews. An initial UI prototype of the system is also developed and evaluated by the real end-users. It is expected that the conceptual framework will be able to pave the way for developing a system to help the elderly user by increasing the usability of the UIs and to aid the designers in designing intuitive UIs considering the limitations of the elderly user.","['Architecture / Design', 'Industrial Design', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Digital/New Media']"

It was possible to reach the conclusion that the use of home automation in homes would include a better living condition in low-income households, oriented to the reduction of duplicated expenses or the efficient use of resources.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

We also present a simulator implementing this model which allows studying how different policies affect the spread of viruses. As we show, the simulator can be used to explore scenarios in various points of interest (POIs) like shops, public trams or fitness centres. It could be useful for policymakers to check (by changing the parameters of the simulations) the effectiveness of different regulations like limiting the maximum occupancy of POIs and mandating the usage of face masks to decrease the spread of aerosols. The simulator can also be used to compare the hazard level that different kinds of POIs pose. Also, the simulations can be visualised and showed to the public to increase support for the introduced measures and obedience to restrictions.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics']"

During their realization and operation, they have an impact on the environment, flora, and fauna but also on economic activities. The induced current, the magnetic field, and the noise produced affect quite large areas in their vicinity. The effect on the environment cannot be separated from the economic aspect regarding distances required in their realization associated with the maintenance costs and the access roads. By applying Fuzzy logic, a balance is realized between these two major issues, economic and environmental. Some factors need to be quantified, including the impact on agriculture, the visual impact, the unusable occupied areas for new roads and housing constructions, also associated with population health, animal life, migratory bird flight routes, TV signals, and radio reception. A multi-criteria model based on Fuzzy inequalities is used to solve this problem. The known values ​​for the electric and magnetic fields are compared with values ​​obtained by numerical modeling, and if necessary, the Fuzzy parameters are corrected. The 400 kV overhead power line from Project 138-Black Sea Corridor, Smardan – Gutinas area is analyzed as a Case Study. The Fuzzy method allows a greater degree of flexibility than the classic solutions used, being easier to adapt in various other cases.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Computational Intelligence']"

The Vortex Search algorithm established an effective Cluster Head (CH) selection mechanism and found the multipath routing using a weighted deep learning model to alleviate this issue and tolerate network loss. Dynamic Multipath Routing Protocol (DMPRP) with energy measure is used in the suggested approach for an effective CH selection procedure. To upsurge the presentation of routing without increasing the amount of packet overhead, a multipath routing protocol based on projected probability sites and path diversion is presented. Deep learning procedures are used to identify the most likely locations of nodes, which are combined by using a weighting function.

Fog computing could be relocated nearer to automobile drivers to fulfill their requirements with minimum network infrastructure assistance. Fog computing (FC) offers latency-sensitive and position-aware solutions that may be able to suit the needs of message dissemination scenarios in VANETs. Fog nodes in different fog clusters can collaborate to provide video streams of catastrophes or crises and provide accurate visual data about the surveillance area. The goal of fog clusters is to provide less frequent service data handovers between RSUs and vehicles. A framework based on software-defined networking (SDN) provides better versatility, extendibility, fully programmable, and global knowledge. Due to its unique characteristics, integrating the SDN with the vehicular FC network (SDVF) may result in significant security and privacy difficulties for the vehicular FC network topology system. This study will look at the overall advantages of SDVF networks, with a focus on latency consumption for video streaming between the accident scene and the hospital. The privacy risks and remedies connected with the vehicular FC network topology are discussed. Illegal vehicles, also known as rogue nodes, might launch a Sybil attack by transmitting false videos to redirect other honest nodes in the network, trapping them or causing disastrous effects such as automobile collisions. This article demonstrates the effect of the Sybil attack on the software-defined vehicular fog computing (SDVF) network using the scenario of a speedy traffic accident rescue with ambulances (EV).

The increased use of connected medical devices makes such an ecosystem more vulnerable and increases the cyber-attack surface. Traditional security methods are insufficient to deal with such a high degree of interconnected medical and IoT devices. There is a need for security approaches based on concepts of collaboration, cooperation, autonomy and dynamism to ensure timely security of the whole healthcare ecosystem. This work adopts swarm-based principles with multi-agent systems to meet collaboration, distribution and robustness requirements, thus improving the healthcare ecosystem’s security. The paper presents a swarm-based agent-to-agent communication model founded on the collaboration among primary and supervisor agents to acquire new knowledge related to the healthcare ecosystem. The proposed model is based on the direct collaboration between primary agents that provides supervisor agents with local security-related information and the indirect collaboration between supervisor agents that exchange stigmergic information through the environment to make a collectively informed decision. The communication model is implemented using the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) approach.

To prevent the spread of the Covid-19, people must wear a mask during conversation, shopping, or studying. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an application that helps to verify whether people wear a face mask or not.

However, the performance of existing systems still has limitations under difficult deployment environments where the camera's quality is not good enough for detection. Therefore, in this research, we study the benefits of generative adversarial networks to produce a stable feature for robust deep learning model-based facemask detection. First, the generative adversarial network is used to learn and discover stable features from the input dataset.

Finding frequent itemsets becomes a tedious task for large-scale datasets because of the huge demand for computational resources. To meet the demands of the ever-growing data, recently, a variety of MapReduce-based algorithms on Hadoop and Spark clusters have been redesigned to achieve efficiency in terms of runtime and scalability. These are developed to overcome the limits imposed by data size, mining speed, and cluster synchronization. However, because of the iterative nature of the FIM algorithms, existing methods still lack scalability due to the large size of intermediate data produced, high disk I/O and network I/O, workload skewness, etc. In this paper, we propose a Spark-based algorithm named Parallel-Eclat (pEclat) that uses Eclat as the base method. The benefits of the vertical layout of the input dataset in combination with the partition method are utilized to improve the efficiency. It helps to limit the movement of key-value pairs across the cluster nodes (shuffle overheads) during iterations. It deals with the issues arising due to large transaction ID (TID) sets while processing large datasets in a vertical layout. The computational overhead imposed in computing the intersection of these large TID sets or diffsets is also managed. Extensive experiments with benchmark datasets have been conducted to explore the efficiency and scalability performance. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. A significant speedup can be observed for some lower minimum support values.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The clustering of such a huge volume of data, known as big data, necessitates the development of highly scalable clustering methods. Density-based algorithms have attracted researchers’ interest because they help to better understand complex patterns in spatial datasets. As a result, they are capable of discovering clusters with varying shapes. However, most of the density-based algorithms are challenged by the discovery of clusters with varying density and the ability to cluster big datasets. The VDENCLUE algorithm was proposed to discover clusters with varying densities. However, VDENCLUE incurs high computation overhead, which is impractical for large datasets. In this paper, a parallel approximated variant of VDENCLUE is proposed, called MR-VDENCLUE. Besides discovering clusters with arbitrary shapes, MR-VDENCLUE can discover clusters with varying densities and scale up to handle big datasets.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Temperature, rainfall, and wind speed are among the weather variables considered in our case study discussed in this chapter. We describe a method for inferring people’s daily activity patterns, including the places they visit and when they do so, as well as the duration of the visit, based on GPS position traces of their mobile phones and Yellow Pages information. An analysis of 31,855 mobile phone users reveals that people are more likely to stay at restaurants or food outlets for longer periods of time, and to a lesser extent at retail or shopping sites, when the weather is extremely cold or the ambiance is calm (non-windy). People’s activity habits are affected by certain weather conditions when compared to their usual patterns. People’s motions and activities are evident at different times of the day. The weather has a wide range of effects on different geographical areas of a large city. When urban infrastructure data is employed to characterize areas, significant connections between weather conditions and people’s accessibility to public rail network are observed. This chapter gives a new perspective of how mobile phone GPS data can be utilized in the context of weather’s influence on human behavior, specifically choices of daily activities, as well as the impact of environmental factors on urban life dynamics. The conceptual framework and analysis discussed in this chapter are based on the original research by Phithakkitnukoon et al.

Using technology to automate fish species identification would positively impact marine biology. Since deep learning techniques, image classification problems have become increasingly popular. Wild natural habitats make it harder to identify fish species because of the complex background and noise in the raw images. Some of the most advanced approaches for categorizing fish species in their natural habitats have been developed in the previous decade. This paper demonstrated an automated approach for classifying fish species based on deep residual networks. Existing transfer learning models do a good job working with smaller datasets, but not so effectively. A novel RESNET model (SmallerRESNET) is developed to reduce the overfitting generated by the standard pre-trained RESNET model. Convolutional and fully linked layers are used in the more straightforward form of the RESNET model. We evaluated and compared six different versions of the RESNET model. In addition to the number of convolutional and fully connected layers, the number of iterations required to achieve 80.56% accuracy on training data, batch size, and the dropout layer is examined. Compared to the original RESNET model, the proposed and modified RESNET model with fewer layers obtained 90.26% testing accuracy with a validation loss of 0.0916 on an untrained benchmark fish dataset. The inclusion of a dropout layer enhanced our proposed model's overall performance.

doi:10.1007/978-981-19-6004-8_38,en,Brain Tumor Detection Using Image Processing Approach,OriginalPaper,"Brain tumors have been linked to an increase in death rates. To improve patients’ life expectancy, an early and accurate discovery of tumors is the first step, and categorization is used for a more accurate diagnosis of the tumor. Brain tumor identification is the most demanding and intriguing thing to conduct in medical image processing. Tumor location, size, shape, type, and contrast of tumor tissues are used in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). In the instance of brain imaging analysis, a machine learning algorithm is a feasible option. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is now the most common and effective approach for image categorization utilizing brain magnetic resonance imaging. It is, however, sluggish and lacking accuracy. The application of this well-known technology is DNN which is a model that is modified in the feature-extraction and segmentation phases to increase accuracy. This work presents a unique approach of detecting and classifying brain tumors from MRI scans of patients utilizing deep learning methods, as well as CNN for classification. The proposed system is made up of many steps, including pre-processing, feature extraction, segmentation, tumor detection, and tumor classification. MRI pictures were chosen because they outperform other imaging modalities in terms of brain tumor analysis. The MRI image datasets for testing and training would be derived from WHO medical image databases. In this also discusses other image processing approaches. Following a study of the comparative research, this is an extension of earlier studies that identifies and classifies tumors with more accuracy, sensitivity, and precision, shorter processing time with bigger datasets, and better performance than other systems that employed SVM and ANN classifiers.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Cognitive Psychology', 'Personality and Social Psychology', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

E-passports are biometric passports with an electronic chip inserted around them and offer rigorous verification through documentation that tangibly marks the passport holder. Information security is a big concern around the world and the biometric security approaches used in the e-passport like RFID chips have various security threats. In this paper, we propose Hyperledger as a solution, which is an open-source private blockchain with robust security compared to the public blockchain. Validation of transactions in a Hyperledger-based private blockchain is fundamentally different from most blockchain development frameworks to minimize the number of checks that a transaction should have, allowing for faster and more efficient transactions, without compromising any of the security aspects. We have secured the confidential passport information and biometric data using this private ledger and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), both of which have several security mechanisms like access control features, non-modifiable data and immutable historian records.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Cognitive Psychology', 'Personality and Social Psychology', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

In this study, the design of carryable IV frame aims to provide patients with safety, convenience in wearing, getting out of the bed, going to eat, and going up and down stairs. Due to bending or movement, the proposed control mechanism of angle compensation can ensure that the potential energy is sufficient to overcome the intravenous pressure for avoiding blood reflux.

Fitness devices are currently offering new services such as shopping or buying train tickets using contactless payment. In addition, fitness devices are collecting a number of personal information such as body temperature, pulse rate, food habits and body weight, steps-distance travelled, calories burned and sleep stage. Although these devices can offer convenience to consumers, more and more reports are warning of the cybersecurity risks of such devices, and the possibilities for such devices to be hacked and used as springboards to other systems. Due to their wireless transmissions, these devices can potentially be vulnerable to a malicious attack allowing the data collected to be exposed. The vulnerabilities of these devices stem from lack of authentication, disadvantages of Bluetooth connections, location tracking as well as third party vulnerabilities. Guidelines do exist for securing such devices, but most of such guidance is directed towards device manufacturers or IoT providers, while consumers are often unaware of potential risks. The aim of this paper is to provide cybersecurity guidelines for users in order to take measures to avoid risks when using fitness devices.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Professional Computing']"
doi:10.1007/978-981-19-2600-6_42,en,Citation Biases: Detecting Communities from Patterns of Temporal Variation in Journal Citation Networks,OriginalPaper,"Recent studies confirm that several journals exchange intentionally biased citations to inflate their Journal Impact Factors (JIF) mutually. It includes excessive self-citations, stacking, cartels, cabals, and rings. Microscopically, the key entities are authors, editors, and publishers. Identifying coordinated citation manipulation is complex because multiple dynamics are involved. Also, such behavior varies largely across disciplines. Hence, there is still a lack of automated algorithms to detect them readily. Nevertheless, the real problem arises when authentic journals with identical citation patterns (natural biases) are associated similar to abnormal patterns. Thus, our prime objective in this paper is to understand all reasons behind naturally occurring citation biases. This paper proposes a novel generalized methodology to detect such journals with irregular JIF inflations using community-based analysis. First, we model large-scale time-series citation data of 1606 journals in a network structure. Next, we detect communities from the resultant temporal network using a multi-layered modularity maximization algorithm. Broadly, we obtain four communities—Self-Citation (SC), Pairwise Mutual-Citation (MC P ), Group Mutual-Citation (MC G ), and Uni-directed Citation (UC). Macroscopically, we define the underlying community dynamics using network parameters. The promiscuity of the SC class is the highest, 0.90, and cohesion strength of MC G class is highest at 0.71. Microscopically, we present a case-by-case analysis from real-world data. An abrupt change in a donor's publication rate and sudden inflation in the recipient journal's JIF is a characteristic feature. Other features leading to natural biases include narrow domain specialization, publisher's impact, citations from newly published or review journals, overlapping author sets, and author self-citations. Consequently, future studies must carefully consider all these factors before modeling any citation anomaly detection algorithm.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Statistics, general', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Storage Representation', 'Data Structures and Information Theory']"

In this paper, we study IBM Watson’s Natural Language Understanding (Emotion and Sentiment), and CoreNLP’s Sentiment Analysis accuracy levels against an annotated dataset, so as to observe any difference when comparing a discrete emotion classification approach (Watson’s Emotion) versus a one-dimensional approach (Watson and CoreNLP’s Sentiment). We have found that one-dimensional approaches were more accurate (85.5% for Watson, 62.7% for CoreNLP) than the discrete approach (37.6%). Being aware of those accuracy rates, and how they classified those emotions, we use those same services to analyse Tinder biographies, and observe how users present themselves, and finally applying clustering algorithms to analyse any trends between the emotion and sentiment of their biographies and other markers, such as age, gender, location, etc. After analysing the biographies, we have observed a tendency for more Neutral presentations (45–70%), followed by Positive (15–38%) presentations, though IBM Watson’s sentiment over classified joyful presentations (73%). In terms of clustering, we observe three distinct groups according to the emotional tone of their biographies, and the information provided. With this, we aim to contribute a better understanding on how two widely used emotion and sentiment analysis tools compare against each other, and how users can be classified according to the emotional/sentiment tones of their biographies.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Aside from those applications in the design of (conventional) integrated circuits, reversible logic components are also a key ingredient in many quantum algorithms, i.e. in the field of quantum computing which by itself emerged as a very promising computing paradigm that, particularly these days, gains more and more relevance. All that led to a steadily increasing demand for methods that allow for an efficient and correct design of corresponding circuits. Decision diagrams play an important role in the design of conventional circuitry. In the recent years, also their benefits for the design of the newly emerging reversible and quantum logic circuits become evident.

This sequential process is extremely time-consuming and more importantly, knowledge from the fine-tuned model stays local and can not be re-used or leveraged collaboratively. To tackle this problem, we present an online federated RL transfer process for real-time knowledge extraction where all the participant agents make corresponding actions with the knowledge learned by others, even when they are acting in very different environments. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we constructed a real-life collision avoidance system with Microsoft Airsim simulator and NVIDIA JetsonTX2 car agents, which cooperatively learn from scratch to avoid collisions in indoor environment with obstacle objects. We demonstrate that with the proposed framework, the simulator car agents can transfer knowledge to the RC cars in real-time, with 27% increase in the average distance with obstacles and 42% decrease in the collision counts.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning']"

The competitor to boxing has recently risen in the form of mixed martial arts (MMA), which is becoming quite a famous sport, most notably recognized due to the Ultimate Fighting Championship promotion (UFC). As with most other competitive sports, it is never obvious who will emerge as the winner of a specific MMA bout, as the sport is very unpredictable by nature. This paper focuses on using machine learning (ML) algorithms and classifiers to predict the winners of MMA bouts in the Ultimate Fighting Championship promotion. The data used to train and test the algorithms and classifiers is sampled from the rich UFC database which includes details from all bouts that have taken place in the UFC throughout the history of the promotion. The predictions are obtained without using any data that can directly indicate the winner of a bout. The results are presented through accuracy percentages for two different types of sample sets. Successful bout prediction percentages range from 80% to just over 92% across all subsets. This model can be further expanded and modified to predict the winner for future matchups in the promotion.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

These trading algorithms are derived from strategies which encompass mathematical models. The practice of “algo trading” is quickly gaining traction in the world of fin-tech due to its automated approach toward trading and provision of increased liquidity in the market. We believe retail intraday traders across India should have tools to automate their daily trades based on the strategies they employ, seamlessly and effectively. Intraday trading requires the constant presence of a trader throughout the hours of a trading day, incapacitating them from focusing on other responsibilities such as their day jobs. Furthermore, currently, the few present algorithmic trading software consist of expensive fees and/or a confusing UI/UX experience for novice traders. Furthermore, problems faced by intraday traders worldwide, due to usage of algorithmic trading software include complex and incomprehensible user interfaces, trading of illiquid securities, handling of special days, exorbitant trading and brokerage fees, and multiple risks including regulatory, financial, reputational, operational and technological risks. We propose a clean, lightweight and object oriented approach toward algorithmic trading, eliminating the need for commercial algorithmic trading software. This proposed novel system aims to allow high frequency, multi-threaded trading strategies based on technical indicators such as MACD, Moving Averages, Relative Strength Index, Candlestick patterns, to be run parallely, reducing latency in high volume trades.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery']"

A geographical approach was taken to “zoom in” to the county level and to major regions in California and to “zoom out” to comparable states (New York, Texas, Florida). Nearly one-third of the domestic workforce worked from home during the pandemic, a rate almost six times higher than the pre-pandemic level. At least one member from 35% of U.S. households replaced in-person work with telework; these individuals tended to belong to higher income, White, and Asian households. Workplace visits have continued to remain below pre-pandemic levels, but visits to non-work locations initially declined but gradually increased over the first nine months of the pandemic. During this period, the total number of trips in all distance categories except long-distance travel decreased considerably. Among the selected states, California experienced a higher reduction in both work and non-workplace visits and the State’s urban counties had higher reductions in workplace visits than rural counties.

Over time, less study has been done on modeling migration flows than has been done on modeling other types of flows, such as commutes. One of the biggest hurdles to empirical analysis and theoretical developments in the modeling of migration flows has been a lack of data. Because a migration trip is far less frequent than a commute, it necessitates a longitudinal set of data for study. The data from a large mobile phone network is used in this chapter to infer migration trips and their distribution. Intra/inter-district migration flows, migration distance distribution, and origin-destination (O-D) movements are among the interesting properties of the inferred migration trips. The log-linear model, classic gravity model, and recently developed radiation model are investigated for migration trip distribution modeling, with distinct approaches applied in setting parameters for each model. As a result, among the different models, gravity and log-linear models with a direct distance (displacement) as a trip cost and district centroids as reference points perform the best. Among the radiation models, a model that considers district population is the best performing model, but not as good as the gravity and log-linear models.

We obtain the fuzzy PID controller by using the Genetic Fuzzy System (GFS) to tune the parameters of the PID controller. The controller regulates the pitch angle of the wind turbine and minimizes fluctuation in power generation in the presence of wind gusts. The number of inputs for the controller is taken as seven and a cascaded fuzzy tree structure is utilized for computational efficiency. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to find the optimal values of parameters and rules related to all the Fuzzy Inference Systems (FISs). The training is done in various step input wind scenarios with Integral Square Error (ISE) as the fitness function. The results show that fuzzy the PID controller is better than the PID controller in every test scenario.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Engineering']"

The complexity of predicting the best plants is high due to the unavailability of relevant information on the basis of crop knowledge that affects the quality of the forecast. In data mining, data segregation is an important step in extracting useful information. Dividing strategies such as decision tree, neural network, SVM, Naive Bayes, and KNN which makes this task difficult due to a problem such as random selection of key parameters. Here we propose a crop prediction system using a decision tree and compare the results of the proposed system with the different class dividers. Decision tree has been shown to be a powerful modeling and predictive tool, which increases its effectiveness. Crop prediction methodology is used to predict the correct yield by sensing different soil parameters and atmospheric-related parameters. Parameters such as soil type, pH, and temperature. For that purpose, we used a cutting tree. Agricultural researchers around the world emphasize the need for an effective way to predict and improve crop growth. The complexity of yield prediction is very high due to various multi-sided metrics, and the lack of modeling, which leads to crop losses. It works in the form of a dynamic collection of a variety of crop data reviewed in history to predict crop yields and improve agricultural decision-making accurately. The proposed system will incorporate measurement data obtained from storage and IoT sensors, pH sensor, weather department, and application of the machine–machine learning algorithm, predicting the most appropriate yield according to current environmental conditions. This gives the farmer a variety of crops that can be grown. Therefore, the project improves the system by combining data from a variety of sources, analyzing data, and analyzing forecasts that can improve crop yields and increases the profit margins of assisted farmers over time.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication']"
