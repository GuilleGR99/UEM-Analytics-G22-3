Literatures are sparsely particularly that of test work and simulation with PBM model on this aspect. The oil dewatering performance of a disc centrifuge has been studied with both test and simulation, which was based on population balance model (PBM). The gradient of the concentration and size of water droplets has been revealed. The results show that the simulation of PBM model is more realistic; the coalescence probability of water droplets is much greater than the fragmentation probability; due to the coalescence behavior of water droplets, the oil—water separation process will be easier; and the separation efficiency will be 1%–2% higher than that of conventional Euler—Euler model. In addition, when the separation efficiency reaches the peak, the optimal disc gap is about 0.5 mm.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

The proposed numerical model was applied to simulate the cone calorimeter test of two kinds of materials: (i) pinewood (charring) and (ii) low-density polyethylene (non-charring). Using a cone calorimeter setup, good agreement has been achieved between the computational and the experimental results. The model is capable of predicting the formation of the char layer and thus replicating the flame suppressing thermal and barrier effects. Furthermore, with the application of detailed chemical kinetics, the fire model was able to aptly predict the generation of asphyxiant gas such as CO/CO 2 during the burning process. However, the pinewood experiments showed significant CO/CO 2 emissions post flame extinguishment attributed to char oxidation effects, which were not considered by the fire model. Despite the limitation, the fully coupled LES model proposed in this study was capable of predicting the fluid mechanics and heat transfer for the turbulent reacting flow, solid-phase decomposition, and gaseous products under flaming conditions. In the future, it can be further extended to include char oxidation mechanisms to improve predictions for charring materials.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

Examples refer to coastal engineering applications as well as geotechnical or biomedical applications. Albeit the frequent applications, slight inconsistencies in the formulation of the governing equations can be found in the literature. The main goal of this paper is to identify these differences and provide a quantitative assessment of different approaches. Following a review of the different formulations, simulation results obtained from three alternative formulations are compared with experimental and numerical data. Results obtained by 2D and 3D test cases indicate that the predictive differences returned by the different formulations remain small for most applications, in particular for small porous Reynolds number Re P < 5000. Thus it seems justified to select a simplified formulation that supports an efficient algorithm and coding structure in a computational fluid dynamics environment. An estimated accuracy depending on the porous Reynolds number or the mean grain diameter is given for the simplified formulation.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

However, traditional sequential convex optimization algorithms suffer from shortcomings in terms of their poor real-time performance. This work focuses on applying the deep learning-based closed-loop guidance algorithm and error propagation analysis for powered landing, thereby significantly improving the real-time performance. First, a controller consisting of two deep neural networks is constructed to map the thrust direction and magnitude of the rocket according to the state variables. Thereafter, the analytical transition relationships between different uncertainty sources and the state propagation error in a single guidance period are analyzed by adopting linear covariance analysis. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed methods is verified via a comparison with the indirect method and Monte Carlo simulations. Compared with the traditional sequential convex optimization algorithm, our method reduces the computation time from 75 ms to less than 1 ms. Therefore, it shows potential for online applications.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

In this study, the dynamics of a spherical particle interacting with the steel—slag interface is numerically investigated using the volume of fluid method in combination with the overset grid technique to account for particle motion. The simulations have shown the particle’s separation process at the interface and successfully captured the formation and continuous evolution of a meniscus in the course of particle motion. A sensitivity analysis on the effect of different physical parameters in the steel—slag—particle system is also conducted. The result indicates that the wettability of particle with the slag phase is the main factor affecting particle separation behavior (trapped at the interface or fully separated into slag). Higher interfacial tension of fluid interface and smaller particle size can speed up the particle motion but have less effect on the equilibrium position for particle staying at the interface. In comparison, particle density shows a minor influence when the motion is dominated by the capillary effect. By taking account of the effect of meniscus and capillary forces on a particle, this study provides a more accurate simulation of particle motion in the vicinity of the steel—slag interface and enables further investigation of more complex situations.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

To deal with this issue, a feasible attitude trajectory generation method is proposed that utilizes a multiresolution technique and local attitude node adjustment to obtain sufficient time and quaternion nodes to satisfy the pointing constraints. These nodes are further used to calculate the continuous attitude trajectory based on quaternion polynomial interpolation and the inverse dynamics method. Then, the characteristic parameters of these nodes are extracted to transform the path-planning problem into a parameter optimization problem aimed at minimizing energy consumption. This problem is solved by an improved hierarchical optimization algorithm, in which an adaptive parameter-tuning mechanism is introduced to improve the performance of the original algorithm. A numerical simulation is performed, and the results confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

This paper reviews the numerical soot models constructed at different length scales, including macroscale, mesoscale, and microscale. The four key stages of soot evolution, including nucleation, surface growth and coagulation, agglomeration, and oxidation, are first described with the generally accepted mathematical formulations in each stage explained. Different computational frameworks and their pros and cons are then reviewed, including the one-equation empirical soot model (macroscale), two-equation semi-empirical soot model (macroscale), different variations of population balance model (mesoscale), discrete element model (microscale), and molecular dynamics model (microscale). It is concluded that the accuracy required and the computational cost available are the two major influencing factors to be considered when selecting the appropriate computational model. The user needs to assess the priorities in their specific application and evaluate different modelling options to find the optimal balance between the level of accuracy and computation resources required.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"
doi:10.1007/s42832-022-0139-1,en,Influencing factors and partitioning methods of carbonate contribution to CO2 emissions from calcareous soils,"['ReviewPaper', 'Review']","In calcareous soils, recent studies have shown that soil-derived CO 2 originates from both soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) dissolution, a fact often ignored in earlier studies. This may lead to overestimation of the CO 2 emissions from SOC decomposition. In calcareous soils, there is a chemical balance between precipitation and dissolution of CaCO 3 -CO 2 -HCO 3 − , which is affected by soil environmental factors (moisture, temperature, pH and depth), root growth (rhizosphere effect) and agricultural measures (organic materials input, nitrogen fertilization and straw removal). In this paper, we first introduced the contribution of SIC dissolution to CO 2 emissions from calcareous soils and their driving factors. Second, we reviewed the methods to distinguish two CO 2 sources released from calcareous soils and quantify the 13 C fractionation coefficient between SIC and SIC-derived CO 2 and between SOC and SOC-derived CO 2 , and to partition three CO 2 sources released from soils with plants and organic materials input. Finally, we proposed methods for accurately distinguishing three CO 2 sources released from calcareous soils. This review helps to improve the accuracy of soil C balance assessment in calcareous soils, and also proposes the direction of further investigations on SIC-derived CO 2 emissions responses to abiotic factors and agricultural measures.","['Environment', 'Soil Science & Conservation', 'Ecology']"

During this, the adhesive flows in such a way that, ideally, it completely fills the joint. In practice, however, areas with entrapped air frequently remain in the bonded adhesive layer. Within the scope of a research project, these flows are systematically analyzed in order to identify optimal initial application patterns for the adhesive and substrate geometry to minimise such risks. For this purpose, the authors use an efficient flow model, the partially filled gaps model (PFGM), extended in this study to include the functionality of trapped air pockets. Depending on the volume fractions of air and adhesive, the flow of both phases is computed. Therefore, the model is introduced and fully described, benchmarked with respect to its plausibility and functionality, and results obtained are compared with a CFD calculation. Thereafter, the functionality of openings and closings of the pockets are analyzed. Lastly, the model is then applied to a real scenario created with a Hele–Shaw cell measurement. The benchmark as well as the comparison with the measurement results show the high potential of this technique.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

In this work, the frictional properties of phthalocyanine self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with face-on (aromatic cores parallel to the substrate) and edge-on (aromatic cores stand on the substrate) orientations have been compared and the in situ structural variation of edge-on SAMs under frictional shear has been revealed by atomic force microscope (AFM). Face-on oriented SAMs show lower adhesion, lower friction, and stronger wear resistance, compared with edge-on oriented SAMs. Hierarchical structures of edge-on oriented SAMs have been revealed by frictional topography, which are consisted of nanoscale columns, micron-scale stripes, and centimeter-scale monolayer. The column structure deforms under increasing load force, leading to a stepwise friction force curve and a transition among three friction states (ordered friction, collapsed friction, and worn friction). The structural deformation depends on both the order degree and anisotropic stiffness of columns. Columns in phthalocyanine SAMs show a larger stiffness when shearing against molecular plane than shearing along the molecular plane. The presented study on the interfacial structure and frictional mechanism promisingly supports the designing of novel boundary lubricants and their application in engineering.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

However, the influence of fertilizer and weed species richness interaction is unclear. Nematode abundance and biodiversity in wheat and weed plots soil treated with nitrogen, phosphate and potassium fertilizer addition and weed species richness (0, 1, 2 and 4 weed levels) were investigated in a long-term microcosm experiment established in 2010 at Kaifeng, China. The results demonstrated that fertilizer treatment increased the abundance of total nematode, bacterivores, and plant parasites whereas it decreased the total genera number, the Shannon—Wiener diversity index (H′), Margalef richness index (SR), the total maturity index (ΣMI), and structure index (SI), and degraded the structure of the nematode community. In contrast, weed species richness increased these ecological indices and enhanced the structure of the nematode community. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the fertilizer’s effect was more significant than weed species richness. Redundancy analysis (RDA) demonstrated that fertilizer affected soil nematode mainly through increasing soil available phosphorus by 4.71 times and ammonium nitrogen content by 74.03%; weed species richness increased the diversity indices of soil nematode mainly through enhancing soil moisture by 2.07%. Our results suggest weed species richness may relieve the negative effect of fertilizer on the diversity of soil nematode community.","['Environment', 'Soil Science & Conservation', 'Ecology']"

However, it is quite challenging as human facial images contain large areas of similar textures, rich expressions, and large rotations. These characteristics also result in the scarcity of large, annotated real-world datasets. We propose a robust and accurate method to learn facial optical flow in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, we utilize various shape priors, including face depth, landmarks, and parsing, to guide the self-supervised learning task via a differentiable nonrigid registration framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable improvements for facial optical flow estimation in the presence of significant expressions and large rotations.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

As a popular application, composition recommendation for a photo focusing on a specific subject has been ignored by recent deep-learning-based composition recommendation approaches. In this paper, we propose a subject-aware image composition recommendation method, SAC-Net, which takes an RGB image and a binary subject window mask as input, and returns good compositions as crops containing the subject. Our model first determines candidate scores for all possible coarse cropping windows. The crops with high candidate scores are selected and further refined by regressing their corner points to generate the output recommended cropping windows. The final scores of the refined crops are predicted by a final score regression module. Unlike existing methods that need to preset several cropping windows, our network is able to automatically regress cropping windows with arbitrary aspect ratios and sizes. We propose novel stability losses for maximizing smoothness when changing cropping windows along with view changes. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods not only on the subject-aware image composition recommendation task, but also for general purpose composition recommendation. We also have designed a multistage labeling scheme so that a large amount of ranked pairs can be produced economically. We use this scheme to propose the first subject-aware composition dataset SACD, which contains 2777 images, and more than 5 million composition ranked pairs.

In this paper, we present an efficient end-to-end deep learning model for automatically detecting and removing specular highlights in a single image. In particular, an encoder—decoder network is utilized to detect specular highlights, and then a novel Unet-Transformer network performs highlight removal; we append transformer modules instead of feature maps in the Unet architecture. We also introduce a highlight detection module as a mask to guide the removal task. Thus, these two networks can be jointly trained in an effective manner. Thanks to the hierarchical and global properties of the transformer mechanism, our framework is able to establish relationships between continuous self-attention layers, making it possible to directly model the mapping between the diffuse area and the specular highlight area, and reduce indeterminacy within areas containing strong specular highlight reflection. Experiments on public benchmark and real-world images demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both highlight detection and removal tasks.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

The synthesized spherical N-CQD nanoparticles in the diameter of about 10 nm had a graphene oxide (GO)-like structure with various oxygen (O)- and nitrogen (N)-containing functional groups. Then N-CQDs were added to MoS 2 nanofluid, and the tribological properties for steel/steel friction pairs were evaluated using a pin-on-disk tribometer. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations for the friction system with MoS 2 or MoS2 + N-CQD nanoparticles were also conducted. The results showed that friction processes with MoS 2 + N-CQD nanofluids were under the mixed lubrication regime. And MoS 2 nanofluid containing 0.4 wt% N-CQDs could achieve 30.4% and 31.0% reduction in the friction coefficient and wear rate, respectively, compared to those without N-CQDs. By analyzing the worn surface topography and chemical compositions, the excellent lubrication performance resulted from the formation of tribochemistry-induced tribofilm. The average thickness of tribofilm was about 13.9 nm, and it was composed of amorphous substances, ultrafine crystalline nanoparticles, and self-lubricating FeSO 4 /Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3 . NEMD simulation results indicated the interaction between S atoms in MoS 2 as well as these O- and N-containing functional groups in N-CQDs with steel surfaces enhanced the stability and strength of tribofilm. Thereby the metal surface was further protected from friction and wear.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

Although suppression behaviours between hydrocarbon-fuelled fire and water-based suppression agents were extensively studied both numerically and experimentally, lack of numerical studies was conducted on fires involving water-reactive chemicals (i.e., Na, Li, and LiH), where extinguishment is barely performed by water-based active suppression system, as violent and explosive decomposition occurred between water and reactive fuel. In this research, a numerical investigation has been conducted on expandable graphite (EG) application for water-reactive fire suppression. Based on the discrete phase model (DPM) framework, a novel EG particle model is proposed to characterise the particle expansion that couples with superior thermal properties and chemical stability. A numerical assessment on large eddy simulation (LES) has been performed to study the temporal fire behaviours and the suppression effect of EG against the flame plume in various subgrid-scale (SGS) models. Four SGS models were adopted, which were namely Smagorinsky-Lilly, WALE, dynamic kinetic energy, and dynamic Smagorinsky-Lilly. As a result, the WALE SGS model was observed to be in a better agreement compared with the experimental data owing to its significant enhancement in flow diffusivity modelling. The WALE SGS model has achieved a more accurate temperature prediction and finer resolved turbulence compared with other SGS models.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to separate the proteins in earthworm homogenate, then differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified using MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS analysis. After2-DE, 36 DEPs were found and 24 of them were successfully identified. 79.2% of DEPs were upregulated compared to the control group. The maximum fold change reached 53.8 in spot 3108 in the 80 mg kg −1 As group. Two proteins were not found in the control group but found in the As treated groups. Proteins were grouped into metabolism, signal transduction, stress-related, transport, regulation, and predicted/hypothetical protein categories based on their function. The protein—protein interaction between the DEPs indicated that serum albumin (ALB) is very important, related to 6 other proteins. Proteins were then verified by western blot, the results were in agreement with the proteomic analyses.

Capturing human motion accurately from a monocular image sequence remains challenging; modeling quality is strongly influenced by temporal consistency of the captured body motion. Our work presents an elegant solution to integrating temporal constraints during fitting. This increases both temporal consistency and robustness during optimization. In detail, we derive parameters of a sequence of body models, representing shape and motion of a person. We optimize these parameters over the complete image sequence, fitting a single consistent body shape while imposing temporal consistency on the body motion, assuming body joint trajectories to be linear over short time. Our approach enables the derivation of realistic 3D body models from image sequences, including jaw pose, facial expression, and articulated hands. Our experiments show that our approach accurately estimates body shape and motion, even for challenging movements and poses. Further, we apply it to the particular application of sign language analysis, where accurate and temporally consistent motion modelling is essential, and show that the approach is well-suited to this kind of application.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

The FGDG was then applied at amounts of 0, 1.5, and 15 g kg −1 soil on either the soil surface or mixed throughout the soil samples to simulate no-tillage and tillage, respectively.

Mixing applied method (tillage) provided strong interaction with higher FGDG. To overall effect, the mixing-applied method performed better in controlling DP loss from silt loam soil, while surface-applied (no tillage) showed its advantage in controlling DP loss from clay loam soil. In practice it is necessary to optimize FGDG concentrations, application methods, and DP sources (runoff or leachate) to get maximized benefits of FGDG application.

Various geophysical processes have modified these regolith layers since their origin. Therefore, the landforms on regolith-blanketed surfaces hold vital clues for reconstructing the geological processes occurring on small bodies. However, the mechanical strength of small body regolith remains unclear, which is an important parameter for understanding its dynamic evolution. Furthermore, regolith mechanical properties are key factors for the design and operation of space missions that interact with small body surfaces. The granular penetrometer, which is an instrument that facilitates in situ mechanical characterization of surface/subsurface materials, has attracted significant attention. However, we still do not fully understand the penetration dynamics related to granular regolith, partially because of the experimental difficulties in measuring grain-scale responses under microgravity, particularly on the longer timescales of small body dynamics. In this study, we analyzed the slow intrusion of a locomotor into granular matter through large-scale numerical simulations based on a soft sphere discrete element model. We demonstrated that the resistance force of cohesionless regolith increases abruptly with penetration depth after contact and then transitions to a linear regime. The scale factor of the steady-state component is roughly proportional to the internal friction of the granular materials, which allows us to deduce the shear strength of planetary soils by measuring their force-depth relationships. When cohesion is included, due to the brittle behavior of cohesive materials, the resistance profile is characterized by a stationary state at a large penetration depth. The saturation resistance, which represents the failure threshold of granular materials, increases with the cohesion strength of the regolith. This positive correlation provides a reliable tool for measuring the tensile strength of granular regolith in small body touchdown missions.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

Specifically, we introduce a relational cross-attention module (RCAM) to achieve bidirectional message propagation across embedding sub-spaces. To improve the model’s robustness and update inconsistent features from the spatiotemporal embeddings, we adopt a bidirectional purification module after the RCAM. Extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks show that our FSNet is robust to various challenging scenarios (e.g., motion blur and occlusion), and compares well to leading methods both for video object segmentation and video salient object detection.

In this study, to represent the dynamics of indoor temperature and air quality, a coupled grey-box model is developed. The model is identified and validated using a data-driven approach and real-time measured data of a campus office. To manage building energy usage and indoor air quality, a model predictive control strategy is proposed and developed. The simulation study demonstrated 18.92% energy saving while maintaining good indoor air quality at the testing site. Two nationwide simulation studies assessed the overall energy saving potential and the impact on the infection probability of the proposed strategy in different climate zones. The results showed 20%–40% energy saving in general while maintaining a predetermined indoor air quality setpoint. Although the infection risk is increased due to the reduced ventilation rate, it is still less than the suggested threshold (2%) in general.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"

Multi-objective optimization could be an effective tool for tackling the aforementioned challenges. Therefore, this paper proposes a life-cycle optimization framework considering thermal comfort, which is beneficial to promoting residents’ motivation for low-carbon retrofit in arid climate regions. First, in response to the above problems, three objective functions are specified in the framework, which are global warming potential (GWP), life cycle cost (LCC), and thermal discomfort hours (TDH). To improve the optimization efficiency, this research uses Deep Neural Networks (DNN) combined with NSGA-II to construct a high-precision prediction model (meta-model for optimization) based on the energy consumption simulation database formed by the orthogonal multi-dimensional design parameters. The accuracy index of the modified model is R 2 > 0.99, cv(RMSE) ≤ 1%, and NMBE ≤ 0.2%, which gets rid of the dilemma of low prediction accuracy of traditional machine learning models. In the scheme comparison and selection stage, the TOPSIS based on two empowerment methods is applied to meet different design tendencies, where the entropy-based method can avoid the interference of subjective preference and significantly improve the objectivity and scientific nature of decision analysis. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is conducted on the variables, which supports guidance for practitioners to carry out the low-carbon design. Finally, the multi-objective optimization analysis for a farmhouse in Turpan is taken as a case study to evaluate the performance of the framework. The results show that the framework could significantly improve the building performance, with 60.8%, 52.5%, and 14.2% reduction in GWP, LCC, and TDH, respectively.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"

A positive correlation between the warming and thermal degradation in permafrost or seasonally frozen ground (SFG) has long been recognized. Still, a predictive relationship between historical wetting under warming climate conditions and frozen ground has not yet been well demonstrated, despite the expectation that it will become even more important because precipitation over the QTP has been projected to increase continuously in the near future. This study investigates the response of the thermal regime to historical wetting in both permafrost and SFG areas and examines their relationships separately using the Community Land Surface Model version 4.5. Results show that wetting before the 1990s across the QTP mainly cooled the permafrost body in the arid and semiarid zones, with significant correlation coefficients of 0.60 and 0.48, respectively. Precipitation increased continually at the rate of 6.16 mm decade −1 in the arid zone after the 1990s but had a contrasting warming effect on permafrost through a significant shortening of the thawing duration within the active layer. However, diminished rainfall in the humid zone after the 1990s also significantly extended the thawing duration of SFG. The relationship between the ground thawing index and precipitation was significantly negatively correlated (−0.75). The dual effects of wetting on the thermal dynamics of the QTP are becoming critical because of the projected increases in future precipitation. 自20世纪90年代以来,青藏高原经历了明显的增温变湿过程,这显著地改变了冻土的水热属性。气候增温与高原冻土热退化间的正相关关系目前已经被广泛认知,然而,历史时期高原变湿事实与冻土热状况变化之间的预测关系尚未建立。随着未来高原湿化过程的持续,气候变暖背景下高原降水量的增加对冻土热动力的影响将日益增强。本文使用陆面过程模式CLM4.5,模拟了高原增暖变湿过程中各气候区域土壤冻融指数的变化,计算了多年冻土和季节性冻土区冻融指数与降水量的相关系数, 探讨了不同冻土类型对降水量异常的热响应差异。结果表明,20世纪90年代之前,高原降水量的增加主要对多年冻土产生冷却效应:干旱区和半干旱区的变湿过程分别显著延长了活动层内的冻结时长及消融时长,相关系数分别为0.60和0.48；20世纪90年代后,高原降水量增加的空间差异性逐渐增强。干旱区的降水量持续增加（6.16 毫米/10年）,充足的降水对多年冻土起到了相反的暖化作用,具体表现为活动层内消融指数的显著减小,冻土消融期缩短；而湿润区的降水量呈下降趋势（20.10 毫米/10年）,这对季节性冻土的消融期的延长产生了显著地影响,相关系数为0.75。随着未来青藏高原湿化过程的加剧,降水量的增加对冻土热动态的双重影响将会变得至关重要。","['Earth Sciences', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Meteorology', 'Geophysics/Geodesy']"

Six simulations are run for the Chinese mainland on 0.1° × 0.1° grids from 1979 to 2008, and the simulated monthly soil moisture (SM), evapotranspiration (ET), and snow depth (SD) are then compared and assessed against observations. The results show that the meteorological forcing is the most important factor governing output. Beyond that, SM seems to be also very sensitive to soil texture information; SD is also very sensitive to snow parameterization scheme in the LSM. The Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5), driven by newly developed observation-based regional meteorological forcing and land surface parameters (referred to as CMFD_CLM4.5_NEW), significantly improved the simulations in most cases over the Chinese mainland and its eight basins. It increased the correlation coefficient values from 0.46 to 0.54 for the SM modeling and from 0.54 to 0.67 for the SD simulations, and it decreased the root-mean-square error (RMSE) from 0.093 to 0.085 for the SM simulation and reduced the normalized RMSE from 1.277 to 0.201 for the SD simulations. This study indicates that the offline LSM simulation using a refined LSM driven by newly developed observation-based regional meteorological forcing and land surface parameters can better model reginal land surface hydrological processes. 本文利用不同模式参数化方案、气象强迫和地表参数设计了六个模拟试验，并与观测进行对比分析，揭示了影响中国区域陆面水文要素（土壤湿度、蒸散发和雪深等）模拟的主要因子。结果表明，气象强迫是陆面水文过程模拟的主要影响因子，土壤湿度和雪深的模拟分别与土壤质地信息和陆面模式参数化方案紧密相关。利用新发展的融合观测信息的中国区域气象强迫和地表参数信息驱动陆面模式模拟，显著提高了中国大部分区域陆面水文过程模拟精度，并减少了模拟的不确定性。土壤湿度模拟与观测的相关系数从0.46提高到0.54，雪深模拟与观测的相关系数从0.54提高到0.67；土壤湿度模拟与观测的均方根误差从0.093降低到0.085，雪深模拟与观测的均方根误差从1.277降低到0.201。","['Earth Sciences', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Meteorology', 'Geophysics/Geodesy']"

Sensors with accurate and reliable measurements are critical for ensuring the precise indoor thermal demand. Owing to its high calibration accuracy and in-situ effectiveness, a virtual sensor (VS)-assisted Bayesian inference (VS-BI) sensor calibration strategy has been applied for HVACs. However, the application feasibility of this strategy for wider ranges of different sensor types (within-control-loop and out-of-control-loop) with various sensor bias fault amplitudes, and influencing factors that affect the practical in-situ calibration performance are still remained to be explored. Hence, to further validate its in-situ calibration performance and analyze the influencing factors, this study applied the VS-BI strategy in a HVAC system including a chiller plant with air handle unit (AHU) terminal. Three target sensors including air supply (SAT), chilled water supply (CHS) and cooling water return (CWR) temperatures are investigated using introduced sensor bias faults with eight different amplitudes of [−2 °C, +2 °C] with a 0.5 °C interval. Calibration performance is evaluated by considering three influencing factors: (1) performance of different data-driven VSs, (2) the influence of prior standard deviations σ on in-situ sensor calibration and (3) the influence of data quality on in-situ sensor calibration from the perspective of energy conservation and data volumes. After comparison, a long short term memory (LSTM) is adopted for VS construction with determination coefficient R -squared of 0.984. Results indicate that σ has almost no impact on calibration accuracy of CHS but scanty impact on that of SAT and CWR. The potential of using a prior standard deviation σ to improve the calibration accuracy is limited, only 8.61% on average. For system within-control-loop sensors like SAT and CHS, VS-BI obtains relatively high in-situ sensor calibration accuracy if the data quality is relatively high.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"

However, the airflow inside is more complicated and unpredictable. This study proposes a zonal temperature control strategy with a thermal coupling effect integrated for air-conditioned large-scale open spaces. The target space was split into several subzones based on the minimum controllable air terminal units in the proposed method, and each zone can be controlled to its own set-point while considering the thermal coupling effect from its adjacent zones. A numerical method resorting to computational fluid dynamics was presented to obtain the heat transfer coefficients (HTCs) under different air supply scenarios. The relationship between heat transfer coefficient and zonal temperature difference was linearized. Thus, currently available zonal models in popular software can be used to simulate the dynamic response of temperatures in large-scale indoor open spaces. Case studies showed that the introduction of HTCs across the adjacent zones was capable of enhancing the precision of temperature control of large-scale open spaces. It could satisfy the temperature requirements of different zones, improve thermal comfort and at least 11% of energy saving can be achieved by comparing with the conventional control strategy.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"

Several mechanisms have been proposed for explaining its occurrence and quantifying its frequencies, notably for automotive brake squeal, clutch squeal, and even rail corrugation. However, due to the complex and complicated nature of FIVN, there is not yet one fundamental mechanism that can explain all phenomena of FIVN. Based on experimental results obtained on a simple test structure and corresponding numerical validation using both complex eigenvalue analysis (CEA) and transient dynamic analysis (TDA), this study attempts to propose a new fundamental mechanism for FIVN, which is the repeated cycles of partial detachment and then reattachment of the contact surfaces. Since friction is ubiquitous and FIVN is very common, the insight into FIVN reported in this paper is highly significant and will help establish effective means to control FIVN in engineering and daily life.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

The proposed framework consists of an expert module focusing on scenes analysis, a CV module for automatic detection, an evaluation module containing thresholds, and an output module for data analysis. Based on this, the changes in the adoption of different CBR technologies (CBRTs), including light-translucent CBRTs (LT-CBRTs) and non-light-translucent CBRTs (NLT-CBRTs), in 24 villages in southern Hebei were identified from 2007 to 2021. The evolution of CBRTs was featured as an inverse S-curve, and differences were found in their evolution stage, adoption ratio, and development speed for different villages. LT-CBRTs are the dominant type but are being replaced and surpassed by NLT-CBRTs in some villages, characterizing different preferences for the technology type of villages. The proposed research framework provides a reference for the evolution monitoring of vernacular buildings, and the identified evolution laws enable to trace and predict the adoption of different CBRTs in a particular village.

However, the efficiency of these models relies on their capability to estimate more realistic building performance indicators at different temporal and spatial scales. The uncertainty of modelling occupants’ behaviours (OB) aspects is one of the main reasons for the discrepancy between the UBEM predicted results and the building’s actual performance. As a result, research efforts focused on improving the approaches to model OB at an urban scale considering different diversity factors. On the other hand, the impact of occupants in the current practice is still considered through fixed schedules and behaviours pattern. To bridge the gap between academic efforts and practice, the applicability of OB models to be integrated into the available UBEM tools needs to be analyzed. To this end, this paper aims to investigate the flexibility and extensibility of existing UBEM tools to model OB with different approaches by (1) reviewing UBEM’s current workflow and the main characteristics of its inputs, (2) reviewing the existing OB models and identifying their main characteristics and level of details that can contribute to UBEM accuracy, (3) providing a breakdown of the occupant-related features in the commonly used tools.

Photovoltaic production from grid-connected systems is leading this growth in terms of households. Alongside this development, concern about network security has emerged, because excesses of intermittent renewable energy on the grid could exceed voltage limits. Self-consumption, understood as the capacity of the producer to consume his or her own production, can partially solve these problems. Thermostatic controllable loads, such as heating and cooling, represent 50% of the total amount of energy consumed by buildings; the proper allocation of these loads could be a driving force for self-consumption. In this study, a demand side management strategy is proposed based on a building energy model equipped with an inverter heat pump coupled with a photovoltaic plant. The goal is to maximize the use of local energy from the photovoltaic plant (self-consumption), reducing the export and import of energy to and from the grid. This goal is achieved by optimizing the set-points in each room. An array of optimal set-points over six years is presented. The results show the capacity of the methodology to match similar values of self-consumption (70% in winter and 50% in summer) obtained by strategies based on chemical batteries. The findings are shown in an energy matching chart at different levels of detail (yearly and monthly). Color bubbles are added to the matching chart to help visualize the unmatched energy of the system graphically.

Physics-informed machine learning could address this need by adding physical consistency to such models. This paper presents metamodeling of thermal comfort in non-air-conditioned buildings using physics-informed machine learning. The studied metamodel incorporated knowledge of both quasi-steady-state heat transfer and dynamic simulation results. Adaptive thermal comfort in an office located in cold and hot European climates was studied with the number of overheating hours as index. A one-at-a-time method was used to gain knowledge from dynamic simulation with TRNSYS software. This knowledge was used to filter the training data and to choose probability distributions for metamodel forms alternative to polynomial. The response of the dynamic model was positively skewed; and thus, the symmetric logistic and hyperbolic secant distributions were inappropriate and outperformed by positively skewed distributions. Incorporating physical knowledge into the metamodel was much more effective than doubling the size of the training sample. The highly flexible Kumaraswamy distribution provided the best performance with R 2 equal to 0.9994 for the cold climate and 0.9975 for the hot climate. Physics-informed machine learning could combine the strength of both physics and machine learning models, and could therefore support building design with flexible, accurate and interpretable metamodels.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"

Micro-dimples were generated by a dual-frequency surface texturing method, in which a high-frequency (16.3 kHz) three-dimensional (3D) vibration and a low-frequency (230 Hz) one-dimensional (1D) vibration were applied at the tool tip simultaneously, resulting in the generation of the hierarchical micro-dimples in a single step.

The effect of surface textures generated with various shape parameters (long drop and short drop), dimension parameters (length and surface texture density), and operation parameters (load and sliding velocity) on the tribological performance was evaluated. Stribeck curves indicate that the hierarchical micro-dimples exhibit a lower coefficient of friction than the reference specimen in the high contact-pressure regions. It is also observed that variation in the length of a micro-dimple, the shape effect, is the major factor affecting the friction response of the textured surfaces.

Subsequently, the validated model is applied to investigate the effect of the overlapping impacts of particles on the target. Accordingly, the correlation between erosion severity and the impact locations of the two incident particles is quantified. The results show that the horizontal distance between two solid particle impact locations can significantly affect the erosion magnitude and pattern. The interactions of the resulting craters diminish when the horizontal distance exceeds 0.6 times the particle diameter. When the horizontal distance is approximately 0.06 times the particle diameter, the energy loss originating from collisions reaches the maximum, which modifies the crater morphology.

Recent FFM measurements on a NaCl crystal immersed in liquid (ethanol) surroundings displayed an increase of the effective contact stiffness, K eff , with the applied load, differently from similar measurements performed under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, where K eff showed negligible load dependency. Additionally, under UHV conditions multiple slip length friction with increasing load was reported, while in ethanol surroundings only single (lattice unit length) slips were observed. Our current understanding of this behavior relates the transition from single jumps to multiple jumps dynamics to the normal load (manifested through the amplitude of the interaction potential at the contact, U 0 ) and to the damping of the system. Here we have incorporated the effect of the load dependency on both U 0 and K eff within Prandtl—Tomlinson based simulations, accompanied by variations in the damping coefficient of the system. Introducing the experimentally observed load dependency to K eff resulted indeed in single slip jumps at critical damping, while multiple slip jumps were obtained at constant K eff . The average slip length increased with the normal load, particularly when the system became underdamped. Our work provides a glimpse on the relation between the characteristic observables in atomic-scale sliding friction (maximal slip forces, stiffness, and slip dynamics) with respect to their governing parameters (corrugation energy, effective stiffness, and damping). While common understanding in nanotribology relates the effect of surrounding media mainly to the interaction potential at the contact, here we show that the media can also greatly affect the elastic interaction, and consequently play an important role on the transition from single to multiple stick-slip.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

Rehabilitation process is usually monotonous, requires a lot of dedication and is just not attractive for patients, while allowing physiotherapists to assess the progression of the process qualitatively only. Used in traditional physical rehabilitation methods of obtaining quantitative data can be insufficient to objectively evaluate if any improvement has been achieved or changes in rehabilitation program must be made. Purpose Virtual reality (VR) technology is becoming a trending solution for said inconveniences and problems, allowing patients to become immersed in an entertaining, unreal world while still performing rehabilitative tasks and receiving immediate feedback on progress that is being made. Authors aim to establish trends in development of VR using systems used for enhancing rehabilitation of balance maintaining ability, which will make it easier for physiotherapists to pick suitable equipment, and for companies creating rehabilitation equipment to create devices with greater potential of being a successful inventions. Material and Methods Authors reviewed 110 publications found in databases of Pubmed, Researchgate, Mendeley (prior to version 1.19.8) and Google Scholar. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria 23 publications were put into further considerations. Results and Conclusions Reviewed systems were classified into 3 groups and analyzed. 15 publications were created using more simple, market available systems, 5 were using custom-made devices and 3 made use of highly advanced and not-easily accessible systems. Trends in development of VR using rehabilitation devices have been established in favour of more simple, but easily accessible systems.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Computational Intelligence']"

Current directions for balance rehabilitation require the inclusion of virtual reality (VR) tools as a complementary robotic tool to conventional physical therapies to accelerate balance recovery. This works aims to present the design and validation on healthy of a wearable and fully immersive VR-based tool following a user-centred design. This wearable VR tool comprises four Activities of Daily Living-based virtual challenges including nine motor tasks, chosen according to those most performed in the literature, as well as in the tasks of the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Timed Up and Go (TUG) clinical tests. This system comprises wearable VR technology, providing multimodal feedback (visual, sonorous, and vibrotactile cues), and integrates wearable inertial sensors for real-time motor assessment. The system’s operability was validated with six healthy subjects executing BBS and TUG related motor tasks to assess balance performance after and before two training trials for each virtual challenge. The results showed statistically significant improvements regarding COM’ displacement and velocity during “Cooking” and “Watch Tv” games and after VR training. The VR-based tool was rated with high IPQ and IMI scores. This wearable VR-based tool has the potential to effectively improve balance and walking, and to effectively increase the user’s active participation and enthusiasm during balance training; thus, contributing to accelerate the user’s balance and motor recovery.","['Engineering', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Robotics', 'Computational Intelligence']"

Therefore, this study aimed to quantify soil phosphorus balance at national level during the period 1950–2019, using the OECD approach. Phosphorus use efficiency is calculated only for arable land, as only it has received fertilizers. In cases of positive phosphorus balance, freshwater quality is endangered by eutrophication, while in cases of negative balance the yield of plants may decline. The results showed that for most of the study period (1970–2000), the phosphorus balance in Albania was positive, reaching a peak of about 22 kg/ha in 1990. During the period 2000–2019, the phosphorus balance returned in negative (about –3 and –9 kg/ha in 2010 and 2019, but significantly lower compared to 1950 (about –21.0 kg/ha). In terms of phosphorus deficit, Albania is included in the group of countries with the largest deficit compared to other EU countries (on average 1.7 times higher) and the OECD. The value of phosphorus use efficiency, as an average for the entire study period, was 23%, or about 3.7 times lower compared to the average value of this indicator in the EU-28, suggesting the immediate need to improve plant production practices including manuring. Data of this study can be used in the management of phosphorus sources to agricultural to increase production and protect the environment.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Agriculture', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences']"

The developments in this research field were motivated by some failure cases in the 19th century. The structural failure occurred even if the loading stresses were below the yield point of the material. The reason for that were the elevated temperatures resulting in creep behaviour of the structure. The first theories have been formulated as uniaxial equations with only a few parameters. Later, these equations were extended to three-dimensional equations, substituting the scalar stress and strain by their tensorial counterparts. In addition, for better comparison to one-dimensional results, equivalent statements for the applied stresses were introduced. Up to now, there is no creep mechanics theory which is as strict as continuum mechanics. However, there are many engineering theories through which more and more solutions for practical cases can be obtained. Below, a state of the art report of creep and damage mechanics for metallic materials and structures composed from these materials is given. Some remarks concerning the equivalent stress statements are added. In the further chapters, some parts of this contribution are extended.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Structural Materials', 'Classical and Continuum Physics']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-030-79827-7_39,en,Spherical Harmonics Expansion and Multi-Scale Modeling,OriginalPaper,"By far, most numerical device simulations are still based on the drift-diffusion (DD) model, owing to its versatility, numerical efficiency, and robustness. However, the DD model is of limited physical accuracy for nanoscale devices and hot carrier effects. Advanced physical modeling in the regime of semi-classical transport must therefore be based on the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), and the typical solution method for this equation is a Monte-Carlo (MC) algorithm owing to its small memory requirements. Unfortunately, this popular solution method makes the BTE model much less versatile than the DD approach, as, for example, no AC and noise analysis in the small-signal framework based on the Jacobian of the numerical model is available if the MC method is used. Moreover, evaluating the complete transport of carriers in a device by the BTE model is always several orders of magnitude less efficient in terms of CPU time than the application of the DD model. Thus, there is a clear demand to increase the versatility of the BTE model and to enhance the physical accuracy of the DD model without compromising its numerical efficiency and robustness. Solving the BTE model with the spherical harmonic expansion (SHE) method allows the calculation of the full Jacobian of the discrete system and to establish AC and noise analysis in the small-signal framework, thus making the BTE model much more versatile. Moreover, sequential and concurrent multi-scale methods using microscopic models such as the BTE model where necessary and macroscopic models such as the DD model otherwise are well suited to enhancing the physical accuracy of the DD model without compromising its efficiency and robustness. In addition, using the SHE method allows many of the discretization methods and principles previously developed for the DD model to be applied for the discretization of the BTE model. Therefore, a short overview of the historic development of discretization methods and principles, finally making the DD model as efficient and robust as it is today, is added as well.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Electronic Circuits and Devices', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation']"

As in many control systems, time delay sets limitation to performance during balancing tasks. Human subjects cannot balance an arbitrarily short stick on the fingertip, because a short stick falls faster than the time needed to make a corrective motion. Also, increased reaction time delay is one of the main reasons of instability during quiet standing, which can lead to falls especially among the elderly. The governing equation of the two models are second-order delay differential equations.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-17215-1_2,en,Effects of Organic Agriculture on the Soil Carbon Stock,OriginalPaper,"The soil carbon (C) stock is comprised of the soil inorganic carbon (SIC) and the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock. A site-specific steady state equilibrium soil C stock evolves under natural conditions depending on the balance between soil C inputs (plant residues) and losses (decomposition, erosion, leaching). The SIC stock is perceived as being less dynamic than the SOC stock with uncertain effects of organic agriculture (OA) on SIC sequestration rate, and not the focus of agricultural soil and land-use management. In contrast, the SOC stock receives increasing attention due to its importance for the global climate and soil health. However, increases in the SOC stock may also alter the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance and this must be addressed in the assessment of soil C sequestration practices to mitigate climate change. The historical loss of SOC due to the conversion of natural ecosystems to agroecosystems provides an opportunity to use soil and land-use management practices to partially replenish lost SOC stocks. Topsoil (0–15 cm depth) SOC stocks have been shown to increase under OA management by 1.98–3.50 Mg C ha −1 compared to nonorganic management. But the addition of exogenous C (e.g., with manure) for this improvement and SOC sequestration for climate change adaptation and mitigation may be important. Compared to nonorganic management, topsoil SOC sequestration rates did either not differ or were 0.29–0.45 Mg C ha −1  year −1 higher under OA, respectively. However, assessments of SOC sequestration and stocks for the entire rooted soil profile are scanty but needed to fully address long-term effects of agricultural management on SOC. Lower primary soil C inputs due to lower OA yields and higher losses by tillage compared to conventional no-tillage (NT) system may result in lower steady state equilibrium SOC stocks in OA systems. There is some evidence that root C allocation is higher under OA than that under nonorganic management. More agricultural soils will be managed in the future by OA driven by increasing consumer demand. The net effects of increased soil and land-use management for OA on the global soil C stocks must be critically assessed also in relation to long-term field experiments to support the design of climate-smart and climate resilient agroecosystems. Therefore, the objectives of this chapter are to describe in detail what processes and practices result in changes in SIC and SOC stocks and sequestration in soils under OA management.","['Life Sciences', 'Agriculture', 'Climate Change', 'Climate Change/Climate Change Impacts', 'Climate Change Management and Policy']"

The United States adopted offensive dominance, whereas Canada undertook an opportunistic foreign policy. However, the Afghan irregular warfare constituted a restrictive strategic environment that paved the way for both countries to operationalize their foreign and security policies as irregular warfare strategies.

Equal representation of women and men in politics was achieved in the national parliament of Sweden by 1994, a time when the international average in elected bodies at the national level had barely passed the threshold of 10% women. The current parliament, elected in 2018, consists of 46% women and 54% men and almost all of the political parties in parliament, to the left as well as to the right on the left–right ideological continuum, embrace the ideal of gender balance in decision-making bodies. Even in the populist Sweden Democrats, the proportion of elected women has increased. Sweden, at least at first glance, seems to be an exception to the rule that politics – and decision-making in general – is a man’s game.

We begin with an overview of the fundamentals of solar cell device operation, and the nature of the solar energy spectrum and light absorption in devices. We then go into detail of the basics of solar cell operation, and the effects of various factors on the primary figures of merit, the open circuit voltage, short circuit current, and fill factor. In particular we focus on recombination, both in terms of the photocurrent and the dark current affecting the cell voltage. We then discuss heterojunction solar cells, and the general concept of carrier selective structures, which improve solar cell performance. We summarize the main single junction technologies and their efficiencies historically, starting with Si wafer-based technology and GaAs, then thin film technology, and organic solar cells, ending with recent developments of hybrid perovskite-based solar cells. The limits of solar cell performance in terms of energy conversion efficiency are discussed, where we introduce the concept of detailed balance to derive the Shockley-Queisser limit for single junction cells. Methods of circumventing this single gap limit are discussed, which set the stage for discussing multijunction or tandem solar cells which currently hold the record for highest conversion efficiency in any solar technology. We then discuss nanotechnology in general, and how it is increasingly incorporated in modern solar cells. In this context, we discuss the use of nanostructures in improving light management in solar cells by enhancing light trapping beyond the classical limit. We discuss quantum dot/nanoparticle-based cells such as dye-sensitized solar cells and nanowire solar cells. Finally, we conclude by discussing advanced concept solar cell structures such as intermediate band, multiexciton generation, and hot carrier solar cells, and their theoretical capability of greatly exceeding the Shockley-Queisser limit.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Electronic Circuits and Devices', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation']"

However, climate change is expected to make extreme water shortage episodes more and more frequent. Forest is therefore more and more exposed to water stress. It appears necessary to quantify the drought induced by water deficit to evaluate forest vulnerability and to plan the future of forest management. In this study we quantified the 2018 water deficit experienced by the forest in the Strengbach catchment, located in the French Vosges mountains. Three methods for estimating catchment water storage changes (WSC) have been compared. The first relies on superconducting gravimeter monitoring while the second relies on catchment water balance. The third one relies on global hydrological model MERRA2. We show that WSC estimated from measured gravity changes correlate well with WSC estimated from catchment water balance while WSC inferred from MERRA2 significantly differs. The Strengbach catchment water cycle is mostly annual but exhibits significant interannual variability associated with the 2018 drought episode: August 2018 has a water deficit of 37 mm (as inferred from catchment water balance) or 76 mm (as seen with superconducting gravimetry) compared to August 2017. We illustrate here the use of superconducting gravimeter monitoring as an independent proxy for WSC in a mountainous catchment while most of hydro-gravimetric studies have been conducted on relatively flat areas. We therefore contribute to expand the area of use of high precision gravity monitoring for the hydrological characterization of the critical zone in mountainous context. This innovative method may help to assess forest vulnerability to drought in the context of climate change.","['Earth Sciences', 'Geophysics/Geodesy', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Remote Sensing/Photogrammetry']"

In the present study WetSpass model and GIS tools were used to determine water balance components’ temporal and spatial changes (surface runoff, actual evapotranspiration, and groundwater recharge) in the Sana watershed Kembata Tembaro Zone, Southern Ethiopia. In the current study, biophysical and hydro-meteorological parameters such as land use/cover, soil texture, elevation, and slope were included in the model. The data mentioned above sets were calibrated per the Wetspass model requirements. The spatial–temporal variation of the mean annual rainfall of 1358.6 mm was segmented into 20.6% (280 mm) of surface runoff (Qo), 59.76%(811.6 mm) of actual evapotranspiration, and 19.65% (267 mm) of water that annually recharges the groundwater system, according to the model results. The model's results show that the area's hydro-meteorological and biophysical variance controls the temporal and geographical variability of the catchment's water balance components.

The experimental model is a span-wise three-section force measuring model, and the force measure is only performed in the middle section of the model to reduce the influence of the sidewall interference of the wind tunnel. In the experiment, the transient angle of attack of the model is collected, the inertial force and pitching moment on the middle section of the model are calculated, and the data collected from the balance is subtracted to correct the influence of the model's inertia on the results. The results show that the angle of attack exceeding the positive or negative static stall angles of attack is a necessary condition for the lift and pitch moment coefficients to produce a large hysteresis loops. As the oscillation reduced frequency increases, the dynamic stall is delayed, the lift coefficient hysteresis loop increase, the drag coefficient increase, and the pitch moment coefficient near the maximum angle of attack decrease. When the angle of attack is less than the static angle of attack of stall or exceeds a small range, with the increase of the reduced frequency of the airfoil oscillation, the pitch moment coefficient of the airfoil decreases when it goes up and increases when it goes down. With the increase of the oscillation amplitude, the hysteresis loops of both dynamic lift coefficient and pitching moment coefficient of the oscillating airfoil increase. As the average angle of attack increases, the angle of attack of airfoil enters the positive stall zone more, the lift coefficient hysteresis loop increases, and the minimum pitch moment coefficient decreases. The Reynolds number has no obvious effect on the hysteresis loop of lift, drag and pitch moment coefficients; however, in the downward process, as the Reynolds number increases, the lift recovery advances, and the hysteresis loop decreases.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

For better understanding of the hydrodynamic processes in this type of coastal environment, a laboratory experiment was constructed with a 1:5 beach slope in a large wave basin. Obliquely incident irregular waves with a range of different statistical properties were generated at the offshore boundary to force the nearshore hydrodynamics, and spatially intensive wave and current measurements were collected across the beach. The beach is made of natural sand to achieve realistic bottom friction while the slope was periodically reset to original bathymetry to maintain a near-constant beach profile in all tests. Momentum was evaluated at cross-shore measurement sites inside and outside the surf zone to investigate the cross-shore transfer of alongshore wave momentum to the nearshore flows. This approach reveals that radiation stress gradients and cross-shore advection terms are dominant in the shoaling region. In the breaking region, the alongshore momentum exchange is mainly governed by the radiation stress gradients with a smaller contribution from cross-shore advection that relatively balances with the bottom friction and horizontal mixing terms. The alongshore momentum comes close to balancing across a relatively short distance on the steep beach, and the momentum across both the higher flux breaking region must be combined with the lower flux shoaling region for closure of the momentum balance. Overall the experimental results indicate the importance of the alongshore momentum flux from wave breaking to advection and mixing that extend outside the narrow breaking region on a steep beach.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Freshwater & Marine Ecology', 'Environmental Management', 'Coastal Sciences', 'Water and Health']"

Calls to explore this environment with growing number of projects and provide insights into more effective organizing have been made by managers, professional project management associations, and researcher community. Therefore, the research presented in this chapter serves the purpose of gaining insights into manifestation of projectification into work and life context. Specifically, it focuses on women top managers who encounter unique challenges in coping with projectification at their workplaces, as well as in their private life. Study is rooted in the ephemeralization perspective of the projectification and recognizes challenges of work-life intensification, while addressing the gaps in our understanding of experiences of women in top leadership positions. The findings substantiate the increasing projectification as experienced by women top managers, resulting in transformations of workplace spaces and increasing psychological pressure. More interestingly, it unveiled gendered tenets that due to projectification impact work and life of women top managers even in the most gender egalitarian country in the world, Iceland.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-17215-1_4,en,Biogeophysical and Biogeochemical Climate Effects of Organic Agriculture,OriginalPaper,"Agricultural practices regulate the climate by storing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) as soil carbon (C), and by affecting the exchange of the other greenhouse gases (GHGs) methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) between the land and the atmosphere. Often overlooked is, however, that agriculture also affects the climate by biogeophysical and biogeochemical mechanisms. This includes alterations in surface physical properties including those of soil and land-atmosphere energy exchange by changes in surface roughness, evaporation, transpiration, surface albedo, C density, and biogenic aerosols, i.e., biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). For example, aerosols which are small liquid and solid particles emitted into the atmosphere, have globally offset a substantial portion of GHG mean radiative forcing (RF). Annual global mean direct radiative effect of biogenic secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) has been estimated at between −0.08 W m −2 and − 0.78 W m −2 (net cooling). In comparison, the radiative forcing (RF) values for carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) have been estimated at +1.95, +0.62 and + 0.18 W m −2 , respectively (net warming). Organic agriculture (OA) crop rotations are characterized by a higher abundance of temporary fodders, catch- and cover-crops compared to conventional rotations. This is associated with longer crop rotations, and results in higher diversity and evener crop species distribution with ramifications for biogeophysical and biogeochemical regulation of the local climate. For example, surface albedo can increase by 0.06 when corn ( Zea mays L.; albedo 0.20–0.23) or soybean ( Glycine max L.; albedo 0.21) are replaced by sunflower ( Helianthus spp.; albedo 0.24–0.30), and air temperatures may be lower. However, knowledge about these effects on climate versus those by alterations in the exchange of GHG between land and atmosphere is scanty. Similarly, effects of OA on soil physical properties including erosion are understudied. The biogeophysical and biogeochemical climate effects must be studied in detail to more thoroughly address long-term effects of OA practices on the local, regional and global climate as more land will be managed by OA practices in the future.","['Life Sciences', 'Agriculture', 'Climate Change', 'Climate Change/Climate Change Impacts', 'Climate Change Management and Policy']"

The conventional mobility load-balancing (MLB) algorithms consider only the contiguous neighboring cells and do not expand enough performance of the network, while other MLB algorithms consider the neighboring cells of the total network experienced unneeded MLB actions. The proposed load-balancing algorithm studies overloaded cells and neighbors using the proposed efficiency parameter. To begin with and to identify the overloaded cells, we propose an efficiency factor B that compares a pre-defined threshold and the network threshold to control the algorithm triggering by modifying the CIO parameters of the cluster cells in both medium-loaded and overloaded cells triggering in both medium-loaded and overloaded cells. Then, to control the distribution, we propose a method to shift only a portion of the serving cells load, so the target cell load after handover always be equal to or less than B . In a low UE speed scenario, the simulation results showed a lower standard deviation (SD) by 19.99% and enhanced throughput by 7.355%.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Statistics, general']"

The main environmental effects that could affect the built environment (e.g., temperature, hydraulic balance, etc.) are also analyzed in terms of the power spectrum and spectral entropy. The main frequencies associated with both environmental data and remote displacements are highlighted.

In this study, different from existing strategies to alleviate the data imbalance issue, a novel mechanism based on the CutMix regularization technique is proposed for imbalanced image classification. The novelty is from two aspects. First, a novel sampling strategy is proposed to create the synthetic training data with a more balanced distribution. Second, labels of synthetic images were assigned with a bias toward minority classes. With the novel sampling and label assignment, more synthetic images of minority classes can be obtained to balance the class distribution of training data.

In addition, new equipment, such as phase shifters, will also be needed in electrical transmission systems to upgrade the grid. A central role in future GES will be attributed to energy storage facilities, which can naturally balance the temporal offset between supply and demand.

Monsoon rainfall/snowmelt mainly contributes to streamflow in low/high altitude regions. In contrast, middle altitude streamflow is mainly sustained by both snowmelt and rainfall contribution. The study reveals that temperature and precipitation variations are translated into hydrologic regime’s changes of Beas by way of increase/decrease in seasonal/annual snowmelt/glaciermelt runoff, rainfall runoff and streamflow. An increased warming trend and decline in precipitation result in early snowmelt and decreased streamflow. Annual total runoff decreasing trend mainly dominated by reduced snowmelt runoff (75%)/rainfall runoff (64%) in high/low altitude region. In contrast, rainfall runoff (61%) and snowmelt runoff (54%) principally contribute to the declining total runoff trend in the middle altitude region. Accelerated glaciermelt due to warming trends has a non-significant impact on streamflow variability. The uncertainty of future water availability and loss of snow/glacier reserve is an essential consideration for the water security of Beas.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics']"

This decline in performance can be avoided by minimizing these variations with the help of a control system. However, the conventional control system used by a boiler accounts for a significant time lag which in turn affects the performance negatively. Hence, in this study, predictive models of water level and pressure developed using mass and energy balance equations of the boiler are presented, which can be utilized in minimizing these variations by determining the fluctuations beforehand. The predictions made by these models can be used in adjusting the inputs such as feedwater rate and fuel input rate to avoid the impending changes in pressure and water level. The concept of multivariate regression has been implemented in developing these models that have an average error of 0.0243% in water level predictions and 8.0525% in pressure predictions. This regression algorithm deals with a water level range of 64.525%, pressure range of 0.467 MPa, and steam load range of 70%.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics']"

The comparison facilitates an evaluation of the accuracy of nonlinear, periodic responses computed with HBM, specifically by comparing super- and subharmonic resonances, regions of periodic and nonperiodic (i.e., quasiperiodic or chaotic) responses, and discontinuity-induced bifurcations, such as grazing bifurcations. Convergence analysis of HBM determines the appropriate number of harmonics required to capture nonlinear contact behavior, while satisfying the governing equations.

This is evident by the 2.5 quintillions of data generated by persons connected to the Internet per day in 2020. With the expectation of 5.3 billion Internet users by 2023, complex and efficient tools, models, or approaches that will explore, analyze, and produce meaningful hidden information from huge data are needed. In recent years, machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, and clustering are beginning to gain relevance, especially in churn prediction. Customer churn prediction is the process of determining the proportion of clients who avoid or might stop using or subscribing to a product or service offered by an organization or company. Though various prediction models have been proposed, most research attention has been given to measuring the efficiency of prediction models, rather than identifying its application for sustainable economic development. In this paper, we investigate the determining factor for customer attrition in the banking sector using Power BI. Dataset from United Bank of Africa (UBA), Nigeria was preprocessed with four key customer variables were used. The decision tree algorithm available in the Power Bi software was employed for training and testing. The results show that customer account balance is a key determining variable for churning. Furthermore, the results show that churning occurs less in male than female clients. This work will provide banks with useful knowledge on building effective customer retention strategies. Building an effective and accurate customer churn prediction model is an important research problem for both academics and practitioners.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Mobile and Network Security', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Thus, the definition of climate protection goals led to an increasing number of photovoltaic installations worldwide in recent years. At the same time, especially urban areas are already suffering from the consequences of climate change: Heat waves during summer months and reduced night-time cooling lead to negative impacts on the human organism and health. Within this context, the present review investigates interdependencies arising between photovoltaic panels and outdoor thermal microclimate, particularly in urban areas. In a first explorative, then systematic literature research approach, relevant publications were identified and selected based on distinct criteria. The studies were classified into the following main categories: (i) impacts of photovoltaics on the thermal microclimate; (ii) impacts of thermal microclimate on photovoltaic performance. The literature is then accordingly analyzed and main interdependencies, parameters and metrics are identified. The results, however, are incongruent, reaching in category (i) from ‘solar cooling’ of the surrounding ambient air temperature of up to −1.8 K to ‘solar heating’ of up to 4 K. Hence, further research, both experimental and simulation Simulation -based, is required to comprehensively understand the interactions between photovoltaics and its thermal surroundings.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Sustainable Development']"

Using a systematic approach, these transport models are derived from the semiclassical Boltzmann equation by applying the method of moments. The drift-diffusion model is based on the first two moments of the Boltzmann equation, while hydrodynamic and energy transport models consider three or four moments. Within the framework of the diffusion approximation, the convective terms in the hydrodynamic models can be neglected, resulting in the much simpler diffusive energy transport models. A discussion of the physical assumptions needed for the validity of these models is given. In cases where the energy distribution is insufficiently described by a heated Maxwellian distribution, energy transport models give poor results. Based on the diffusion approximation, a six-moment model generalizing the energy transport model is presented. All model parameters can be extracted from fullband bulk Monte Carlo simulations. The six-moment model is applied for the simulation of devices with channel length in the deca-nanometer regime. Short-channel and hot-carrier effects for which the heated Maxwellian assumption introduces particularly large errors are studied. Comparing all models, it is demonstrated that the six-moment model can improve on the drift-diffusion and energy transport models.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Electronic Circuits and Devices', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation']"

How this microscopic-macroscopic interaction occurs is poorly understood, as researchers frequently examine models within particular ranges of abstraction and scale. Computational neuroscience and machine learning models offer theoretically powerful analyses of plasticity in neural networks, but results are often siloed and only coarsely linked to biology. In this review, we examine connections between these areas, asking how network computations change as a function of diverse features of plasticity and vice versa. We review how plasticity can be controlled at synapses by calcium dynamics and neuromodulatory signals, the manifestation of these changes in networks, and their impacts in specialized circuits. We conclude that metaplasticity—defined broadly as the adaptive control of plasticity—forges connections across scales by governing what groups of synapses can and can’t learn about, when, and to what ends. The metaplasticity we discuss acts by co-opting Hebbian mechanisms, shifting network properties, and routing activity within and across brain systems. Asking how these operations can go awry should also be useful for understanding pathology, which we address in the context of autism, schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Psychiatry', 'Neurosciences', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Biological Psychology']"

As the users’ requests are of enormous magnitude, it manifests as overloaded physical machines resulting in quality of service degradation and SLA violations. This challenge can be negotiated by exercising a better virtual machine allocation by dint of re-allocating a subset of active virtual machines at a suitable destined server by virtual machine migration. It is exhibited as improved resource utilization with enhanced energy efficiency along with addressing the challenge of impending server overloading resulting in downgraded services. The aforesaid twin factors of enhanced energy consumption and enhanced resource utilization can be suitably addressed by combining them together as a single objective function by utilizing cost function based best-fit decreasing heuristic. It enhances the potentials for aggressively migrating large capacity applications like image processing, speech recognition, and decision support systems. It facilitates a seamless and transparent live virtual machine migration from one physical server to another along with taking care of cloud environment resources. The identification of most appropriate migration target host is executed by applying modified version of best-fit decreasing algorithm with respect to virtual machine dynamic migration scheduling model. By executing the selection algorithm, the hotspot hosts in cloud platform are segregated. Subsequently, virtual machine-related resource loads are identified in descending order with respect to hotspots. The resource loads pertaining to non-hotspot hosts are identified in ascending order.

Transition to the market economy of Albania has increased the vulnerability especially for two categories: the youngest, as the new entries into the labour market, and the oldest workers, who found it difficult to be adjusted to the labour market demand, after the failure of state enterprises, changes in working environments, social services, family, etc. The investigation of older workers in the labour market is focused on five dimensions: (1) the labour market structure and employment status of older workers; (2) the employment & VET policies; (3) the work-life balance with ageing; (4) health and (5) retirement. In the beginning of 1990s, the early retirement was the first policy intervention to cope with massive unemployment of older workers. Then, the parametric reforms of PAYG social insurance for increasing the retirement ages and the insurance period have had an impact on extending the working life of older workers of 10 years until 2018. However, the replacement rate was lowering from 74.2% in 1990, to 56% in 1993 when reform started, to further 41% in 2018 which impose pensioners to continue working or delaying the retirement. The increased youth unemployment, atypical and informal employment, has been new challenges for older workers to be adjusted to the labour market demand and only 10% of them can continue working after the retirement age. The development of employment services, VET, health care and social protection have been inadequate to promote social inclusion of older workers. In the framework of the EU integration, Albania has pursued a process of harmonization the legal framework with EU standards. National strategies have been enacted to guarantee human rights, gender equality, and an inclusive society. The social inclusion of older workers into the labour market is a complex issue that depended not only of the Government interventions, but also by the active engagement of other stakeholders. In the Albanian tradition family continues to be a strong supporting institution for older people and children, very likely to the Abbado’s idea in Italy. This chapter is based on an analysis of policy documents, research and statistics from INSTAT, Eurostat, World Bank, etc. The Eurofound’s European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) 2015, and European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) 2016 are used to identify age and gender patterns regarding work-life balance and social inclusion. The analysis suggests that to fully address the complexity of the inclusion of older workers in the labour market, an integrated approach should involve all relevant policy areas such as education, health, employment, and social protection, as well as engagement of all community stakeholders.","['Social Sciences', 'Life course', 'Labor Economics', 'Aging', 'Social Structure, Social Inequality', 'Sociology of Work']"

Proposed method for estimating the impact of uneven electricity consumption on the level of losses in LPSS in contrast to the existing ones, uses modified Frieze Q F power decomposition indicators and common determinations of Frieze Q F power for an arbitrary time interval, which considers the influence of uneven power levels on electricity consumption, as well as k Δ opt , which characterizes the efficiency of regulation and determines the level of suboptimal energy transfer in terms of eliminating its losses.

Motor symptoms, such as tremors, gait changes, and bradykinesia, emerge due to loss of neurons in the basal ganglia of the deep brain. No simple, specific, quantifiable, and readily available test exists to aid the diagnosis of these conditions. Clinical examination remains the gold standard, yet this relies on subjective assessments of symptom severity. Invasive tests including analysis of blood and cerebrospinal fluid have been disappointing. However, thanks to novel technology we now have the ability to quantify motor disturbances accurately, from finger movements and tremors to saccadic eye movements and gait. Improvements in computational power and battery life have enabled sensors to become smaller whilst ever more precise. Motor biomarkers are non-invasive and therefore well suited to longitudinal, remote, monitoring. For these reasons, over the last decade, there has been a shift from focusing solely on invasive biomarkers to a greater emphasis on non-invasive motor markers. In this chapter we introduce two examples of neurological conditions which are the subject of active motor biomarker research and describe some of the digital phenotyping methods being applied to these disorders. In addition, we outline future developments including remote testing and contactless testing.

For these repetitive projects, existing scheduling formulation integrates CPM network analysis with the line-of-balance (LOB) analysis. Despite the CPM/LOB benefits in determining the necessary crews that meet a given deadline, however, CPM/LOB formulation has a serious drawback as it underestimates the number of crews and can result in a project delay although the deadline is relaxed. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes an improvement method that modifies the project deadline to avoid creating schedules that lead to project delays, while keeping resource usage at an optimal value. The paper introduces two variations of the CPM/LOB formulation for shifted and parallel crew arrangements and uses an example to highlight the deadline satisfaction problem. The paper then introduces the detailed formulation of the proposed solution and demonstrates its effectiveness.

Models can also be used by greenhouse designers, as different build options can be compared to ensure optimal design decisions. The cost of installing new technologies and equipment is often high: simulations can be used to provide a good estimate of the potential impact specific systems will have before investing in costly greenhouse infrastructure. This paper documents the development and validation of a thermal energy model designed to simulate the microclimate of a greenhouse based on site properties, exterior conditions, greenhouse operating protocols and heat and mass transfer relationships. A dynamic lumped capacitance model approach was used. Due to the large variety of greenhouse types and equipment, the main objective was to test the predictive performance of the model at various greenhouse sites, ranging from a small backyard greenhouse to large, more complex commercial operations. Measured timeseries data was obtained for each site, either from field studies conducted by the research team or from logged greenhouse controller data supplied by commercial greenhouse operators. Various greenhouse elements common in commercial operations, such as supplemental heating and lighting, forced and passive ventilation, evaporative cooling pads, and dehumidification equipment, are found in some of the test sites, and all are incorporated into the model. The studied greenhouses are all located in southern Ontario, Canada (42.0 °N, 82.8 °W to 43.2 °N, 79.4 °W). This region is characterized as a humid, continental climate with four recognizable seasons (summer, fall, winter and spring). The model was tested with data from each season, since the regional industry is moving towards year-round production. The accuracy of the model results are quantified by using the root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) between measured and simulated values for each test case. The accuracy of greenhouse air temperature and humidity predictions compared favorably with examples in the literature for lumped parameter greenhouse models for all greenhouse sites and seasons simulated. The results support the conclusion that the model is sufficiently accurate to be used as a design tool for growers and greenhouse designers.","['Energy', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Environmental and Sustainability Education', 'Sustainable Development', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Natural Resource and Energy Economics']"

This is followed by a review of current waste treatment technologies for three broad groups of waste materials, namely: Municipal solid waste materials Industrial waste materials Low-level radioactive waste materials In each of these groups, attention is given to the unique role thermal plasma technology can play for the safe and reliable treatment of the waste material and niche opportunities for the recovery of valuable products from the waste. In a field as vast and diversified as waste treatment, it is unrealistic to attempt to treat it in an exhaustive manner in a single chapter. Emphasis is therefore given to providing typical examples of some of the leading technologies developed over the past few decades with adequate references for further information.","['Engineering', 'Materials Engineering', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Plasma Physics']"

The feats of human creativity and innovation provide our conspecifics too much to marvel at and feel proud of what human civilization has achieved in the course of its evolution down the ages. However, despite all our technological sophistications, we have failed to achieve this glory without compromising the ecological balance of nature. The ecological fallout of anthropogenic activities makes us ponder over the drawbacks inherent in man-made technologies. From this perspective, insects emerge as serious competitors to man because their intriguing evolutionary history is a unique success story which saw their domination in all habitats and resulted in their unprecedented diversity without disturbing the environment and its delicate balance. This is such a remarkable thing that tempts us to learn a lot from insects and come up with novel, environment-friendly, and more efficient technologies. Many branches of life sciences such as genetics, molecular biology, developmental biology, and chronobiology have benefitted so much from the studies on insects that insect models have become indispensable for their growth. Interestingly, insects have been an inspiration behind many of the technological advancements of our contemporary world. The fields of aviation and architecture owe a lot to insects for some of the bizarre designs and out-of-box ideas. Over the past few decades, there has been a significant rise in the application of insects for achieving technological breakthroughs. Materials science is coming forward as a major beneficiary of insect-derived substances with interesting properties which find application in various industries and are appearing in a large variety of useful products. Further, the movement patterns of insects are leading to innovations in robotics and prosthesis. The present review takes a closer look at the uses of insects in the growth of science and technology. It gives a bird-eye-view of the major developments in insect-inspired breakthroughs in basic sciences and their applications in technology and is expected to grab the attention of entomologists and technocrats alike.

Based on the theoretical premise of performance enhancing-organizational ambidexterity, we tested the hypothesis that improved performance results from the fit between agile and lean capabilities. The deviation score approach (matching perspective) and fit as profile deviation were used to examine the performance-enhancing fit of lean (quality and delivery) and agile (flexibility and innovation)-related capabilities. The deviation score method did not reveal a significant relationship between misfit and profit. In contrast, the misfit and sales revenue growth rates were positively and significantly related, albeit not in the expected direction. The profile deviation strategic fit perspective revealed a nonsignificant negative relationship between non-adherence to the ideal profile and profit within the specific range of profile deviation. The current study relied on fit as matching and profile deviation, which denotes the combining approach of ambidexterity. Further research may thus broaden our understanding of the performance implications of lean-agile template compatibility, most notably conceptualizing the fit as an ambidexterity-related balancing approach in the pursuit of optimal levels of lean and agile capability configurations.","['Business and Management', 'Production', 'Operations Management', 'Business and Management, general', 'Industrial Organization', 'Business Process Management']"

It helps to perform computation locally in a fog server instead of doing it in a distant centralized cloud platform. Due to heavy load at cloud servers which is the result of too much centralization leads to adverse effects on several real-time issues like load balancing, automated service provisioning, fault tolerance, traffic overload, resource utilization, power/energy consumption and response time, etc. It is difficult to manage and processing load for the edge computing nodes in fog environment. Dynamic energy efficient-based Load balancing is still a major issue for the full-scale realization of fog computing in many application domains. The suggested system must assign appropriate workload amongst all the fog or edge nodes in order to effectively increase network performance, minimize delay, and reduce energy consumption owing to network traffic occurring at cloud servers. In this present approach, primarily the user will transmit an incoming task to the Tasks Manager for execution. The available resources can be arranged by the Scheduler according to their usage. The Resource Compute Engine gets task and resource information from the Scheduler and resources are allotted to the task based on organized list and also transmit the result to the user. When compared to the existing dynamic load balancing method, the suggested methodology is more effective for fog computing settings in terms of minimizing overall energy usage and computational cost by 8.78% and 16.78%, respectively.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Mobile and Network Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data']"

The appearance of pilot-industrial projects to apply mechanisms of faster heat transfer (radiant mechanism) or without influence in the molecules that form the gas (heating of the steel by induction heat transfer) is more and more frequent. In all the cases, the physical–chemical characteristics of the atmospheres that are in contact with the steel have influence on the changes that can be produced on the surface of the steel that is being processed. On many occasions, as we are talking about large productions (millions of tons), it is not the objective to avoid the surface oxidation, which involves important metallurgical losses. The high operation and energy costs that can involve an atmosphere that could avoid the oxidation do not compensate the metallurgical losses associated with the oxidation.

This model consists of two ODEs—for private consumption and for capital intensity, both are related to labour input in efficiency units. A positive (strongly destabilizing) second-order feedback loop connects these variables. M-1 possesses a saddle stationary state. Linearized M-1 has a saddle path that is allegedly stable optimal solution gained through the Pontryagin maximum principle with an initial private consumption as a jump variable. An existence of such a non-resilient saddle path is practically excluded in M-1. This utter instability leads to typical outcomes outside a viable region: the first with complete destruction of fixed production assets, the second with usage of asymptotically 100% of net output for accumulation of fixed production assets. This unsound model should be not included in realistic models for avoiding wrong economic and climate projections as well as heavy policy risks.

The results show that when C/P changes from 36 to 109, the removal effect of chemical oxygen demand (COD) is small, and the removal rates of ammonia nitrogen (NH4±N) and total phosphorus (TP) show an increasing trend. The highest removal rates of COD, NH4±N, and TP are 93.1%, 51.1%, and 72.4%, respectively. The content of phosphorus in the biofilm was higher than that in the suspended sludge, and the content of phosphorus in the attached biofilm and exfoliated biofilm was higher under higher C/P conditions. In the biofilm, the content of inorganic phosphorus was significantly higher than that of organic phosphorus, which accounted for 75.43%–92.67% of TP, and non-apatite inorganic phosphorus accounted for 44.93%–65.69% of TP. The content of phosphorus in the attached biofilm was significantly higher than that in the exfoliated biofilm, and the phosphorus in the system was in a state of dynamic balance, and the amount of phosphorus treated was equal to the content of phosphorus in the discharged biofilm.

The main assumption, to be explored and defended further here, is that plausible accounts of well-being must hold these conflicting experiences in tension to sustain and enhance well-being. Moreover, examining this tension, opens up further debate concerning how well-being is best promoted. For example, these conflicting experiences do not necessarily imply that a person should pursue ‘balance’ in her life to enhance her well-being, experiencing, say, roughly equivalent amounts of unconscious absorption and self-conscious critical reflection. Instead, it suggests that a person should ‘attune’ her life to the idiosyncratic and conflicting ontological characteristics of who she is, which may, or may not, include pursuing this kind of ‘balanced life’. Attunement reflects the very particularised and unique expressions of this person, and how she is leading her life, with the ‘valued objects’ she pursues also often being incommensurable and therefore largely incomparable. More broadly, recognising this kind of incommensurability also generates normative conflicts concerning how well-being is best understood and promoted in social policy and welfare practice. Subsequently, the conflicts and tensions implied in this deeply pluralist understanding of well-being, allows for multi-layered and rich experiences of well-being. The resulting variety and complexity of these experiences need to be fully accommodated when promoting well-being in social policy and welfare practice. Finally, in the concluding remarks, a summary is made of the principal assertions defended in the book, and its defence of what is called here, The Ontology of Well-Being Thesis (TOWT).","['Philosophy', 'Political Philosophy', 'Employee Health and Wellbeing', 'Social Policy', 'Politics of the Welfare State', 'Social Work and Community Development', 'Comparative Social Policy']"

Numerous investigators have focused on exploring various nonlinear sources, such as nonlinear material definition, different types of crack motion, de-boding, etc. In particular, the nonlinear crack motion continues to be very attractive to investigated due to lack of precise distinction about its impact on the generated higher-order harmonics and/or side harmonics. Furthermore, it was shown in the literature that this type of nonlinearity has the highest impact on the generated nonlinear wave components. Thus, in this paper, the nonlinear shear motion between the crack interfaces is taken into consideration. First, the analytical solution is prepared based on the Coulomb’s friction model, in which the low-frequency modulation of the normal force to cracks interface is assumed. Solution is obtained using the Harmonic Balance method. Next, the results are validated through the experimental investigation, confirming the choice of the model.

A decentralized and distributed ledger was developed to provide a certain amount of privacy and security for an election by removing any type of tampering. Furthermore, cryptographic principles and a consensus protocol were used to ensure the legitimacy and legality of each transaction, making it safe and thereby strengthening the election process. Every vote cast by a voter through our website is added to the blockchain as a transaction, and the voter is represented by a single unique address allocated to him or her for voting. The proposed mechanism’s performance in terms of security, privacy, and scalability reveals that it reduces interference that could taint the integrity of a fair election.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Computer Communication Networks', 'Computational Intelligence']"

To get control of finances, it is essential that clinical leaders understand the basics of hospital financing, and are up to date on key metrics, which include clinical activity data, numbers of employees and material costs. These insights should be used to take action whenever financial result is not according to budget plans. This chapter discusses and presents practical advice on how to take control over finances. The chapter also discusses hospital financing in a society perspective and reviews OECD data, which show that current trends in hospital expenses are not sustainable. The chapter gives insights into what are the major inefficiencies in hospital services and suggests how society should meet the challenges. Traditional as well as novel methods for hospital financing, such as value-based payment and bundled payment, are discussed. The chapter also discusses what should be expected from good clinical leaders when it comes to handling financial challenges and what their superior should expect. The chapter explains the importance of attitude for becoming a good leader, and how wrong attitude and disloyalty can make leaders unsuitable for their job.","['Business and Management', 'Health Care Management', 'Organization', 'Business Strategy/Leadership', 'Practice and Hospital Management']"

A second-order finite volume flow solver was used to conduct flow simulations around the aircraft. The distributed ducted fans were modeled by applying different boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet of the ducts. Three different geometric models, namely, clean airframe configuration (C1), airframe with a boundary layer ingestion (BLI) fan system (C2), and airframe with a non-BLI fan system (C3), were created to analyze the impact of the BLI fan system on the aerodynamic characteristics of the blended-wing-body aircraft. Then, the aerodynamic performance of these configurations was examined at three design points, namely, climb, cruise, and glide. A comparison of C1 and C3 showed that the installation of the distributed ducted fan system increased the total airframe dissipation in the glide condition. A comparison of the total airframe dissipation of C2 and C3 in the cruise condition revealed that considerable aerodynamic performance improvement was generated by the BLI effects. The aerodynamic performance of the low-speed, blended-wing-body aircraft was sensitive to the installation position of the ducted fan system. The findings of this study provide useful insights into the design of distributed ducted propulsion systems.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

Due to this reason, this work has presented different methods of data analysis to compare dysarthria severity and healthy speech followed by the classification. The comparisons have been done based on the articulatory part of TORGO, a publicly dysarthric speech dataset. This study mainly compared the three-dimensional space, the tongue pronunciation range skewness, and the articulatory pronunciation time between dysarthria speech severity and control speech. In machine learning, the classification of the pathological database is important to diagnose the disease. However, the misclassification of the traditional algorithm on the data with more than two classes, worst when the sample numbers between classes are imbalanced is high. Due to that problem, a method is proposed in this paper by adopting both principal component analysis (PCA) and cost-sensitive (CS) with the J48 decision tree to reduce the misclassification and solve imbalanced data. The result of the proposed method both in overall accuracy and recall outperformed the original J48. This method is also compared against the two other imbalanced classification methods where it showed the best accuracy.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Engineering Acoustics', 'Mathematics in Music', 'Music']"

It is with no surprise that over the past century, this paradigm has led to an increase in the incidence and prevalence of several noncommunicable chronic diseases, including obesity, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and the special focus of this chapter, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), in which the lipid and inflammatory profiles play a major role in the pathophysiology. In the following sections, we will provide an insight on how the lipid and inflammatory profiles are related to the pathophysiology of T2DM and shed some light on how acute and chronic exercise can impact and ameliorate the metabolic dysfunction in T2DM individuals . In the first section, we will address the relationship of the lipid biomarkers with both obesity and T2DM by examining the classic pathophysiology of dyslipidemia, while going into further detail on the organ-crosstalk among the adipose tissue, muscle, and liver. At the muscle level, we will highlight the interrelationships between intramyocellular lipids and lipid intermediates and the development of muscle insulin resistance, whereas, at the liver, we will discuss how intrahepatic lipids are a strong lipid biomarker capable of predicting hepatic insulin resistance and other obesity-related complications. We will then connect how acute and chronic exercise can impact these aforementioned lipid biomarkers through a mechanistic approach, as well as provide a detailed review of the most recent results from randomized controlled trials (RCT) on the classic, clinically used lipid biomarkers (e.g., low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides). In the second section, we will review the link between adipose tissue dysfunction and chronic low-grade inflammation in both obesity and T2DM, while taking a closer look at the inflammatory biomarkers that have been mostly studied in the exercise physiology field and that have been implicated in the pathophysiology of T2DM. Finally, and following the same trend as the first section on lipid biomarkers, we will discuss the impact of acute and chronic exercise on the inflammatory milieu and review the most recent RCT investigations, while focusing on the impact of certain exercise characteristics, such as the duration, intensity, and type of intervention.","['Biomedicine', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Pharmacology/Toxicology']"

The CoNiCrAlY coating was prepared by low pressure plasma spraying (LPPS) and was characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). It exhibited a two-phase structure, consisting of a fcc γ-Ni phase and a bcc β-NiAl secondary phase. The as-sprayed CoNiCrAlY coatings were subjected to isothermal oxidation at 1100 °C. An analytical approach was proposed to estimate the β-phase depletion behaviour from the oxide growth kinetics via mass balance conversions. In addition, the growth of mixed oxides (including spinel oxides and alumina) on the rough and flat surfaces in the as-sprayed condition were considered. It was shown that the calculated β-phase depletion agreed well with the experimental measurements.

Modelling the dynamic behaviour of bolted joint contact interfaces is one of the most challenging tasks in structural dynamics. The multi-frequency response of nonlinear systems, particularly bolted joint structures, is an important characteristic for the model identification of such structures. The alternating frequency-time approach using a harmonic balance (AFTHB) is used in this study to identify the nonlinear model of the bolted joint of the Brake-Reuß beam. Vibration tests with harmonic excitation were performed over a range of frequencies to measure the dynamic response of the structure. The two beams of the structure are modelled using Timoshenko beam theory. A model selection procedure using the measured data is applied to a range of candidate models to model the dynamics of the joint contact interface. The AFTHB approach is then applied to estimate the unknown parameters of the assumed nonlinear model of the structure utilizing the experimentally measured data. The estimated parameters are used to reconstruct the measured dynamic response of the structure.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Automotive Engineering']"

The selected parameters of the kinematics of the upper limbs’ movements during exercises with the Neuroforma system were compared with the kinematics of the movement of selected activities used in daily living. The reference group consisted of 17 adults without any musculoskeletal disorders. For the reference group, studies of the kinematics of the movement of the upper limbs were carried out using the Xsens system. Tasks performed during these activities included actions such as drinking from a cup or lifting an object on a platform. The study of the kinematics of movement of selected cognitive-motor exercises (“Paths”, “Track”) with the Neuroforma system was carried out for one healthy adult. It has been shown that the maximum value of angles and ranges of motion in the shoulder and elbow joints during exercise in the Neuroforma system is higher than in the analyzed everyday activities. Moreover, the values of the analyzed kinematic parameters do not increase linearly with the increase made in the levels of the analyzed exercises. The type and level of exercise in the system should be selected by the doctor/physiotherapist individually on the basis of the patient’s mobility capabilities, based on medical knowledge and a biomechanical assessment of movements made for specific exercises and their levels.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Computational Intelligence']"

Green hydrogen could be a platform molecule to electrify and decarbonize the system, linking different energy sectors while increasing their operational flexibility. This chapter reviews the latest advances on hydrogen generation from ethanol via application of the phenomenon of electrochemical promotion of catalysis (EPOC). Due to the well-known promotional effects of alkali metals in heterogeneous catalysts for reforming and partial oxidation reactions, our investigations focused on the use of K-βAl 2 O 3 solid electrolyte as the electro-active support of a Pt catalyst. The supply of K + under negative polarization steps strongly increased hydrogen production rates showing a reversible and controllable promotional effect in all cases. Comparing the three atmospheres (reforming, partial oxidation, and autothermal reforming) under EPOC conditions, it seems that autothermal reforming is the most suitable one. It combines both reaction routes achieving a compromise between hydrogen production and catalyst stability. All these results demonstrated the interest of the phenomenon application in ethanol conversion reactions, improving hydrogen production as well as catalyst stability.","['Chemistry', 'Catalysis', 'Electrochemistry', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering', 'Materials Science, general']"

At the micro, individual level, values alignment can become a point of contention in personal interactions of pediatricians with their patients and their families, or while navigating challenges pertaining to work-life balance. At the meso, institutional level, values alignment can be threatened by administrative pressures and dissonance between personal and organizational values. Finally, macro, structural level challenges to values alignment stem from policies and the cultural contexts that pediatricians work within. Our overall goal in this chapter is to demonstrate that while values alignment is primarily experienced at the personal level, it is largely shaped by organizational and socio-cultural factors that extend far beyond pediatricians’ control. We also provide recommendations on how values alignment can be facilitated to promote well-being among pediatricians.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Pediatrics']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-15780-6_10,en,"Republicanism, Democracy and History",OriginalPaper,"Modern republican theory as presented by Philip Pettit and Quentin Skinner rests upon a particular set of interpretations of the history of political thought. In particular, it is claimed, Hobbes’s redefinition of liberty as the absence of interference, subsequently taken up by Bentham and other utilitarian and liberal theorists, eclipsed the older republican notion in which the freedom of citizens was necessarily tied to the freedom of the state of which they were members. This liberal account of liberty is then contrasted with the more democratic republican account, in which political participation is intrinsically linked to freedom from mastery. However, the historiography of this claim proves problematic. On the one hand, it overlooks the prominent role played by utilitarian and liberal assumptions and principles in the democratic arguments of philosophic radicals in the nineteenth century. On the other hand, it involves excluding Rousseau and Kant, central figures in the continental republican tradition, from the republican canon because of the way they drew on Hobbes’ account of sovereignty to develop an argument for a democratic social contract. Both these historical developments suggest that the liberal account of freedom may be less inimical to democracy and republicanism than modern republican thinkers such as Pettit, have claimed. Indeed, we suggest the second may offer the basis of the most compelling defence of democracy understood in republican terms.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Political Theory', 'Political History', 'Political Science', 'Cultural History', 'Constitutional Law']"

Historically, women in China were considered inferior to men and were not allowed to participate in any public or political activities until the May Fourth Movement. Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), China has made substantial efforts to promote gender equality in many aspects of life, including increasing the number of women leaders in government offices. However, the interwoven influences of social, cultural, and political factors present a complicated context to ensure fair opportunities for women leaders to succeed in political careers. To further pursue gender equality in government sectors, China needs to overcome several challenges to improve women’s descriptive and substantive representations in government positions: equip women with advanced leadership knowledge and skills; raise awareness of gender equality; build and support women’s self-confidence; and facilitate women-friendly organizational changes.","['Business and Management', 'Asian Business', 'Human Resource Development', 'Business Strategy/Leadership', ""Women's Studies""]"

In addition, wave generation, transformation and breaking play key roles in many physical processes, as they are essential for the analysis and characterisation of the behaviours of artificial and natural marine infrastructures near coasts. Breaking waves are complex phenomena that are enhanced by the vorticity and generation of turbulence and their evolution, during breaking and near the seabed. The transformation of a wave train that is breaking on a slope depends on the transport of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), which causes the advection and spread of turbulence and generates a vortex according to the type of breaking. These processes are complex and not fully elucidated. The laboratory provides powerful tools for investigating these processes more deeply by analysing the transfer between the atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers and the turbulent characteristics of the breaking waves. This chapter presents recent advances in laboratory testing that are based primarily on physical tests that were developed in a combined wave-wind flume.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-17215-1_3,en,Organic Agriculture and Greenhouse Gas Emissions,OriginalPaper,"Agricultural practices including those of organic agriculture (OA) affect the fluxes of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) between the land surface and the atmosphere. Increasing atmospheric concentrations of GHGs result in increases of Earth’s temperate through radiative forcing (RF). The CO 2 emissions in OA occur primarily from fossil fuel combustion (i.e., farm machinery use), and by soil and land-use management practices. While fossil fuel-derived CO 2 emissions may be smaller for OA, soil CO 2 emissions may be higher compared to those under nonorganic management based on a limited number of studies. Similarly, differences in soil CH 4 emissions between both systems may be small. Specifically, while upland soils under OA can be stronger sinks for CH 4 (0.09 kg CH 4 -C ha −1 year −1 higher soil uptake in temperate regions compared to nonorganic management), paddy soils under OA may be stronger CH 4 sources compared to nonorganically managed soils but data are scanty. Differences in livestock CH 4 emissions between conventional and OA systems appear to be small. However, soil N 2 O emissions under OA management may be smaller than those under conventional management due to lower inputs of reactive nitrogen (Nr) into OA soils. Otherwise, the more widespread use of leguminous cover crops, manure and slurry, poultry litter, and higher soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in topsoil can also contribute to increased N 2 O emissions at OA farms. Overall, soils under OA may emit 1.05 kg N 2 O-N ha −1 year −1 less than those under nonorganic management with the difference being 0.3 kg N 2 O-N ha −1 year −1 for studies in temperate regions. In conclusion, while there is some evidence that OA contributes less to the increases in atmospheric levels of GHGs, the database on farm emissions of CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O must be improved for more credible comparisons between conventional and OA systems. Therefore, the objectives of this chapter are to describe in detail what processes, and what livestock, soil and land-use management practices contribute to GHG emissions from OA systems, and how those emissions may be reduced.","['Life Sciences', 'Agriculture', 'Climate Change', 'Climate Change/Climate Change Impacts', 'Climate Change Management and Policy']"

Such autonomy allowed them to control the public message about the intervention. American FPE made high-profile public speeches to obtain support from the public and the legislature, whereas the latter stopped talking about the intervention to avoid a meaningful debate. Even if these executives adopted different communication strategies, both managed comparable fiscal resources to undertake their COIN strategy.

SDN architecture separates control and forwarding of network, provides the advantages of network programmable and easy expansion, and is of great significance in the application of the Internet of Things. Due to the dynamics of network load and device location, SDN control plane faces the problem of unbalanced load and energy. The load of some controllers is significantly higher than other nodes, resulting in a decrease in network performance; in a scenario where the energy of the control node is limited, some key nodes may run out of energy faster and shorten the life of the network. The dynamic placement of the controller is an effective way to solve this problem. This study uses the Oder-3 Markov predictor to predict the future access point location of the device, then used the branch and bound method to dynamically place the controller. The simulation results show that this method can effectively reduce the peak traffic of the SDN control plane and balance the historical load value of nodes.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics']"

Contemporary interpretations of financial capital include the extent to which both power and vulnerability can be managed by states (as for instance in recent asset-bubbling due mainly to the West’s 2009–2014 and 2020–2022 ‘Quantitative Easing,’ or the burst associated with 2022 economic sanctions against Russia, as cybercurrency autonomy loomed as a threat to central banks).

While Hilferding contributed to understanding how generalities of the capitalist debt system—especially corporate financing—could be advanced beyond the disorganized state of Marx’s Kapital Volume 3 , a critique is essential for both intellectual and practical purposes.","['Economics', 'Social Choice/Welfare Economics/Public Choice/Political Economy', 'Political Economy/Economic Systems', 'History of Economic Thought/Methodology', 'European Politics']"

Traditionally, the professional structure of higher education has provided restricted employment, career, and leadership opportunities for women, which is exacerbated where there is an intersection with race, culture, religion, or age. Women continue to be underrepresented in academia across various disciplines and this lack of representation in senior positions within the professional structure of higher education itself acts as a barrier to more women reaching senior levels within institutions. More women are needed in higher positions to increase representation and visibility, to be truly inclusive of all, and to encourage and mentor others to then aspire to follow a similar path. This critical review examines gender equity across the major career benchmarks of the academy in light of the impact of the personal contexts of women, systemic processes that hinder career progression, inclusion and cultural barriers that impede promotion and career progression. Research-based systemic, inclusive solutions are discussed that work towards improved gender equity for all women.

The PUFA content of the cell membrane is mostly determined by dietary intake. They are a component of the cellular membrane, improving its fluidity and PUFAs must be released from the membrane by phospholipases in order for signal transmission to occur. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids exert their anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting lipogenesis and increasing the production of resolvins and protectins. n-3 PUFAs mediate some of these effects by antagonizing n-6 PUFA-induced proinflammatory prostaglandin E formation. Today’s industrialized societies with Westernized diet styles have higher overall energy intake, and n-6 PUFAs, but lower energy expenditure. Omega-3 PUFA attenuates ER stress and increases mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation and mitochondrial uncoupling. There is competition between omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 for desaturation enzymes. The unbalanced omega 6/omega 3 ratio in favor of omega 6 PUFAs contributes to the prevalence of atherosclerosis, obesity, and diabetes. n-3 PUFAs are considered to be more protective against inflammation compared with omega 6 PUFA, suggesting the importance of maintaining an ideal balance.","['Biomedicine', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Pharmacology/Toxicology']"

Women’s Parliamentary Representation and Quota Implementation in Croatia Since 2011,OriginalPaper,"Quota implementation in Croatia has been riddled with ambivalence, contradiction, and obstruction since the enactment of the 2008 Act on Gender Equality. It was only at the 2020 elections that 22.5% of women were elected to parliament. Prior to that, paradoxically, Croatia had achieved the highest levels of women’s parliamentary representation before the introduction of legislative quotas. This chapter analyzes the implementation of gender quotas and explains why the proclaimed goal of 40% gender-balanced representation is not yet achieved. Emphasis is put on the implementation of quotas by the major parties in parliament during the 2011, 2015, 2016, and 2020 elections. The analysis suggests that, with the exception of early elections, the smaller parties have adjusted to quota requirements gradually, but, and this is important, there has been no meaningful recalibration of practices by the major parties. Simultaneously, women were placed at the bottom of the candidate lists and parties that did not comply with the quota rules were not sanctioned by any significant means. Indictments are not issued, or are issued years after the infractions occurred, courts are not giving their rulings in a timely manner, and the penalties awarded are inadequate. The Croatian case serves as an apt example (and a cautionary tale) of quota failure due to poor policy design, limited implementation, and an overall lack of commitment by major policy actors.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Politics and Gender', 'Gender Studies', 'Comparative Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Public Administration']"

This is one of the reasons why conventional architectural approaches and technologies are now constantly subjected to series of modifications the most crucial of which is caused by the necessity for decentralized operation. There exists a good portion of algorithms which enable handle this problem. However, only a few of those optimize against multiple objectives, much less enable subjecting a network to coordination. In this paper, we propose an approach that enables setting of multiple objectives for load balancing process in a way so it only requires a coordinating entity to operate with strategic-level terms. Decisions made on this level fuse into local-level decision making performed by individual agents (network nodes), thus enabling separation of responsibilities in terms of scope thus allowing to fit the process of load balancing taking states of the network’s particular parts into consideration.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The gabs between glass panels are filled with Argon gas. Calculations are performed for different outdoor temperatures which correspond to daily temperature in London, United Kingdom on April. The results of the temperature distribution profile in the cavities of multi-panel glass windows show that this type of window greatly affects the reduction of heat loss, as these glass panels act as radiation shields that suppress heat currents by slowing the flow in the cavity. It can be concluded that the amount of heat loss through windows is based greatly on the width of cavity between the glass layer, the thermal characteristics of the cavity filler and the temperature difference between the interior and the outside. As for the thickness of the glass panels, it was found to have an unnoticeable effect on the amount of heat transferred inside the multiple glass window system. In addition, the number of glass panes thought to have inconsiderable effect on the amount of the transferred heat within the multiple glass window systems.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Arts', 'Building Construction and Design']"

This chapter shows the application of measurement in a social science context where the motivation is transparency and equity rather than the advancement of scientific laws. However, to achieve these, the realization of measurement needs to be no less rigorous than it is in the advancement of scientific laws. Rasch measurement theory provides the basis for such rigor. The context in this chapter is competitive selection into universities in Western Australia based on a summary performance on a series of instruments which assess achievement in a range of discipline areas. Such selection tends to determine life opportunities; therefore to ensure consistency and fairness, performances on different instruments need to be transformed into measurements which are in the same, explicit unit relative to a specified origin. Because the illustrative context is complex, it is considered that the Rasch measurement theory applied in this chapter could be applied to a range of social contexts where assessments on different instruments need to be transformed to measurements in a common unit referenced to a common origin and where the focus is on making decisions at the person level.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Health Informatics', 'Psychometrics', 'Health Administration']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-19467-2_1,en,A Comprehensive Overview of SDG 14: Life Below Water_Final,OriginalPaper,"An important part of the health of the oceans depends on a good balance of the biogeochemical cycles. Both climate change (in its broadest sense, from the warming of the oceans to acidification) and the introduction of excess nutrients or heavy metals have caused, in many places, distortions in the balances between chemical elements, organisms and detritus. A series of scenarios have been created in which the excess or absence of certain components are distorting carbon fluxes or biomass accumulation. Such changes are not new at all, but now are accelerating and we have to be ready to understand and manage the repercussions that they may have locally and globally. An increase in nitrogen and phosphorus due to land changes in the Amazon, together with other local phenomena, are promoting an uncontrolled increase in Sargassum , which moves every year with the currents until it invades the Caribbean coast, for example. There is such inertia in the entry of these nutrients into the ocean that it becomes difficult to manage them, and even in areas where there is already a much more exhaustive control of the agricultural or industrial activities that promote them, the proliferation of micro and macro algae seems unstoppable. The microbial composition and also the seasonality are key points that have to be considered, especially when certain physical phenomena are weakened such as upwelling (and the related nutrient supply) or the ocean currents (and the related nutrient transport). Several models are based not only on temperature changes (which affect the availability of macro and micronutrients) but also on coastal morphology and local current dynamics. Such models are complex but very useful to understand, locally, what may happen with a cascade effect, such as the relationship of biogeochemical cycles with primary productivity and, in turn, with biomass production. Climate change is greatly affecting this nutrient availability, not only because the physical-chemical balance may be changing, but also because the organisms that process these nutrients are also changing and their ability to recycle may be affected. Acidification also enters this equation, which makes some microelements less available, or makes some species (for example, coccolithophorids) less capable of completing their life cycles, compete for nutrients or suffer more predation because they have more fragile structures. Latitude must also be taken into account in these changes, both due to the effects of climate change and the direct impacts of human activities that have profoundly transformed many ocean environments. In certain areas the predominance of the impact on biogeochemical cycle comes from the direct action of humans (e.g. fertilizers, farming, etc.), but in others the predominance comes from the warming or acidifying effect due to climate change. Thus, for example, the most accelerated changes in the Arctic are having very rapid effects on these biogeochemical cycles, both due to the increase in temperature and acidification and also due to the fact that the dynamics and coverage of the ice are changing. In this area, the direct impacts by pollution and eutrophication are replaced by climate change accelerating paths. Associated with these changes in nutrient cycles is the decrease in available oxygen that alters the physiological capacities of some organisms. The increase in temperature, the decrease in primary production and the slowdown in currents in various parts of the planet are affecting the response capacity of organisms, from benthic to pelagic. No less important is also the fact that stormy phenomena of different types are increasing in frequency and intensity. Storms and hurricanes are also responsible for the distortion of biogeochemical cycles, in some cases impoverishing biomass production and its quality for the following trophic levels. It is a very complex scenario in which the physiology and adaptability of many organisms is at stake, and which we will have to understand in order to properly manage marine resources in the near future.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"

Spectral and temporal boundary value problems of beam vibrations do not always have closed-form analytical solutions. As a result, many approximate methods are used to obtain the solution by discretizing the spatial problem. Spectral Chebyshev technique (SCT) utilizes the Chebyshev polynomials for spatial discretization and applies Galerkin’s method to obtain boundary conditions and spatially discretized equations of motions. Boundary conditions are imposed using basis recombination into the problem, and as a result of this, the solution can be obtained to any linear boundary condition without the need for re-derivation. System matrices are generated with the SCT, and natural frequencies and mode shapes are obtained by eigenvalue problem solution. Harmonic balance method (HBM) is used to solve nonlinear equation of motion in frequency domain, with large deformation nonlinearity. As a result, a generic method is constructed to solve nonlinear vibrations of uniform and functionally graded beams in frequency domain, subjected to different boundary conditions.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Automotive Engineering']"

The need to model robot control systems in their design is justified. An approach to describing the operation of a robot control system based on a classical differential equation system capable of generating requirements for a robot control system is presented. It is shown that this approach allows to describe the process of operation of the robot control system only in stationary mode, without taking into account workload intensity and time delays in different modes of operation of the robot control system. In order to compensate for the detected shortcomings, it is proposed to describe the operation of the robot control system in the form of a non-Markov process based on the principle of balance of “complex probabilities.“ This replaces the time characteristics with their images in the Laplace transform. Solving the system of state balance equations enables to obtain probabilistic characteristics of transient processes of robot control system operation in time domain.

Vienna rectifier consists of three switches and four diodes with an input inductor and performs both AC/DC and DC/DC conversions in a single stage. A permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) coupled with wind turbine system is used in this paper. The tracking of the maximum power is a real challenge in wind energy systems. In this paper, the variable speed of the wind turbine generator system and the power output of the permanent magnet synchronous generator are chosen as inputs to the fuzzy logic controller to track the maximum power according to the change in wind speed by following 27 set of rules formulated in the fuzzy rule base. The pulse width modulated signals from the fuzzy logic controller initiate the three switches in the Vienna rectifier. The proposed control scheme not only tracks the maximum power from the wind but also enhances the input DC voltage, ensures sinusoidal nature at input mains and balances the voltage across the two capacitors. The Vienna rectifier is interfaced to the grid through space vector pulse width modulated voltage source inverter. The MATLAB/Simulink environment is utilized in order to observe the optimum performance of the system. The proposed control algorithm is experimentally validated using a real-time simulator OPAL RT 4200. The experimental results are in agreement with simulation results and prove the robustness of the control scheme.","['Energy', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Environmental Policy', 'Sociology, general']"

Our economies and cities are no less structured as a network than our personal relations and critical infrastructures . How different nodes are connected in such systems has crucial implications for their functioning, stability, resilience, and most importantly – the risks generated within. This chapter starts by looking at different networks and their potential to dampen or (most often) amplify risk. It also reviews different types of network formation mechanisms and their resulting topologies in the hope that these will inform a more sophisticated view of real-life risk exposures. Formal metrics of the network structure are introduced with clear recourse to what they mean for the risk manager.

The large differences of speed at different lanes prevent lane changes of queued vehicles and further increase road congestion. This paper develops a centralized non-recurrent queue management (CNRQM) system to resolve non-recurrent queues as well as to minimize their congestion impacts. The system applies a game theoretic lane changing model to coordinate connected vehicles in queues and open lanes and provides speed and lane changing instructions for all connected vehicles in the control region to minimize the travel time delay of all vehicles. In addition, a centralized control is deployed to manage traffic at high market penetration rates (MPRs) of connected vehicles to overcome the drawback of the distribution control. The system is evaluated with microscopic traffic simulations under different MPRs of connected vehicles and demand levels. The results indicates that the centralized control can gain significant mobility improvements for both connected and non-connected vehicles even at very high MPRs. Moreover, the mobility benefits to each individual vehicles are evaluated to analyze the society impact of the proposed system to different types of road users.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Although the wheeled IV drip stand is more convenient for patient movement, it is not easy to go up and down stairs or through steep ground because of the weight and the length of the IV stand. In this study, the design of carryable IV frame aims to provide patients with safety, convenience in wearing, getting out of the bed, going to eat, and going up and down stairs. Due to bending or movement, the proposed control mechanism of angle compensation can ensure that the potential energy is sufficient to overcome the intravenous pressure for avoiding blood reflux. To dynamically adjust the system parameters, this work develops an adaptive fuzzy-PID controller and a fuzzy-PID neural network controller. Comparing to existing studies, the experimental results show that the fuzzy-PID neural network controller has the best performance characteristics, which improves the accuracy and performance of the system control.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Sociology, general', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Machine Learning']"

In recent years, there has been a marked upsurge in student mobilization against inequality and social injustice within universities and in wider society. By drawing on ethnographic fieldwork material generated with left-wing student activists in New Zealand in 2012 and 2015, the article investigates how two different student activist networks, in their struggles for equality and justice, navigate ethical dilemmas around inclusion and exclusion and balance universal moral claims against a sensitivity to situated ethical complexities and locally embedded experiences and values. While sharing the goal of fighting inequality, the two networks differ in their emphasis on the creation of ‘dissensus’ and ‘safe spaces’ in their network, their university and in wider society. The article draws upon two interconnected strands of theories, namely, debates about deliberative democracy, including questions of universal accessibility and inclusion/exclusion, and theories around ethics as a question of living up to universal moral imperatives (deontology) or as embedded in everyday negotiations and cultivations of virtues (virtue ethics). Inspired by Mansbridge, it proposes that central to radical student activism as an ethical practice is the ability to act as a (subaltern) counter public that not only ‘nags’ or haunts dominant moralities from the margins but also allows for the cultivation of spaces and identities within the activist networks that can ‘nag’ or haunt the networks’ own moral frames and virtues and goad them into action and new democratic experiments.","['Social Sciences', 'Political Sociology', 'Moral Philosophy', 'Ethics', 'Political Theory']"

This chapter exploits cognitive technologies, based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), for automatically learning how to control the HVAC system in an office. The goal is to develop a cyber-controller able to minimize both the perceived thermal discomfort and the needed energy. The learning process is driven through the definition of a cumulative reward, which includes and combines two reward components that consider, respectively, user comfort and energy consumption. Moreover, a human reward, inferred by the frequency of user interactions with the HVAC system, helps the DRL controller learn the requirements of users and readily adapt to them. Simulation experiments are performed to assess the impact that the two components of the reward have on the behavior of the DRL controller and on the learning process.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Computer Applications']"

There are 5 types of commonly occurring cancers which include Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), Tubular carcinoma, Medullary carcinoma, and Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). Early detection of breast cancer creates 93% or more chances of survival. So in order to detect breast cancer, one of the important morphological feature is mitotic count—showing the rate of division of cell. In a dataset, if one class have less number of examples compared to number of examples in the other class, then the dataset is imbalanced. Since there is much abundance of non-mitotic cells over mitotic cells, the dataset has class imbalance problem. This class skewness leads to inefficiency in classification task. At present there are many models which uses data sampling methods in order to decrease the class imbalance problem. But if there is a feature set that provides the exact decision boundary, then there is no need of sampling methods for solving the class imbalance issue. Therefore in this work a model is proposed which uses autoencoders to learn a feature set which has better classification capabilities of majority class and minority class to address the class imbalance problem. In this paper, Dual stacked autoencoder is applied on imbalanced mitotic and non-mitotic dataset, which showed improvement in f-measure and also reduces the overhead of smapling the dataset. The proposed dual stack autoencoder shown f-measure of 0.82, and outperformed many of the traditional classification methods.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

The functional and structural divisions between the three branches of government in every democratic state are embedded in the concept of separation of powers. South Africa having negotiated a new constitution that gave birth to a constitutional democracy in postapartheid, the idea of separation and balancing of power was ingrained into the laws enacted by the state. Despite the misgivings surrounding the practical application of the concept, the country has made some strides in defending the letter and spirit of the 1996 Constitution by upholding the doctrine of separation of power and rule of law through a functioning government, independent judiciary, and effective parliament. Thus, this chapter unpacked the commitment of South Africa toward the tenets of separation of power. The study highlighted that the institutional and procedural structures have inspired cooperative government and checks and balances among the branches of government. Moreover, the structural and procedural partitions of public powers coupled with oversight responsibilities and veto powers have increased the assurance of the public in the three branches of government. The study emphasized that the emerging democracy in South Africa could be further consolidated if the branches of government remain committed to the tenets of separation of power.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'African Politics', 'Comparative Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Public Policy', 'Electoral Politics', 'Public Administration']"

One people with PD has been enrolled and gait analysis was performed before and after a 4-weeks gait training intervention with an overground exoskeleton. Inverse kinematics, inverse dynamics, and static optimization were performed in OpenSim. Results from joint moments and muscle forces were compared with a group of healthy controls. Preliminary results showed that after the therapy joint loads in both ankle and knee joints were reduced during the stance phase and muscle forces displayed an increased magnitude in their peak after the treatment.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-09719-5_11,en,Central Nervous System Near-Infrared Spectroscopic Monitoring: Technique and Clinical Application,OriginalPaper,"Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) non-invasively measures regional oxygen saturation (rScO 2 ) in the tissue beds of the cerebral cortex. NIRS provides an assessment of the adequacy of oxygen supply relative to demand in vascular beds, and is the technology used in cerebral oximetry. NIRS has been widely adopted as a monitor of the adequacy of brain tissue oxygenation in anesthesiology and critical care medicine and is also used intraoperatively to monitor the perfusion of the spinal cord and some other somatic vascular beds. Measurements of rScO 2 are affected by patient factors, disease states, physiologic alterations, and the variable technology and algorithms incorporated in the design of commercial monitors. It is essential that clinicians understand the technology that underlies NIRS-based cerebral oximetry so that monitoring data can be interpreted correctly. Cerebral oximetry is influenced by a variety of physiologic inputs that can alert clinicians to dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) and other vital organs. Specifically, cerebral NIRS monitoring integrates the cumulative input of (a) cardiac output, (b) arterial blood pressure, (c) arterial oxygen content, (d) pH and partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ), (e) patency of the CNS vasculature, (f) cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO 2 ), (g) intracranial pressure (ICP), and (h) cerebral autoregulation. Cerebral oximetry is widely used in neonatology, vascular surgery, cardiac surgery, neurologic critical care, and pediatric and adult anesthesia practice. In this chapter, we review (a) the current state of NIRS monitoring technology and its limitations, (b) the physiologic variables that alter tissue oxygen balance, (c) the rationale for the use of cerebral oximetry in critical care medicine and anesthesia practice, (d) the evidence that supports its use in specific patient populations and surgical procedures, and (e) future directions for the development of NIRS technology and clinical applications .","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Anesthesiology', 'Neurosurgery', 'Pain Medicine']"

The TCS is a common-property resource that was constructed about 2000 years ago and has been managed since then for generations using public-participatory approaches. Furthermore, the application of TCS is not only limited to irrigation but also domestic water supply, livestock management, retarding negative impacts from extreme events such as seasonal flooding and recurrent droughts. In addition, the indirect benefits of TCS in providing environmental services, being essentially controlling the micro-climatic conditions, are numerous. However, TCS has been degrading since the colonial rule due to limited TCS management. The policy on the rights to manage minor irrigation works (tank irrigation) lies in the hands of the estate continued even during the post-independence period. As a consequence, the rural economy and livelihood security, which was essentially dependent on TCS , collapsed. Nevertheless, since the 1980s, the Indian Government started realizing the significance of traditional TCS in the view of climate change, rapid urbanization, and demographic explosion. Several schemes and programs were launched in bilateral associations with local and foreign agencies including the World Bank. The evidence indicated that the policy interventions in regards to scientific revival and ecological restoration, and rehabilitation of tanks for providing substantial benefits to the stakeholders (farmers and local communities) are rational. Interventions for tank management are much-needed with a case-to-case approach rather than implementing the ideology of one model fits all.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes']"

Being an essential cell quality control system, the process of autophagy regulates various properties of all types of stem cells Stem cells such as their self-renewal, homeostasis, stemness and most importantly, their lineage commitment. Undifferentiated stem cells accumulate autophagosomes due to arrested autophagy which is resumed only during differentiation into specific lineages. In terms of differentiation, autophagy is crucially involved in maintaining the balance between osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis in Wnt/β-catenin mediated manner. Enhanced autophagy is seen in the case of osteogenic differentiation of stem and progenitor cells, and defects in the autophagic process have been implicated in the development of various bone disorders such as osteoporosis, osteopetrosis, Paget’s disease and arthritis. This book chapter describes the role of autophagy in the regulation of stem cells characteristics, including the regulation of embryonic stem cells during embryogenesis and in skeletal tissue formation with special emphasis on the recent evidence supporting the autophagic regulation of osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and the consequent implications in bone pathology.","['Biomedicine', 'Cancer Research', 'Cell Biology', 'Developmental Biology']"

For the first time, the refrigeration load needed to provide the coolant for the condensers of the Rankine cycles has been considered for analysis. Also, for the first time, a part load performance study has been carried out. It has been found that the refrigeration load of the condensers’ coolant has a significant influence on the net power produced as the coolant is required at very low temperatures. The coolant refrigeration load caused a drop of 6.2% points of energy efficiency and 11.9% points of exergy efficiency. At part load (80%), the energy and exergy efficiencies have dropped by 3% points and 2% points, respectively. From the present study, it could be concluded that it is prudent to consider the coolant load for a realistic performance analysis based both on energy and exergy. From the study, it turns out that the organic Rankine cycles are parasitical in nature and actually consume the power produced by the main geothermal plant turbine.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Materials Engineering']"

Healthy aging defines the process of developing and maintaining the functional ability that allows well-being in older age. It is based on three cardinal factors for the person: functional ability (i.e., “health-related attributes that enable people to be and to do what they have reason to value”), intrinsic capacity (i.e., the composite of all the physical and mental capacities of an individual), and environment. The maintenance of functional ability represents the common goal of the public health framework. At the same time, the intrinsic capacity model entails an essential shift from a negative to a positive perception of health, quitting obsolete traditional paradigms (i.e., diseases, impairments, disabilities) to the assessment of the individual’s positive attributes (i.e., functions, reserves). In this chapter, a novel approach that the World Health Organization has recently described for promoting healthy aging in our societies is presented. The framework promotes a substantial modification of the health and social care systems that should be redesigned having the individual at the center of a multidisciplinary and multidimensional action.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'General Practice / Family Medicine', 'Geriatrics/Gerontology', 'Public Health', 'Nursing', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Orthopedics']"

In this paper, a hydraulic model in the curvilinear coordinates is applied to simulate eight tidal constituents (M 2 , S2, O 1 , K 1 , N 2 , K 2 , P 1 and Q 1 from Vung Tau to Bac Lieu, Vietnam. The hydraulic model with the two-dimensional orthogonal curvilinear grid has the advantage of increasing the accuracy in the results at the domain boundary. The numerical method of this model derives from the solution of the Reynolds system of equations averaged over the depth in the curvilinear coordinate systems. The model verification is implemented based on the equilibrium of the tidal currents of energy. The results of this model are used to mapping tidal constituents from Vung Tau to Bac Lieu, Vietnam. From Vung Tau to Bac Lieu, the amplitude and phase values of the tidal constituents K 1 are higher than those from Vung Tau to Tra Vinh and approximately as high as those in Bac Lieu with the amplitude of 0.5 m and a phase range from 345 0 to 350 0 .

The oxide layer that formed on the carbon steel surface behaves as a deposit non-protective layer when the surface is exposed to high temperature. Thus, the surface of the carbon steel must be coated with a metal that can be formed oxide surface and intermetallic layer that can protect the carbon steel from high-temperature corrosion. The objective of this study is to determine the corrosion characteristics, microstructures and surface morphologies of hot-dipped aluminizing coating material at 750 °C under atmospheric air, dry oxygen (Ar–20%O 2 ) and wet oxygen (Ar–20%O 2 –20%H 2 O) flows. The optimum thickness coating was acquired by carrying out the hot dipping coating technique using pure Al at different molten temperatures and dipping time. The coating specimens were exposed to atmospheric air, dry and wet oxygen environments all at temperature of 750 °C. The pre- and post-exposing hot-dipped aluminizing coatings were analysed using optical microscope, SEM and EDAX to study its surface morphologies, coating cross sections and elemental compositions, whereas phase compositions was determined using XRD. The strengths of the coatings were measured according to microhardness index values. The hot dipping technique caused two layers to be formed on the carbon steel surface, the outer Al layer and the inner aluminide layer (Fe–Al). Results from the high-temperature experiments indicates that the optimum lanthanum content in Al is 0.3%wt that gives the lowest corrosion rate with a kinetic constant of 3.45 × 10 −11 g 2 cm −4  s −1 . This is because the lanthnum content in the aluminizing improve the plasticity of aluminized layer and the adhesion ability of Al 2 O 3 film, caused promoting a form of protective oxide film and lead to reduce the size and numbers of void formation at the aluminide layer. The presence of water vapour in the oxidant gas atmospheres lead to the rapid degradation of aluminide layer caused by formation of voids and cracks that led to oxidation occurs at the aluminide layer compared with dry oxygen. In conclusion, in addition of lanthanum in aluminizing up to 0.3%wt can retard the corrosion rate of carbon steel at high temperature in flowing of atmospheric air, dry and wet oxygen gases.","['Engineering', 'Materials Engineering', 'Inorganic Chemistry', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films', 'Energy Materials', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings']"

We review current evidence from basic sciences and epidemiology linking stress to the development and progression of metabolic disorders throughout life. Findings from rodents demonstrate that stress can affect features of metabolic dysfunction, such as insulin resistance, glucose and lipid homeostasis, as well as ageing processes such as cellular senescence and telomere length shortening. In human studies, stressors in the home, workplace and neighbourhood are associated with accelerated ageing and metabolic and immune alterations, both directly and indirectly via behavioural risks. The likelihood of developing clinical conditions, such as diabetes mellitus and hepatic steatosis is increased in individuals with adverse childhood experiences or long-term (years) or severe stress at work or in private life. The increased risk of metabolic disorders is often associated with other stress-related conditions, such as mental health disorders, cardiovascular disease and increased susceptibility to infections. Equally, stress can worsen prognosis in metabolic diseases. As favourable modifications in stressors are associated with reductions in incidence of metabolic disorders, further investigation of the therapeutic value of targeting stress in personalized medicine is warranted. Life stress is known to affect the development and progression of metabolic diseases. This Review discusses the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the association between stress and metabolic disease, and evaluates the epidemiological evidence for the influence of stress on metabolic disease. Both animal and human research suggests that stress and related changes in sympathetic–parasympathetic balance and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis can accelerate biological ageing, including unfavourable changes in metabolism and immune function. The adverse impact on metabolic disease risk in adults with a history of childhood adversity is potentiated by mental disorders and behavioural risks and the risk of metabolic disease can be more than twofold higher than in adults without childhood adversity. In adults, stress is associated with a 1.1-fold to 1.4-fold excess risk of obesity, diabetes mellitus and liver disease. The excess risk for mental disorders, such as depression, and cardiovascular disease among individuals with stress in adulthood is slightly higher than that for obesity, diabetes mellitus and liver disease. Life stress is also a prognostic factor in patients, accelerating the transition of metabolic diseases towards multimorbidity, frailty and death.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Endocrinology']"

Although she was born and educated in the United States, Dzegede considers herself nomadic, undertaking residencies over the last six years across the United States, Europe, and West Africa. I seek to interrogate the political potential of nomadism as expressed in Dzegede’s fabric-based work, particularly her charged use of color, pattern, cultural, and personal signifiers.

This sector is significant because it can help generate economic growth and provide housewives with employment opportunities. The informal economic sector includes unregistered and unregulated, but not illegal, business activity. The informal economic sector's concept and characteristics, such as accessibility, low capital utilization, and small operating levels, have made it thrive among Malaysia's housewives. The increase in the number of housewives in entrepreneurship shows that they are mature in running a business. Thus, it can be seen from the perception of housewives the factors of the challenges faced by housewives in running their business, the opportunities in their business operations, and the prospects for such success, focusing on four aspects: human capital, social capital, financial capital, and psychological capital.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

As the geriatric population progresses, the need for novel solutions to manage age-related diseases increases. To combat this, intensive rehabilitation treatment is instituted repetitively. However, the traditional rehabilitation treatment regimes, involving tedious and monotonous activity with numerous repetitions, lacking active patient participation are of boring and strenuous nature. This ultimately leads to suboptimal treatment outcomes necessitating long-term care. To overcome this, a range of interactive and easy measuring technology-based innovative solutions fused with the rehabilitation process is being investigated to ameliorate the effectiveness and productivity of rehabilitation programs and escalate the independence of patients and empower them to administer their treatment. Recently, game-based Virtual Reality (VR) rehabilitation protocol has turned out to be a promising therapeutic alternative, amalgamating Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) with VR to activate neuro-motor functions, sustain motivation and reach rehabilitation goals to improve the quality of life of patients. Virtual rehabilitation is a computer-generated interactive patient-centred simulation system combining computers, special interfaces, and simulation exercises that imitates reality and provides an artificial environment mimicking real-world experience. The architecture of the system is designed in such a way that it can remotely track the patients, obtain data, and tailor the rehabilitation sessions according to the current needs of the patients. VR improves both motor skills and confidence for daily living and in numerous situations to enhance functional results, improving the clinical and social benefits of surgery. Thus, game-based VR is being developed to allow clinicians to create game-based VR tasks and this will serve to drive advances in rehabilitation interventions.","['Computer Science', 'Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It consists of small metal components located under the platforms of the blades, which dissipate the vibratory energy through friction when a relative displacement between the blades and the damper appears. It is well known that the shape of such component has a strong influence on the damping properties and should be designed with a particular attention. With the arrival of additive manufacturing, new dedicated shapes for these dampers can be considered, determined with specific numerical methods as topological optimisation (TO). However, the presence of the contact nonlinearity challenges the use of traditional TO methods to minimise the vibration levels at resonance. In this work, the topology of the damper is parametrised with the moving morphable components (MMC) framework and optimised based on meta-modelling techniques: here kriging coupled with the efficient global optimisation (EGO) algorithm. The level of vibration at resonance is computed based on the harmonic balance method augmented with a constraint to aim directly for the resonant solution. It corresponds to the objective function to be minimised. Additionally, a mechanical constraint based on static stress analysis is also considered to propose reliable damper designs. Results demonstrate the efficiency of the method and show that damper geometries that meet the engineers’ requirements can be identified.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Automotive Engineering']"

Money Transfer Wristband offers a platform where the chances of such attacks are minimized and money can be transferred easily from one user to another at any time. This system contains a Fingerprint Sensor, LCD display and a Serial Communication port for transferring data between any trusted applications to the microcontroller. After linking microcontroller with the application, wallet balance is displayed along with details which are entered by the user on LCD for simple communication and after that registration of authenticated finger is done. After entering amount and user ID, it again asks the user to place the finger for initiating transaction and if the finger matches with the finger previously stored, transaction is successful otherwise transaction fails.

Drawing on Critical Security Studies, it argues that the latter is securitised at EU level by contagion , that is, by being problematised as an epiphenomenon of transnational organised crime and irregular immigration. As such, it is inserted within the European security continuum that links the two as threats the internal security of the EU and subjected to its specific modality of governing (in)security, premised on governing freedom by managing its dangerous excess using both sovereign and biopolitical techniques. That trafficking in women for sexual exploitation is conceived as a form of both transnational organised crime and irregular immigration, however, makes it a form of forced irregular immigration, and thus trafficked women victims . Hence while the issue itself is addressed as a threat to the internal security of the EU, trafficked women are not; they are addressed as victims and, as such, as an exception to the repressive and punitive regimes the EU deploys against organised criminals and irregular immigrants.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Politics and Gender', 'European Politics', 'International Security Studies']"

In this paper, the cooling and heating loads of the office building were calculated in detail and the equipment’s parameters were strictly selected. The TRNSYS software was used to conduct numerical simulation research and feasibility analysis for the SAGSHP system. The advantages of the SAGSHP system over a single energy supply system and soil thermal balance after long-term operation are explored. The results show that the collector efficiency of the SAGSHP system is increased by 13.36% compared with the single solar heat collection system, and the soil thermal imbalance can be greatly reduced compared with the single GSHP system. The average soil temperature in the SAGSHP system and the GSHP system decreased by 0.04 °C and 0.31 °C after one year and 0.06 °C and 1.97 °C after ten years, respectively. The SAGSHP system also has a more stable unit performance coefficient than the GSHP system. The SAGSHP system can improve the efficiency of solar energy, make the system power supply stable and maintain the soil thermal balance, which is worth promoting in engineering applications.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Environment, general', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Water, general']"

The specific urban structure can affect microclimate because of the high radiation generated. On the other side, urban structure blocks the distribution of incoming wind. Urban structure changes how the microclimate influences the city. The successful urban structure can impact how outdoor open spaces are used meanwhile good open spaces are affected by how comfortable can be accepted. In addition, water and greenery space is an essential urban part and has a vital environmental implication in alleviating the urban heat island (UHI). This chapter analysed thermal comfort in cold coastal areas and tropical areas. Especially in the cold coastal areas, this chapter chooses 3 plots of land used for education, 2 used as parks, 6 for commercial use, 2 for industrial land, 11 for residential land, and 6 for other land-use types. Because the field measurement points are scattered throughout the city, and the numbers of measurement instruments and researchers are limited, the 30 points are divided into five groups. Through simultaneous tests at the same period and time interval, the degree of difference in the urban thermal environment under different land categories and building types is analyzed. Through research, we found that the coupling relationship between outdoor environmental performance (OEP) and BH is analyzed qualitatively at different ranges. The maximum R 2 is 0.9052, the minimum is 0.3813, and the average is 0.80, indicating an apparent quadratic polynomial relationship between AT and BH within 500 m. In addition, the coupling strength between BH and RH is relatively high. The coupling relationship between AT and BH appears to be the opposite of RH and BH. The data are also highly discrete, so there is no clear relationship between BH and WS. Coupling strength in the range of 100 m, 300 m, 700 m, and 900 m is not as strong as that of 500 m, showing higher data dispersion and a smaller R 2 value. So urban structures must be well designed to make wind release the heat trapped in the urban area. This chapter also takes urban green infrastructure of Tianjin in China as a case, using subjective and objective analysis and model simulation. Waterfront compound greenery’s cooling effect was found more significant at waterfront 3–6 m, where the location was suitable for construction. When the green lawn of the waterfront space was 12 m and the water shore’s geometric form was S-shaped, this could improve the cooling effect of water significantly. This chapter provides practical implications and useful guidance for the urban planning and design.","['Life Sciences', 'Urban Ecology', 'Sustainable Development', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Cities, Countries, Regions']"

Quantitative and price indices of trading conditions have been analyzed in order to diagnose the place and importance of Ukraine in foreign agricultural markets and to outline ways to optimize the structure of foreign trade operations. Indices of terms of trade «price» and «quantitative» characterize the extent to which a country wins (loses) by changing the price (quantity) of goods in foreign trade with a particular country (countries) for the relevant period of time.The indicator of the terms of trade measures the relative dynamics of export prices over a certain period and is calculated for the analysis of foreign trade activity, which is measured by the ratio of average export earnings of goods and average costs of imports over a certain period of time. The results showed that in 2018, the price index of terms of trade decreased by 2.2%, quantitative - increased by 2.9%, ie terms of trade slightly deteriorated.

However, ICT has become an important sector in Malaysia’s economic development, acknowledged by the Government of Malaysia as a strategy in creating an industrial-based economy and a knowledge-based economy. The supply pool of (Degree and Diploma) graduates in ICT-related disciplines such as Computer Science, Multimedia, Animation, Information Technology, and much more still outweigh the demand pool by ICT industries. However, there is a vast disparity between the annual growth rate of ICT demand and ICT talent supply. This disparity indicates that they could be a shift of balance between ICT talents supply and ICT industrial needs demands. Hence, it is necessary to understand Malaysia’s ICT sector’s dynamics and evolution and identify the factors and challenges affecting the balance of ICT demand and supply chain. This paper using secondary data, mainly from the MSC Talents report, Malaysia Digital Economy Blueprint, and Malaysia National Policy on Industry 4.0, provide an overall landscape of ICT Talents in Malaysia. We also propose a process-based framework to bridge the gap between ICT demand and supply by using Business Intelligence technologies. In conclusion, to ensure the balance of demand and supply digital talent in Malaysia, a proper mechanism such as a talent data lake will help give the right input to the stakeholders.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

Early in the sustainability movement, many rejected the idea of “environmental balance” as an impossible goal that ignored the realities of the Anthropocene. Thirty years hence two questions remain: Can technological means save us from ecological disaster, or will we fail without disruptive cultural, economic, and behavioral change? It is now clear that both are necessary. Over the last two decades, ecologically sensitive design approaches at the building scale have been understood better compared to those at the urban scale, and there have been significant developments in the field, although the contemporary architectural practice in the developing countries is still lacking many aspects of sustainable building design. The absence of the urban or neighborhood scale in most environmental literature was masked by the recent obsession with “green” buildings, most of which look green on their facades but lack energy saving ideas, climate-sensitive design, use of locally appropriate materials, and so forth. Based on these shortcomings, the authors critically explore in this chapter the concepts of green urbanism and green architecture based on the ideas observed in the development of the ancient settlements and the traditional contexts, introducing the Seventy-Six, the second author’s awarded project in Albany, New York.

If in-flight switching control can be feasible between a drag-minimizing load distribution during a cruise, which accounts for most of the flight time, and a dedicated gust-tolerant load distribution for turbulent airspace, then it will be possible to extend the aspect ratio of the main wing while mitigating actual structural damage without weight increase. The technology to design the optimum target load distribution by multi-objective optimization already exists, but the feasibility of feedback control to realize the target load distribution has not yet been investigated. In this study, this problem is solved by an adaption scheme consisting of in-flight pressure field sensing, real-time modeling of unsteady pressure fluctuations, and stochastic optimal control.

The results show that the interfacial tension was reduced by eutetic GaIn (E-GaIn) adsorbing R·COO − ions in the rosin-ethanol solution. When the metal droplet was applied to the positive electrode, a significant further reduction in the interfacial tension was achieved. Based on the top-view sessile drop method, the wetting behavior of rosin-ethanol flux and orthophosphoric acid aqueous solution on Al, Cu, and 430ss substrates was studied, in which the former flux is a quasi-inert wetting system, and the latter is a typical reactive wetting system, which can be described by a reaction-limited spreading model.

For deriving the equations of motion, both host structure and absorber are modeled as nonlinear SDOF oscillators. The method of harmonic balance is applied to obtain an approximate analytical steady-state solution, which is used for parameter identification. Therefore, the frequency response function of either host structure or absorber is determined experimentally, and the dynamic system parameters are identified by a nonlinear least squares method. Since the focus of the work is on the absorber design, a generalization of Den Hartog’s equal-peak method renders the optimal parameters. These are strongly dependent on the operating point’s amplitude, and consequently, the optimization must be often repeated. To keep this effort minimal, DOE methods are applied in the test and design phase. After confirming a proper absorber design by numerical simulations, a physical model of the absorber is tested in a real-time hybrid simulation setup. Hence, the behavior of the nonlinear host structure is reproduced by a virtual simulation model coupled to the physical absorber using a transfer system. This method allows to focus on the physical absorber without the need to construct an expensive laboratory host structure model. Furthermore, all host structure parameters can be changed in the virtual model, without modifying the real-time hybrid simulation setup. Furthermore, the virtual host structure cannot be damaged or destroyed, and thus, all experiments can be repeated and optimized straight away. So far, all real-time hybrid simulation experiments are in good accordance with the theoretical predictions of this work and corresponding results already published in literature.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Automotive Engineering']"

During their realization and operation, they have an impact on the environment, flora, and fauna but also on economic activities. The induced current, the magnetic field, and the noise produced affect quite large areas in their vicinity. The effect on the environment cannot be separated from the economic aspect regarding distances required in their realization associated with the maintenance costs and the access roads. By applying Fuzzy logic, a balance is realized between these two major issues, economic and environmental. Some factors need to be quantified, including the impact on agriculture, the visual impact, the unusable occupied areas for new roads and housing constructions, also associated with population health, animal life, migratory bird flight routes, TV signals, and radio reception. A multi-criteria model based on Fuzzy inequalities is used to solve this problem. The known values ​​for the electric and magnetic fields are compared with values ​​obtained by numerical modeling, and if necessary, the Fuzzy parameters are corrected. The 400 kV overhead power line from Project 138-Black Sea Corridor, Smardan – Gutinas area is analyzed as a Case Study.

This poses new challenges for private law. The need to contrast an irresponsible model of a consumer society with the necessity to understand nature as a nonnegotiable asset are responses to environmental problems that involve the new civil codes, including in particular those of Argentina and China. Focusing on the concepts of consumo sustentable and lüse yuanze from a comparative perspective, the author emphasizes the so-called “greening” of civil codes, stressing how these principles will not be effective in ensuring the survival of the geo-human system if not coordinated with constitution-based and democratic decision-making. New Latin American constitutions have fostered the elaboration, by legal scholars, of a new critical approach to environmental problems, which appears to be a valid starting point for facilitating the response of private law to ecological issues: that is to say, first of all, to introduce contractual and civil liability systems that will give priority to environmental problems.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Civil Law', 'Fundamentals of Law']"

Indeed, some analysis and simulation, which are applied to static, uniformly distributed, always-on wireless sensor networks with constant data reporting to the sink, show that uniform energy depletion of all the sensors cannot be achieved when the sensors use their nominal communication range in their data transmission to the sink. This chapter presents a theoretical analysis of the energy sink-hole problem. It shows that this problem can be solved provided that the sensors adjust their communication ranges. However, this solution imposes a severe restriction on the size of a planar deployment field. To overcome this limitation, we propose a sensor deployment strategy based on energy heterogeneity with a goal that all the sensors deplete their energy at the same time. Also, it proposes an energy-efficient protocol to solve the energy sink-hole problem using sensor mobility and our newly introduced concept, called energy-aware Voronoi diagram . Our simulations show that EVEN outperforms existing greedy geographical data forwarding protocols and has similar performance of an existing data collection protocol using a joint mobility and routing strategy.

The core premise of Lean is flow of material, information or service depending on the nature of industry. Flow is a universal principle based on the natural order and we are looking to replicate the natural system in our business processes. A four stage approach to creating basic flow is discussed with initial focus being on process design for flow. Facility layout is the single biggest factor that impacts extent of flow and it is important to design the layout to aid the process flow. Once the layout is implemented, flow can be streamlined through practical observation and using tools such as cycle time reduction, line balancing and workstation improvements. Where flow is not possible, pull systems are put in place to maintain a tight control on work-in-progress inventories. Typical shop floor  kanban systems are illustrated with case examples. The next phase in implementation is to sustain flow on a consistent basis. Various types of disruptions to flow can be addressed through appropriate problem solving techniques which are widely available in the public domain.

The cooling system is an essential system to analyze since it affects passenger comfort and the vehicle’s transient responsiveness. In this paper, a thermal load estimation has been developed for the Arteon vehicle cabin travelling in Miskolc. The outside conditions include a minimum and maximum temperature of −3 and 35 ℃, respectively, while the air velocity is between 0.83 and 7.5 m/s. The Arteon’s vehicle air-conditioning system plays a crucial part in providing a comfortable environment. The heat generated in the cabin is a combination of passengers, solar radiation, ambient, exhaust, engine, and ventilation. In this investigation, a negative load was applied to the cabin in order to cool or heat it. The air conditioner (AC) loads have been computed for three distinct time periods, namely three days in each summer and winter month. Based on these data, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was developed to predict the heat load in the car during the year. The agreement with the theoretical calculations was good even if we used a seventh month, namely September, for verification. The maximum error between the thermal load and ANN was 3%, 5%, and 11% for August, December and September, respectively.","['Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering']"

Disrupting the natural homeostasis of the natural environment, this activity is antientropic in nature, since it destroys the connections of the elements of geobiocenosis that have been formed for centuries, and, consequently, negatively affects the stable equilibrium of the natural ecosystem, weakening its carrying and regenerative capacity. This makes it necessary to use the methodology of modeling the reproduction of a stable equilibrium when developing an environmental management strategy and assessing the fixed costs of various types of resources to maintain the reproductive mode of functioning of an artificially created environmental management system. The imbalance between the consumption of natural resources and environmental benefits is fraught with serious, and sometimes irreversible negative consequences, as clearly evidenced by the example of the loss of the Aral Sea. Negative externalities are increasingly manifested at the planetary level, which increases the importance of the problem of systematic consideration of the ecological imperative in the management strategy of natural ecosystems. Based on the results of the study, reasonable recommendations have been developed on the use of nature-like agricultural technologies and renewable sources of energy.

Because PSO has many parameters and variants, we propose a general framework of PSO called GPSO which aggregates important parameters and generalizes important variants so that researchers can customize PSO easily. Moreover, two main properties of PSO are exploration and exploitation. The exploration property aims to avoid premature converging so as to reach global optimal solution whereas the exploitation property aims to motivate PSO to converge as fast as possible. These two aspects are equally important. Therefore, GPSO also aims to balance the exploration and the exploitation. It is expected that GPSO supports users to tune parameters for not only solving premature problem but also fast convergence.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Their main advantages are in the precision and speed of the cut over relatively thick plates and the cleanliness and quality of the welds and coatings. Plasma torches used for cutting and welding are generally of relatively low power, 10 to 40 kW. Their design is based on the use of a hot cathode, operating in a transferred arc mode, with the part to be cut or welded acting as the anode to make use of the high heat fluxes associated with anode root arc attachments. Cutting and welding torches differ, however, in their performance objectives and accordingly in the nature of the plasma gas used. Cutting torches tend to use essentially oxidizing gases at high flow rates in order to enhance the cutting efficiency and get rid of metal dross, while welding torches use inert or reducing atmosphere in order to avoid contamination of the weld spot with debris of metal oxide. Plasma torches used for PTA coating also operate in the transferred arc mode to create a pool of molten metal at the coating location in which the coating materials in the form of a fine powder are uniformly dispersed. Once the molten metal cools and freezes, it creates a metal matrix composite coating, which is often used in hard facing or rebuilding of worn-off parts.","['Engineering', 'Materials Engineering', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Plasma Physics']"

After an overview of the evolution of these two aspects and the role of humans with their respect, we will frame the current and near-future developments according to the job demands-resources model, where humans’ well-being depends on the good balance between job demands (workload, stress, risks, etc.) and job resources, both personal (resilience, optimism, etc.) and job-related (organizational and technological support). Adaptive automation and artificial intelligence have the potential to become job resources rather than job demands, but only if a proper design is set. Central to the design is the notion of plasticity, i.e., the capacity of an element to adapt to changes in its coupling with interacting elements. We will discuss two forms of plasticity in the relationship between humans and technology. Short-term plasticity is mainly based on the immediate adaptation of technology to human needs and performance. The long-term plasticity is based on the co-evolution of humans and technology, where changes concern not just the mere performance, but wider and long-lasting aspects like knowledge, culture, identities, approaches, job frameworks. Organization is crucial to foster this kind of co-evolution, towards a new framework, called transfactory, where human needs and values govern the overall systems evolution.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Machine Learning', 'Robotics and Automation']"

CLT is an engineered wood product composed of dimensional lumber adhered in orthogonal layers. During service, CLT products are susceptible to moisture cycles which can lead to short-term performance and long-term durability issues. Numerical software packages such as WUFI are traditionally used to investigate the hygrothermal performance of CLT materials; however, these programs do not consider the impact of adhesive layers on air and moisture transfer. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a novel 1D heat, air and moisture (HAM) numerical modelling tool that considers the impact of the adhesive layers on the moisture and air transfer in CLT. This paper establishes a novel methodology for the hygrothermal analysis of CLT products which includes the impact of adhesive layers. The methodology and model are validated using existing WUFI software and the simulation of CLT without adhesive layers. The results of the analysis show that the adhesive layers slow the rate of moisture transfer within the wood layers bounded by adhesives. Future research includes a study and analysis of the hygrothermal impact of adhesive layers in CLT in specific climate conditions as well as further validation of the model using laboratory and field testing.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

The article is devoted to studying the use of the ensemble of neuro-learning networks with the strengthening of the securities trading market. The practical significance of the work is to use the model of efficient distribution of investments in the market. This paper will explore a set of models that use in-depth consolidated learning to explore trading strategies to maximize return on investment. The potential of using acting-critical models as an ensemble has been studied. Models such as Proximal Policy Optimizer (PPO), Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) and Deep Determinist Police Gradient (DDPG) were used to teach trading strategy. To adapt the model to different situations, analyzes are analyzed according to three algorithms: the Dow Jones average and a portfolio that minimizes fluctuations in the Charpy ratio by balancing risk and return. The article compares ensembles by the method of fixing deep neural networks. To optimize the balance of risk and profit, the indicators of the ensemble model are analyzed. The ensemble and three-component models that apply well to market collapse conditions are considered.

Hydrofoils allow boats to rise from the water, greatly reducing resistance and increasing performance. The current work dealt with the preliminary design of a daysailer with foil technology and hybrid propulsion that allow to combine green and comfortable navigation both under sail and motor and that, when required, can sail in a more performing way by exploiting the foil technology and the thrust of the wind. After having deepened the theory and physics of sailing on foils, a MATLAB code was created to integrate the stability equations that characterize hydrofoil sailboats: connecting the acting forces and allowing to define the dimensions of the geometries, the code was fundamental in speeding up the iterative preliminary design process. The next step was to model the geometry of the hull and the appendages in the CAD environment and, subsequently, the wing movement mechanism so that it could both manage the incidence of the wings and retract the foils when the boat is moored. The hull, profiles, and wings were subsequently placed in a CFD and VPP virtual environment for testing their resistance. Future developments will include a detailed design and the physical prototyping of a first boat for water testing.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Computer-Aided Engineering (CAD, CAE) and Design']"

Multiple cost functions have been proposed to assist in the decision-making process of cognitive strategies, but it is not yet clear which of these information metrics performs better in the OSL process. Additionally, most of these works have only been validated in simulation or in small controllable conditions such as wind tunnels with the agent starting the search close to the source position, raising additional questions about their performance in real-world scenarios. This work aims to compare the performance of cognitive search strategies between three distinct information metrics: Entropy, Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and Free Energy, and at the same time, evaluate their efficiency in a natural water stream with an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV). All three strategies successfully locate the source in most of the trials, with Entropy and KL showing similar performance. Free Energy had a lower success rate than Entropy an KL but generated more efficient travelled paths, at the cost of a higher computational effort.","['Computer Science', 'Robotics', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Intelligence']"

In the estimation process, the parameters of a given system are formulated into an optimization problem. One of the most interesting estimation problems relies on fractional-order systems. Where functional parameters and fractional orders parameters of the chaotic system are considered as decision variables in an optimization perspective. For this scenario, the complexity of fractional-order chaotic systems tends to construct error functions within a multimodal fashion. Many algorithms based on the principles of evolutionary computation have been developed to be applied to determine the parameters of a given fractional-order chaotic system. Nonetheless, most of them hold a crucial boundary, they repeatedly acquire local optimal values as outcomes, as a consequence of an improper balance among the evolutionary exploration stage and exploitation stage. This chapter introduces an evolutionary approach to estimating the parameter values of fractional-order chaotic systems. To estimate the parameters, the proposed approach employs a newly developed evolutionary technique known as Locust Search (LS) which is based on the conduct of swarms of locusts.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Through literature, we verify that the transport of school backpacks causes a high number of injuries to the children’s spine, due to the transported backpack. The existing solutions start from a bag, where the transported objects are piled up at the bottom, causing above all to increase the depth of the backpack. As a result, the center of mass of the carried load moves away from the spine, increasing the moment arm. In addition to this aspect, the asymmetry of the loads at the bottom of the backpack due to their movement causes pathological problems in the spine. Literature shows that the moment arm augmentation is responsible for a significant increase in flexor moments at the level of the spine, which results in deterioration of the intervertebral discs and the possible occurrence of herniated discs. Also, the asymmetry of loads causes muscle contraction in the spine to compensate for posture and, over time, the occurrence of functional scoliosis. It was possible to understand through benchmarking that there are negative points, or missing ones, whose solution could in fact help to further elevate these products, corresponding to a greater demand on the part of the user. The paper presents an ongoing project under development for a modular backpack, which reduces the arm now while being as close as possible to the spine, through a structure to support the spine beyond the compartments, where it will be possible to fix them for transporting the loads, thus eliminating the asymmetries caused by the loads at the bottom of the backpack, reducing the effect on the spine. Through the personalization of the compartments, the modularity of the backpack will allow to streamline it according to the load daily carried and provide a better interaction between children and the backpack. The use of the HARSim software is relevant for a better understanding of how weight distribution affects the human body and how to study different variations in its positioning. In addition to this, the methodology used in the design project also uses literature review, user centered design and ergo design.","['Architecture / Design', 'Industrial Design', 'Digital/New Media', 'Structural Materials', 'Music']"

Its birth as a science in the late seventeenth century is asserted by the measurements of rainfall and river flow in France establishing the first experimental relation between these two physical quantities. Today highly sophisticated models mimicking the atmosphere-soil-vegetation interactions are used to simulate the flows but its proper calibration depends on good hydrometeorological data. New measuring techniques, like satellite or radar rainfall estimation or Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) for river flow determination, have enhanced the spatial resolution of both estimates allowing, at the same time, a more real-time insight into the rainfall-runoff phenomena. Data storage and dissemination capabilities are also evolving, allowing on-line data transfer between people, institutions and countries. This latter capability combined with the real-time perception of the water status in wide areas coming from hydrometeorological data measurements, improves the capacity for better and faster water management decisions to be taken. Portugal and Spain have signed a treaty in 1998 on Shared Waters which is still being improved steered by new data findings and its sharing. The present paper tackles the issue of what the experience of using new data gathering and transmission brought to the water management coordination between Spain and Portugal (e.g. on flood and drought management), as a good example on finer water-related collaboration.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering']"

Accounts of results produced from reinvigorated attention to the measurement, management, and improvement of the outcomes of health care show that much has been learned, and much remains to be done. This article proposes that causes of the failure to replicate in health care the benefits of “lean” methods lie in persistent inattention to measurement fundamentals. These fundamentals must extend beyond mathematical and technical issues to the social, economic, and political processes involved in constituting trustworthy performance measurement systems. Successful “lean” implementations will follow only when duly diligent investments in these fundamentals are undertaken. Absent those investments, average people will not be able to leverage brilliant processes to produce exceptional outcomes, and we will remain stuck with broken processes in which even brilliant people can produce only flawed results. The methodological shift in policy and practice prescribed by the authors of the chapters in this book moves away from prioritizing the objectivity of data in centrally planned and executed statistical modeling, and toward scientific models that prioritize the objectivity of substantive and invariant unit quantities. The chapters in this book describe scientific modeling’s bottom-up, emergent and evolving standards for mass customized comparability. Though the technical aspects of the scientific modeling perspective are well established in health care outcomes measurement, operationalization of the social, economic, and political aspects required for creating new degrees of trust in health care institutions remains at a nascent stage of development.

Reclaiming unused space that has been abandoned by factories and production processes and restoring the environmental, economic and social quality of degraded neighbourhoods responds perfectly to the concept of a sustainable city. All this should be done by limiting urban sprawl and reducing the environmental impacts which are inherent in the built environment. Indeed, the consumption of land, not previously urbanised, raises the issue of direct and indirect living costs for the environment that need to be taken into account if the underlying perspective is that of sustainability. Another important issue for urban regeneration is the construction of appropriate inclusive decision-making processes. Citizen participation is pivotal for two main reasons: at one hand, it aims to identify, support, develop and sustain sustainability policies, and at the other hand, it is a tool used to achieve shared solutions. However, participation needs to be a continuous and recurring practice in order to be effective and efficient. Hence, to regenerate a city in a sustainable manner means generating more ecological benefits and social opportunities if it is appropriately planned.","['Energy', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Regional/Spatial Science', 'Archaeology']"

The goal is to design an allocation mechanism such that each worker is incentivized to invite her neighbours to join the allocation, although they are competing for the task. Moreover, the performance of each worker is uncertain, which is modelled as the quality level of her task execution. The literature has proposed solutions to tackle the uncertainty problem by paying them after verifying their execution. Here, we extend the problem to the network setting. The challenge is that the requester relies on the workers to invite each other to find the best worker, and the performance of each worker is also unknown to the task requester. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism to solve the two challenges at the same time. The mechanism guarantees that inviting more workers and reporting/performing according to her true ability is a dominant strategy for each worker. We believe that the new solution can be widely applied in the digital economy powered by social connections such as crowdsourcing and contests.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

While the concept, in its modern form, only emerged in the 1980s, Islamic teachings reinforced it since its inception through its rulings that aim to achieve justice and social welfare, reflected in Maqasid Al Shariah (objectives of Islamic rulings). In this paper, we look to explain further, through qualitative secondary research, the link between Shariah and sustainable development and evaluate if Islamic finance, which theoretically should be aligned with the concept of sustainable development given its basis on Shariah, is contributing to its attainment. We find that, while some efforts are being done by Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) to prove this view, IFIs largely lack today in fully aligning their activities with Maqasid Al Shariah which has been limiting their role in the attainment of sustainable development.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

In metropolitan regions, such as Campinas (RMC), population growth and demographic densification are a result of industrialization and water availability, which makes the Hydrographic Basins of these surroundings increasingly committed to supplying the surrounding communities, either by quantity, water quality, among other factors. In this sense, the objective of this research is to analyze a set of water security indicators to support the management of water resources in the Piracicaba, Capivari, and Jundiaí River Basins (PCJ Watersheds), considering the dimensions of Water Security as a reference, according to the National Plan of Safety, in line with the System of Sustainability Indicators Driving Force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR). In this research, it is expected to deepen the knowledge on sustainability indicators for water security in Hydrographic Basins, and for that, it is necessary to verify which indicators contribute to the management of water resources, according to the dimensions of Water Security, pre-established by the National Water Security Plan. The choice of the object of study is justified, as the PCJ Hydrographic Basins are located in a strategic territory from an economic and political point of view. As a result, the study of sustainability indicators contributes to better water security management in PCJ Watersheds, enabling the replication of the study in other Hydrographic Basins.","['Social Sciences', 'Science and Technology Studies']"

In the face of experimental discoveries, analytical formulations emerged as a powerful yet tractable tool in recent theoretical investigations of the role of LLPS in the assembly and dissociation of these condensates. The pertinent LLPS often involves, though not exclusively, intrinsically disordered proteins engaging in multivalent interactions that are governed by their amino acid sequences. For researchers interested in applying these theoretical methods, here we provide a practical guide to a set of computational techniques devised for extracting sequence-dependent LLPS properties from analytical formulations. The numerical procedures covered include those for the determination of spinodal and binodal phase boundaries from a general free energy function with examples based on the random phase approximation in polymer theory, construction of tie lines for multiple-component LLPS, and field-theoretic simulation of multiple-chain heteropolymeric systems using complex Langevin dynamics. Since a more accurate physical picture often requires comparing analytical theory against explicit-chain model predictions, a commonly utilized methodology for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of sequence-specific LLPS is also briefly outlined.","['Life Sciences', 'Biochemistry, general', 'Bioinformatics']"

The increasing use of N-containing fertilizers increases greenhouse gas emissions and groundwater contamination. Biological nitrogen fixation is an eco-friendly source of N that can reduce the use of mineral fertilizers. Biological nitrogen fixation potentially accounts for half of the total N on earth and has been reported to supply approximately 50–128 × 10 9  kg N year −1 in different agroecosystems. However, optimal biological nitrogen fixation depends on phosphorus (P) nutrition. For instance, the conversion of dinitrogen to ammonia by nitrogenase enzyme depends on P as adenosine triphosphate. Here, we review the role of P in biological nitrogen fixation with focus on the increase in the productivity of pasture crops, and the use of mycorrhization in pastures. Mycorrhization, the symbiotic association between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and plants, can account for 80% of total P uptake by plants. Mycorrhization provides optimal soil P required for N transfer from N 2 -fixing forage legumes to non-N 2 and N 2 -fixing forage grasses during intercropping. Intercropping N 2 -fixing forage legumes and non-legumes can fix up to 16–124 kg N ha −1 and contribute about 475–700 kg N ha −1  year −1 on pasture fields. Further, the inclusion of N 2 -fixing and P-mobilizing forage crop species with non-N 2 -fixing and non-P-mobilizing species facilitates root interaction and acquisition of N and P. The association of pasture crop mixtures, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and N 2 -fixing bacteria further promotes crops’ tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses.","['Life Sciences', 'Agriculture', 'Science, multidisciplinary', 'Pollution, general', 'Biotechnology']"

In 2019, the Swiss elected 42% women to the lower chamber (Nationalrat) with no legal quota in force and only few parties with list quota. How did this happen? In Switzerland with its crosscutting cleavages, several institutionalized mechanisms to cope with divisive aspects of diversity have been developed, among others, informal quota and proportional representation. They seem to have spilled over to the question of gender in politics. This chapter analyses the workings of (formal) gender quota on party lists and the significance of (informal) gender quota for the election of national ministers: when parties nominate candidates for legislative and executive office, gender is one feature among others (like region, age, profession or party wing) that should be addressed.

In the case of dying nodes, battery discharge may cause the network to get disconnected. WSN design issues, e.g., location of sensor nodes, scheduling activities, routes of data flow, mobile sink route, should be dealt with keeping energy limitation in mind. The sensor nodes sense the data from the area of concern and communicate the same to the sink for processing. Sensor nodes deployed in various application areas have limited memory, computational power, and battery backup. There is no defined topology of such network and frequently changing environment, very less amount of battery, and limited storage capability of the nodes. It is essential that each node in the network has knowledge about the routing path to the sink which is energy efficient. Since random placement of the nodes restrains coders from presuming routing table data at the sensor nodes, numerous methods have been suggested to create a dynamic path up to sink. Numerous researches are performed for WSN using the mobile sink. Most of the research activities focused on energy conservation in the background while proposing approaches for clustering, data flow paths, trajectory design, etc. In the WSN with a mobile sink, the trajectory of the sink node plays a vital role. Designing of trajectory is an NP-hard problem. With the use of nature-inspired techniques, e.g., particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), etc., can be used for generating a nearly optimal paths for the mobile sink.

A WSN’s expense and structural complexity are all quite relatively less. In a WSN, a sensor node (SN) receives the information from the aerosphere or surroundings. Since a SN has a very low-power battery (LPB), it stops working if a battery power is depleted. Due to the widespread network topology, it is impossible to recharge the battery once it has been depleted. An SN that is not functional can cause the routing protocol to fail. A routing protocol, in most cases, allows an efficient routing path between SNs. Data security via the WSN is always a major concern that must be handled. Almost all of the researchers have discussed their ideas for a WSN routing system that is both energy efficient and secure.

MPTCP congestion control algorithms now in use cannot achieve these design goals. Due to its inability to leverage the network, an MPTCP congestion-control algorithm, such as OLIA, often results in poor performance. With the current Internet’s enormous volume of transient traffic, it is difficult to keep track of MPTCP congestion management techniques.

A gripper attached to the UAV would help in grasping, holding and placing the object of interest during these operations. In this work, we propose and analyze one degree of freedom gripper mechanism that has six links and seven revolute joints. The kinematic analysis is done by treating the gripper mechanism as two four-bar mechanisms that form two loops. A two-stage vector loop method is used to determine the joint angles. In order to statically balance the gripper mechanism, the coordinates of all the joints in the mechanism at various positions of the links are found out. The method of principal vectors is used for the complete balancing of the mechanism. In this method, each vector is directed along with one of the links, and the position of the center of mass of the entire mechanism is given by the addition of these vectors in series. The coefficients of these principal vectors are determined by summing the mass-weighted position vector of every center of mass of the link. Counterweights are added to the links for statico-dynamic balancing of the gripper mechanism. The dynamic analysis is done using the Newtonian solution method. There are 15 equations with 15 unknown contact forces and torque acting in the gripper mechanism. Solving these equations, we obtain the forces acting on the links, and torque required for driving the gripper mechanism. The gripper mechanism was then modeled using a CAD software. It was fabricated by 3D printing the parts and assembling them together. The gripper was finally mounted below a hexacopter and tested in the outdoor environment by carrying and dropping a spherical object.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics']"

School classrooms are considerably challenged during the COVID-19 pandemic because of the increasing need for in-person education, untimely and incompleted vaccinations, high occupancy density, and uncertain ventilation conditions. Many schools started to use CO 2 meters to indicate air quality, but how to interpret the data remains unclear. Many uncertainties are also involved, including manual readings, student numbers and schedules, uncertain CO 2 generation rates, and variable indoor and ambient conditions. This study proposed a Bayesian inference approach with sensitivity analysis to understand CO 2 readings in four primary schools by identifying uncertainties and calibrating key parameters. The outdoor ventilation rate, CO 2 generation rate, and occupancy level were identified as the top sensitive parameters for indoor CO 2 levels. The occupancy schedule becomes critical when the CO 2 data are limited, whereas a 15-min measurement interval could capture dynamic CO 2 profiles well even without the occupancy information. Hourly CO 2 recording should be avoided because it failed to capture peak values and overestimated the ventilation rates. For the four primary school rooms, the calibrated ventilation rate with a 95% confidence level for fall condition is 1.96±0.31 ACH for Room #1 (165 m 3 and 20 occupancies) with mechanical ventilation, and for the rest of the naturally ventilated rooms, it is 0.40±0.08 ACH for Room #2 (236 m 3 and 21 occupancies), 0.30±0.04 or 0.79±0.06 ACH depending on occupancy schedules for Room #3 (236 m 3 and 19 occupancies), 0.40±0.32,0.48±0.37,0.72±0.39 ACH for Room #4 (231 m 3 and 8–9 occupancies) for three consecutive days.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"

In a world made of change and challenges, finding meaning in the apparently random, chaotic, and unpredictable day by day life is the permanent job of our brain, a processor of stories. The confrontation with cancer, as a form of chronic illness, is one of the most challenging events people may came across in life. In Patient-Centred Care, stories and storytelling are regarded as an important tool for practice. We believe that through resonance both can be a valuable resource in behavioural change towards health and contribute to patients’ coping and empowerment. Design can play a fundamental role in this process through Health Design Thinking and its principles.

Cost overrun is a major factor that diminishes the value of construction projects. Saving money without compromising quality is an idea that everyone can promote. Value Engineering (VE) is a systematic approach that can be used to attain better balance between cost, quality and function of a product or facility. The main aim of this research is to identify the awareness level of VE in the construction sector and to compare the value generation for the client in terms of money before and after applying VE principles. In this research, a case study of residential building project is considered and focused on selecting best value-adding material for masonry work using VE phases. Questionnaire surveys are used to identify the awareness level about VE in construction sector and the responses are analyzed using SPSS software. To manage cost overrun in residential projects, this study focuses on recommending alternative proposals for building blocks that add value to the work at low cost without compromising the functional quality. Selection of best alternative is based on parameters such as cost, quality and availability, and material ranking using weighted decision matrix. The findings from the study showed that about 4% cost saving is possible by the application of VE in masonry work of residential project and also suitable recommendations are made based on the data collected.","['Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences']"

Implementation in the Belgian Case",OriginalPaper,"Belgium was the first country in the world to impose strict gender quotas by law for all electoral levels. The initial minimum 25% gender quotas evolved over time into a 50% gender quota, accompanied by a form of placement mandate and by relatively efficient sanctions. Because candidate lists not respecting the quotas are not allowed to compete in elections, the gender quota rules were turned into a practice almost overnight. Nonetheless, it took a while before the number of female representatives increased. Part of the course of this evolution can be ascribed to features of the electoral system, but not all of it. Therefore, this chapter digs deeper into the implementation of the Belgian gender quotas, paying particular attention to how quotas were implemented by political parties acting as central gatekeepers in the recruitment and selection process. Based on a study of party statutes, as well as more than 50 interviews with party officials from all major Belgian parties at two moments in time, it assesses to what extent and how gender quotas became integrated in the recruitment and selection practices and routines of political parties. As the Belgian gender quotas are formulated in such a way that they must be applied, the question is to what extent the implementation of these gender quotas is something considered to be important by political parties, reflected upon, and eventually connected to and put in relation with other initiatives, measures or policies, or just a condition to fulfil.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Politics and Gender', 'Gender Studies', 'Comparative Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Public Administration']"

This approach allows to monitor the distribution of heat flows in real time. The purpose of controlling this process is to create a mathematical model to determine the time interval for restarting the heat flow control algorithm in the heat supply system with a dependent connection to the heat source, on the basis of which a discretization interval of the heat supply system state probing time should be obtained. This approach is accompanied by appropriate microprocessor support according to the “smart home” scheme. The task was set to use the differential heat balance equation to achieve the aforementioned goal. It is expected to use the dependencies of the functioning of the heating system in stationary and quasi-stationary modes, taking into account transient processes in the event of start, shutdown or emergency stoppage. The methods of mathematical analysis are used to obtain the desired relation. In addition, the solution to this problem is accompanied by a graphical illustration in the Mathcad software environment. An important part of this article is a relatively simple schematic and technical implementation of the obtained solution.

For the Basque Country, these flows imply a new migratory cycle which, as on former occasions, helps further diversify an already diverse society. From the point of view of a cohesive society, the integration of these new migrants is a key element. What is the role of social and political participation in the integration process? This paper aims at providing an answer to the question. There may be a variety of forms and models for defining what is understood as integration. However, it is generally agreed that participation is a major factor in this integration process. This consensus is based on the fact that participation is a fundamental, democratic element which is related to political and civil rights, the community system and a society’s citizens. From the democratic viewpoint, having immigrants participate is, therefore, a fundamental aspect. In this work, we intend to analyse the relation between the participation Participation of people of foreign origin residing in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country Basque Country (CAPV) and their subjective perception of integration Integration . To this end, we based our work on the Basque Government’s Survey of the Foreign Immigrant Population (EPIE), a survey that allows us to analyse the subjective perception of integration Integration of people of foreign origin depending on the different forms of engagement and their sociodemographic and migratory profile. The findings helped show the existence of a positive relation between participation Participation and the perception of integration Integration . Furthermore, it was likewise observed that the different participation Participation profiles identified vary depending on the nature of the organisation in which they participate, the migratory stage and their socio-economic characteristics.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Public Policy']"

Its most common historical implementations were for land drainage/reclamation, irrigation, and to convey mixed media (i.e., granular solids, suspended solids, etc.). The screw has also found use as a hydroelectric generator since the earlier 1990s. Due to its robust design, screw pumps are still commonly used for land drainage and wastewater conveyance. Design methods for Archimedes screw pumps (ASPs) are not well documented in the literature. The leading text offering engineering design guidance for ASPs was compiled by Nagel (in 1968) and offers mostly empirical design guidance based on data and experimentation that usually do not appear to be further documented in the literature. Most design techniques are based off a paper presented by Muysken in 1932. The paper uses many simplifications and empirical models based on undocumented experiments, so there is a need to evaluate and update modelling techniques to determine optimized design of ASPs using modern computational techniques. This study investigates the literature of Archimedes screw pumps, and presents and summarizes current modelling techniques. Experimental methods and data are presented and compared to current performance prediction models from the literature. Results are analysed and used to suggest areas for further research and improvement in current engineering design guidance.","['Energy', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Environmental and Sustainability Education', 'Sustainable Development', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Natural Resource and Energy Economics']"
doi:10.1007/124_2021_53,en,Plants in Space: Novel Physiological Challenges and Adaptation Mechanisms,OriginalPaper,"Any space exploration initiative, such as the human presence in the Moon and Mars, must incorporate plants for life support. To enable space plant culture we need to understand how plants respond to extraterrestrial conditions, adapt to them, and compensate their deleterious effects at multiple levels. Gravity is a major difference between the terrestrial and the extraterrestrial environment. Gravitropism is the process of establishing a growth direction for plant organs according to the gravity vector. Gravity signals are sensed at specialized tissues by the motion of amyloplasts called statoliths and transduced to produce a cellular polarization capable of influencing the transport of auxin. Gravity alterations eventually result in changes in the lateral balance of auxin in the root, producing deviations of the growth direction. Under microgravity, auxin changes affect the root meristem causing increased cell proliferation and decreased cell growth. The nucleolus, the nuclear site of production of ribosomes, is a marker of this unbalance, which could alter plant development. At the molecular level, microgravity induces a reprogramming of gene expression that mostly affects plant defense systems against abiotic stresses, indicating that these categories of genes are involved in the adaptation to extraterrestrial habitats. Nevertheless, no specific genes for plant response to gravitational stress have been identified. Despite this stress, plants survive, developing until the adult stage and reproducing under microgravity conditions. A major research challenge is to identify environmental factors, such as light, which could interact, modulate, or balance the impact of gravity, contributing to the tolerance and survival of plants under spaceflight conditions. Understanding the crosstalk between light and gravity sensing will contribute to the success of the next generation agriculture in human settlements outside the Earth.","['Life Sciences', 'Plant Sciences', 'Forestry', 'Plant Biochemistry', 'Ecosystems', 'Plant Genetics and Genomics', 'Plant Physiology']"

Finally, the coupling predictive model of cutting force and cutting temperature under MQL condition is established. Different from other prediction model, the proposed MQL prediction model does not relied upon the measurement of cutting temperature or cutting force, and it can directly predict the cutting force and cutting temperature according to the cutting conditions in the machining process.","['Engineering', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Materials Engineering']"

As responding, caching popular videos in the storage of small base stations (SBSs) has been regarded as an efficient approach to reduce the transmission latency and alleviate the data traffic loaded over backhaul channels. This work considers a small-cell based caching market composed of one mobile network operator (MNO) and multiple video service providers (VSPs). In this system, the MNO manages and operates its SBSs, and assigns these SBSs’ storage to different VSPs, who have caching requirements. However, videos have different popularities and MUs present different preferences to these VSPs when they request videos. In addition, the caching service brings different utilities to different VSPs, as well as that providing caching service to different VSPs causes distinct costs to the MNO. Such privacy information cannot be aware of among VSPs and the MNO. Therefore, to elicit this hidden information, this chapter designs a double auction based caching mechanism, which ensures the efficient operation of the market by maximizing the social welfare, i.e., the gap between VSPs’ caching utilities and MNO’s caching costs. Moreover, the chapter demonstrated economic properties of the designed caching mechanism, which are also validated by simulation results.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication']"

Parabolic trough solar collector (PTSC) converts solar energy to thermal energy and can serve applications like power generation, industrial process heat, desalination, etc. Optimization of governing process parameters for such a system can improve its efficiency and increase its share in different applications. Heat transfer fluid (HTF) flow rate is one of the critical parameters in the working of PTSC. The current study investigates the impact of HTF flow rate on the efficiency of PTSC and estimates the optimal flow rate for a specific system and at a certain temperature. It is revealed that despite increased pumping efforts, increasing the flow rate above a critical value did not guarantee an increase in system performance. This highlighted that an optimum mass flow rate value should be determined that maintains acceptable thermal efficiency while requiring least pumping effort. The value of optimal flow rate has been computed using a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). The best compromise solution identified after a diligent Pareto front analysis was observed at HTF flow rate = 11.34 m 3 /h with pump work = 0.66 W and thermal efficiency = 73.08%.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Mechatronics', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Energy Storage', 'Materials Engineering']"

In this paper, a nonlinear boundary problem for a thin rod is considered.

This paper concerns the reflected waves produced by multiple waves at frequencies $$n\omega$$ n ω incident on the boundary of a semi-infinite rod with linear and cubic nonlinear stiffnesses. Equations are truncated including the third harmonic and solved using the harmonic balance method for the case with two reflected and two incident waves. The effects of different parameters on the magnitudes of the reflected waves are studied. It is shown that the phase difference between the incident waves affects the reflected waves’ behaviour. Numerical examples are presented to find the conditions at which the magnitude of the reflected wave of the 1 st harmonic is minimum and the maximum energy leaks from the 1 st harmonic to the 3 rd harmonic. The results show that the presence of the second incident wave can decrease the magnitude of the reflected wave of the 1 st harmonic.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis']"

One of the inputs to this system corresponds to the prediction of demand and also incorporates a demand management system. The objective of this paper is to design the demand prediction block, taking into account the non-linear behavior presented by the demand. The model is designed to deliver the predictions that EMS needs, that is, for a 2-day horizon. When deriving the model, a stability analysis based on the fuzzy theorems is included in the identification stages. The final model consists of four rules and 96 regressors, that is, the future demand depends on the demand of the previous day. As a result, a model is obtained that manages to deliver predictions for horizons of 2 days, with errors of around 14%. The prediction was also analyzed using the EMS optimizer; the fuzzy model prediction had an error 11% lower than the prediction originally used, which translated into a 15% decrease in costs for the 2-day optimization. The second objective corresponds to developing a methodology to model the variation in consumption in the face of demand management signals, using this fuzzy model.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Statistics, general']"

In this paper, we try to make a case study on classification using Hierarchical Tucker Regression (HTR), which is a novel generalized linear tensor regression model based on the Hierarchical Tucker Decomposition (HTD). This compact, flexible regression model can work well with the data that takes the form of high-dimensional arrays, also known as tensors, with just a smaller number of parameters than traditional vector-based regression models. In addition, we have replaced the canonical dimension tree in the original HTR with the front-to-back splitting dimension tree, which leads to the front-to-back splitting Hierarchical Tucker Regression. This tree structure is a special case of Hierarchical Tucker format that can present Tensor-Train Decomposition (TTD), which provides a condition in determining the general rank bounds for the Hierarchical Tucker rank of HTD based on the rank of the TTD. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on both simulated and real data.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Deliberate institutional initiatives of increasing women’s participation in construction effect a social engineering process to tackle this issue, which is disruptive to the long-standing organisational routines in construction projects. This chapter presents a review of recent institutional initiatives of increasing women’s participation in the industry and examine their impact on the functionality of construction project organisations. The relevant institutional interventions and research were selected for an institutional analysis through a snowball sampling approach, starting from a recent Australian initiative to increase women’s participation in trades. Five institutional logics are identified that are driving and legitimating the gender equality agenda: the masculinity logic, the market logic, the feminism logic, the humanity logic and the femininity logic. The review starts from a focus on ‘women’ and ends with a focus on ‘femininity’. Key findings are: (1) Feminism in the current practice presumes a gender contradiction which mirrors the masculinity logic. (2) Professionalism, the logic of the work, is missing from the current gender equality discourses. (3) A distinction is drawn between the ideology of feminism and the general trait of femininity. (4) Complexity within feminism needs further study. The results suggest to foster the femininity logic through ungendered job roles and a caring, engaging and nurturing on-job practice, illustrated with three examples. The results suggest that the equality agenda move beyond gender politics to anchor itself in professionalism, embrace the femininity values more substantially in job design and appraisal that reward teamwork  to engender a cultural change in the industry.","['Engineering', 'Fire Science, Hazard Control, Building Safety', 'Building Construction and Design']"

Using sewage sludge as a soil fertilizer is a milestone within a circular economy view, although the presence of these OMPs entails potential risks that should be minimized, even if there are no legal restrictions regarding the presence of OMPs in sludge yet. OMPs biotransformation efficiency during Anaerobic Digestion (AD) depends upon the compound characteristics, but it appears quite different on each WWTP. The reasons behind these variabilities are not clear since typical operational parameters of AD seem to exert a minor effect on biotransformation. To overcome the limitations of this process, it is crucial to firstly understand the occurrence of OMPs in sewage sludge, secondly, evaluate the factors and mechanisms involved in the fate of OMPs, and finally find an accurate model to predict the behaviour of OMPs during AD. These are the main issues examined in this chapter.","['Environment', 'Environmental Chemistry', 'Waste Management/Waste Technology', 'Agriculture', 'Pollution, general', 'Applied Microbiology']"

France and the Maastricht Treaty,OriginalPaper,"In retrospect, the profound Euro-crisis of the 2010s cannot be explained without looking back on the period leading up to Maastricht. France’s role in that process, on which this chapter focuses specifically, was pivotal. Maastricht, in many ways, was the highpoint of forty years of French influence in European construction. Alongside the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), France was perhaps the country that influenced the most the Maastricht outcome and, as a result, the emergence and the shaping of today’s EU. At the same time, Maastricht marked the beginning of a long decline of that influence, opening the way to the country’s growing dissatisfaction with the European project, as illustrated by the narrow success of the 1992 referendum on the treaty and, even more clearly, by the rejection of the European constitutional treaty in 2005. This trend continued during the Euro-crisis of the 2010s, culminating in the dramatic French presidential election of 2017. The Maastricht saga, in other words, must be seen as a tipping point for European construction and France’s role in it. But looking back on these events is also important to assess future developments: can French influence in Europe be restored, and can the EU be fixed and relaunched, as called for by the current French President, Emmanuel Macron, since his coming to power?","['History', 'European History', 'History, general', 'Political History', 'Economic History', 'Modern History']"

It has two components, the sympathetic nerves whose signals are generally excitatory and the parasympathetic nerves that are generally inhibitory. These nerves innervate the SA node, the heart’s natural pacemaker, and can raise or lower its firing rate thus raising or lowering pulse rate. These signals also control vasodilation and vasoconstriction. A feedback loop connecting the heart, the capillaries, and the cardiovascular center of the brainstem mitigates transient effects upon blood pressure and pulse rate. The steady-state resting heart rate and blood pressure are homeostatically controlled by an adaptive algorithm, believed to be % Hebbian-LMS.

This requires that governments create national and goals that mirror global ambitions and put in place the necessary institutional mechanisms and monitoring systems to translate these goals into effective implementation. Achieving the SDGs requires addressing the questions related to relevant complementarities and trade-offs to the wider policy domains. This in turn requires having in place policy frameworks that foster horizontal integration given that the SDGs and climate action cannot be achieved by sectoral siloed policies. This multisectoral, comprehensive view of sustainability policies needs to be complemented with a whole-of-government approach that engages local and regional governments (LRGs) to ensure last-mile delivery as well as attracts the private sector to the scene. The implementation of policies needs to be backed by strong high-quality disaggregated data that is capable of informing the decision-making process and strengthens delivery within a data governance framework that promotes trust in data transactions. The cross-cutting theme is that realizing the ambitions of the 2030 Agenda hinges on adequate finance, a factor that has been further stressed by the pandemic. Fiscal policies and public financial management are essential for both aligning the public financial system with the SDGs and unlocking the necessary SDG funds from non-state actors, specifically the private sector. The tripartite of policy framework and effective implementation institutions, dependable data, and adequate finance has been repeatedly stressed in the lessons learnt from the pandemic and other global crises.

This paper considers the Levellers, John Milton, and James Harrington, arguing that while they shared assumptions of popular sovereignty and electoral representation, they can be placed at very different positions on a spectrum between the poles of democracy and republicanism. Their very different constitutional proposals reveal different fears and different attitudes to the role the people should play within a representative system. While the Levellers proposed a clearly democratic system (in modern terms), they also expected an active and spirited people to keep representatives in check. Milton’s constitutional suggestions on the eve of the Restoration show the people as the threat and an aristocratic republicanism as at least a temporary defence. Harrington overtly embraced both the idea of ‘democracy’ and the heritage of the more aristocratic ancient and contemporary republics, forging a remarkable fusion of the two in spite of the anti-democratic elements present in early modern republicanism.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Political Theory', 'Political History', 'Political Science', 'Cultural History', 'Constitutional Law']"

The new topic changes the dynamics between the characters of the dialogue: Finite takes over Infinite’s role and becomes the one leading the conversation. The first part of the depiction of the utopia focuses on its health system. Renaissance utopists typically investigate this topic in detail, yet Agostini’s account stands out amongst those of his contemporaries for its length and broad scope—health is, in fact, the aspect of his utopia to which he devotes most of his attention. Agostini articulates his exposition into four main parts that examine: (1) the natural conditions conducive to health (the site and climate of the city), (2) the urban sanitary measures designed to avoid the rising and spreading of diseases (adequate housing, streets cleanliness, population distribution), (3) the lifestyles promoting health (diet and sleep), and (4) the best ways of restoring health (doctors and physicians). However, in his analysis of the utopia’s health system, Agostini keeps reminding, via Infinite, that though human beings should attend to their physical well-being, their greatest priority should be their spiritual health.","['History', 'European History', 'Cultural History', 'History, general', 'History of Philosophy']"

Reflecting the ontological features of evaluation and agency also explored in Chap. 2 and informing TOWT, the argument here is that the experience of melancholy can facilitate the authentic re-adjustment of life goals and personal values. This re-adjustment involves a person exercising her agency through engaging in self-critical evaluation which re-prioritise her personal commitments and attachments. Therefore, the experience of melancholy, can enable her to focus more authentically on what she genuinely values, and regarding those goals she should subsequently pursue. First, the pleasure and sober self-reflection evoked by melancholy, lead to relatively safe ‘psychological states’ that can more authentically articulate the values a person is committed to most genuinely. Second, this outcome increases a person’s well-being, epistemologically and normatively speaking, as a person can better know and fulfill what is most valuable to her. Third, melancholy facilitates her realising that what she values will not last forever, reflecting the ontological feature of human finiteness , also informing TOWT. Finally, melancholy, in turn, can help her to psychologically process the experience of loss more healthily, and support welfare practices, such as bereavement counselling and reminiscent therapy for older people.","['Philosophy', 'Political Philosophy', 'Employee Health and Wellbeing', 'Social Policy', 'Politics of the Welfare State', 'Social Work and Community Development', 'Comparative Social Policy']"

Since the inaugural “gender quota election” of 2016, the number of women candidates contesting general elections has increased by 90% while the number of women elected has increased by 44%. Yet, in 2022, men outnumber  women by a ratio of 3.44:1 in Dáil Eireann (the lower house of parliament). This chapter discusses the implementation of legislative gender quotas in Ireland. It shows that political parties have met the letter of the law in fielding the requisite numbers of women candidates, but questions remain as to the extent to which the spirit of the law has been embraced to  transform candidate selection processes within political parties. The chapter argues that legislative gender quotas should therefore be understood as the start rather than the culmination of efforts to achieve gender equality within political parties in Ireland. But beyond political parties, we conclude that the introduction of candidate gender quotas in Ireland flagged a significant shift in political culture, which carried through into later political reforms on the unresolved issue of abortion and the newer issue of marriage equality.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Politics and Gender', 'Gender Studies', 'Comparative Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Public Administration']"

In this work, a two-stage humidification and dehumidification (HDH) desalination system has been expanded with the addition of a cooling system. Polygeneration of desalinated water and conditioned air utilizing solar energy fulfills the entire requirement simultaneously. This investigation was done by using two-stage humidification and dehumidification desalination with a vapor compression refrigeration system.

Underwater image analysis plays a vital role, where the images are easily prone to attenuation and haziness. Capturing underwater images has always been a challenging job due to dispersion and scattering of light inside water on a high scale. Several image enhancement and restoration methodologies are currently available to address these issues, where hazing and color diffusion are viewed as a common phenomenon in it. Such procedures normally includes two basic methodologies in it, namely dehazing and contrast or color enhancement, which improves the overall output of the degraded image. However, the quality and processing time of the images can still be enhanced with additional techniques incorporated to it. This work is intended toward proposing one such channel called improvised bright channel prior for dehazing the underwater images. The technique further improves on the existing methodologies by estimating the atmospheric light and refining the transmittance of the image along with image restoration. The experimental results show that the improvised bright channel prior methodology is found to perform better in dehazing underwater images with a balanced intensity in terms of dark and white patches obtained from it. When comparing and contrasting the processing time of the proposed methodology with the existing techniques, it is found that improvised bright channel prior performs better. Also, the quality of the dehazed underwater image obtained from the proposed channel is found to be effective when compared with the existing channels.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Statistics, general', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

One of the common traits of these representations is that they simplify the model of the semiconductor devices inside the mmc . Other than providing a thorough review and comparison of the most popular mmc models in the literature, this book proposes a novel mmc simulation approach based on sub-circuit isomorphism. This approach, originally conceived to analyse modular electronic circuits such as random access memories, can be profitably exploited to simulate mmc s, since it exploits the common behaviour of structurally identical sub-modules inside them by clustering them together. As a result, the isomorphism-based approach allows performing detailed, yet efficient simulations of hvdc systems.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation', 'Energy Systems']"

Wind turbine blade crack damage will cause hidden danger to the operation of wind turbine. The current wind turbine blade defect detection mainly relies on manual inspection, and the image detection technology can improve the inspection efficiency and reduce the unit maintenance cost. In view of the existing wind turbine blade crack defect detection algorithm with low recognition rate and low accuracy, a YOLOv4-based wind turbine blade crack detection method is proposed. First establish the wind turbine blade crack image dataset, then the anchor box parameters in YOLOV4 are optimized by K-means++ algorithm to make the anchor box parameters match the crack defect size; BiFPN is used instead of PANet to achieve better feature fusion, and finally the Focal Loss function is introduced to balance the number of small size defect samples in the data. The comparison tests show that the AP of the improved YOLOv4 algorithm reaches 93.49, which is better than the original YOLOv4 and the other three comparison algorithms, and has better efficiency and practicability.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements']"

This is arguably due to public pressure and a changing zeitgeist there that attributes an important role in addressing social and environmental challenges that societies are facing to corporations. Two recent surveys in the USA report that a majority of respondents favor a more equitable form of capitalism, in which companies prioritize the interests of stakeholder, particularly employees. Moreover, people tend to be more loyal to those companies that follow a purpose which aligns with their core values. This is especially true for younger generations. As a result, we are witnessing the herald of a paradigm shift away from an exclusive focus on shareholders and profit maximization to a stakeholder-centric and purpose-driven business model. I present recent examples from Europe and North America that challenge the prevailing business paradigm and hold out the prospect of its transformation.","['Business and Management', 'Knowledge Management', 'Corporate Environmental Management', 'Business Strategy/Leadership', 'Organization']"

This phenomenon appears to be a powerful and efficient alternative water resource. The aim is to present a comparison between two areas that are characterized by the fog phenomenon, Chile and Italy. Chile is the leading country experimenting with fog harvesting projects; therefore, to apply this technology in other locations, it is relevant to study the climatic and geographical characteristics that permit fog formation and the factors that determine fog collector device efficiency. From this analysis emerged that the fog phenomenon results in very different characteristics in the two analyzed locations. Therefore, its collection process may vary. While in Chile, the system deals properly with fog collection in Chile, it should work with dew collection in Italy. Consequently, thanks to some meteorological calculations, a theoretical investigation about dew collection in Milan has been developed, as a means to understand if dew collection in Milan could be as efficient as fog collection in Chañaral, evaluating the potentialities of two different climatic regions, affected by two other fog phenomena. Moreover, the structural system has been studied to develop an experimental project related to a master thesis dealing with the dew collection in Milan. Furthermore, on-site and in the lab, the investigation is still ongoing, thanks to the European project Cost Action (CA17107).","['Engineering', 'Light Construction, Steel Construction, Timber Construction', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Renewable and Green Energy']"

Coping with the current COVID-19 pandemic is an additional issue. All these barriers contribute to the fact that digitalization in the healthcare sector is moving forward more and more. Without the application of advanced technologies, healthcare organizations would reach their limits. In this context, the use of AI is becoming increasingly important. The potentials are wide-ranging and include applications in diagnostics and therapy, as well as the development of pharmaceuticals. But what challenges are associated with the use of AI in healthcare? Within the framework of a qualitative empirical study according to Mayring, this question has been investigated. Based on a systematic literature review, the following barriers of AI in healthcare have been identified and examined: Disagreement in data protection, lack of compatibility with ethical aspects, quality of training data, knowledge, and trust of physicians in AI-supported systems. The next step in the research design have been expert interviews among medical staff as well as AI developers with focus on AI in the healthcare sector mainly in Germany. According to these interviews, the data are analyzed and evaluated. Based on the results of the study, potential activities have been derived in order to be able to successfully overcome the barriers of AI in the healthcare sector in the future.

However, running of thermal power plant results into the release of objectionable pollutants. One way to have a control on these pollutants is the use of renewable energy sources like solar and wind. However, these sources are intermittently available and hence it is important that the quick backup and balancing is needed when renewable source is not available. In these situations, use of gas turbine is a good option. This paper considers the numerical analysis of the combined intercooled, reheat and regenerative cycle. Objective of this work was to develop ANN model, understand the various parameters, there effect on gas turbine performance and optimize the cycle parameters for maximum efficiency. Analysis shows that for turbine inlet temperature 1200 K and compressor inlet temperature 293 K the optimum pressure ratio is 9 and thermal efficiency is 32%. Analysis of the gas turbine cycle was performed for different pressure ratio, turbine inlet temperature, compressor inlet temperature, and heat exchanger effectiveness. Data obtained from the analysis was then used for the development of the prediction model using artificial neural network. The developed model has root mean square error equal to 0.00018 and the regression coefficient of the trained network is 0.99. This way the developed mathematical model was validated, and it has a good predictability.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In the extremes, mechanistic models can include highly detailed descriptions of a small number of metabolic reactions or an approximate representation of an entire metabolic network. To date, all mechanistic models have required details of individual metabolic reactions, either kinetic parameters or metabolic flux, as well as information about extracellular and intracellular metabolite concentrations. Despite the extensive efforts and the increasing availability of high-quality data, required in vivo data are not available for the majority of known metabolic reactions; thus, mechanistic models are based primarily on ex vivo kinetic measurements and limited flux information. Machine learning approaches provide an alternative for derivation of functional dependencies from existing data. The increasing availability of metabolomic and lipidomic data, with growing feature coverage as well as sample set size, is expected to provide new data options needed for derivation of machine learning models of cell metabolic processes. Moreover, machine learning analysis of longitudinal data can lead to predictive models of cell behaviors over time. Conversely, machine learning models trained on steady-state data can provide descriptive models for the comparison of metabolic states in different environments or disease conditions. Additionally, inclusion of metabolic network knowledge in these analyses can further help in the development of models with limited data. This chapter will explore the application of machine learning to the modeling of cell metabolism. We first provide a theoretical explanation of several machine learning and hybrid mechanistic machine learning methods currently being explored to model metabolism. Next, we introduce several avenues for improving these models with machine learning. Finally, we provide protocols for specific examples of the utilization of machine learning in the development of predictive cell metabolism models using metabolomic data. We describe data preprocessing, approaches for training of machine learning models for both descriptive and predictive models, and the utilization of these models in synthetic and systems biology. Detailed protocols provide a list of software tools and libraries used for these applications, step-by-step modeling protocols, troubleshooting, as well as an overview of existing limitations to these approaches.","['Life Sciences', 'Bioinformatics']"

The second time-consuming part is post-processing, where non-maximum-suppression (NMS) is performed. We accelerated NMS by implementing our new algorithms that are suitable for GPUs, which is about 52% faster than the original PyTorch version [ 16 ].

To deliver this system to target cells, adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are commonly used. In fact, AAV vectors have been utilized to deliver the CRISPR-Cas9 system to induce genomic exon skipping and restore the dystrophin protein in various Duchenne muscular dystrophy model animals. Despite the high transduction efficiency, AAV vector-mediated delivery has several limitations, such as the packaging size, prolonged overexpression of Cas9, immunogenicity against the AAV capsid, and the risk of integrating a part of the AAV genomic sequence into the host cell. To overcome these issues, we have recently engineered a transient delivery system utilizing VSV-G pseudotyped extracellular vesicles (EVs) termed NanoMEDIC (nanomembrane-derived extracellular vesicles for the delivery of macromolecular cargo). NanoMEDIC utilizes an HIV-derived Gag protein to package Cas9 protein and gRNA into EVs. The Cas9 and Gag proteins are fused to a heterodimerizer and conditionally dimerized by the addition of an inducible chemical ligand to recruit Cas9 protein into EVs. sgRNA is packaged into EVs through an HIV-derived RNA packaging signal and is subsequently released by two self-cleaving ribozymes. Utilizing these features, NanoMEDIC can achieve highly efficient packaging of the Cas9 protein and gRNA for genome editing into a variety of target cells and in vivo. Here, we describe a step-by-step protocol, including the gRNA-expressing vector construction and large-scale NanoMEDIC production, for in vivo genome editing.","['Biomedicine', 'Human Genetics', 'Anatomy', 'Behavioral Therapy']"

A typical approach for the estimation is to use a simple combination of initial weight on the ground and fuel consumption in air obtained with fuel tank gauge or by accumulating fuel flow. This approach is insufficient when the flight performance will be estimated as accurately as possible because some of the available measurements are not utilized. Therefore, the forward–backward smoother derived from Kalman filter was applied to the estimation with our revision of the smoother to fuse terminal weight on the ground additionally. According to numerical simulations, our method estimated the weight in smaller errors than not only the typical approach but also a fixed-interval smoother, which is used generally for an off-line estimation problem. Moreover, application to actual flight data showed that our method improved the estimated standard deviation by approximately three percent at maximum compared to the fixed-interval smoother.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

Given the importance of surgical resection for lung cancer treatment, racial disparities in surgical quality were investigated using a statewide quality collaborative. Methods This retrospective study used data from the Michigan Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons General Thoracic database, which includes data gathered for the Society of Thoracic Surgeons General Thoracic Surgery Database at 17 institutions in Michigan. Adult patients undergoing resection for lung cancer between 2015 and 2021 were included. Propensity score-weighting methodology was used to assess differences in surgical quality, including extent of resection, adequate lymph node evaluation, 30-day mortality, and 30-day readmission rate between white and black patients. Results The cohort included 5073 patients comprising 357 (7%) black and 4716 (93%) white patients. The black patients had significantly higher unadjusted rates of wedge resection than the white patients, but after propensity score-weighting for clinical factors, wedge resection did not differ from lobectomy (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78–1.49; P = 0.67). The black patients had fewer lymph nodes collected (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.77; 95% CI, 0.73–0.81; P < 0.0001) and lymph node stations sampled (IRR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84–0.94; P < 0.0001). The black patients did not differ from the white patients in terms of mortality (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.19–2.34; P = 0.55) or readmission (OR, 0.79; 95 % CI, 0.49–1.27; P = 0.32).

Many material options are available on the market, with varied polymer bases and types of additives, among which pigments stand out. However, frequently, the effect of the pigment in the parameterization process and in the final quality of parts is neglected by the suppliers, and that often becomes a problem for printing. Recent studies show that for the same supplier, color variation in Polylactic acid (PLA) filaments is a significant factor for changes in mechanical properties, especially when the pigment is red. There was an opportunity to develop a study in which the color factor is fixed (red), and the influence of different filament suppliers is evaluated in the parametric configuration planning and, consequently, in the integrity of the parts obtained. Red PLA filaments of three brands were selected, which were input elements for a three-part investigation. First, the filaments were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA), and density measurement. In the second moment, a Taguchi experiment was used to evaluate the flexural mechanical properties and mass of the parts, considering the variation of layer thickness, extrusion temperature, print speed and extrusion multiplier, each one with three levels. The best levels of phase two parameter for each supplier were used to create a verification print model which manufactured parts were evaluated by the same responses as in the previous step. Finally, the results were compared to those from a fixed parameter setting from the literature. FTIR, DMA, and density analysis showed that red PLAs from different suppliers have similar responses. Parametrically, the red PLA filaments behaved differently, requiring, in some cases, specifics machines to produce the parts. In all cases, the verification models made the responses better than those identified with a fixed setting from the literature, which demonstrates the need for the user to adapt the system according to the supplier chosen, especially in controlling the extrusion flow rate. In summary, despite using the same polymer base (PLA), different suppliers possibly use their own sets of additives either to modify the color or stabilize the material. This affects the rheology and thermal behavior of the polymers, which requires unique printing settings, altering mechanical properties, and mass of parts. The study also highlights the importance of considering the determination of quality regulatory mechanisms in the production and commercialization of pigmented thermoplastic filaments for 3D FFF printing.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Engineering Design']"

However, component-level parameter variations during the fabrication process of SFQ logic cells are quite high. Therefore, optimizing SFQ logic cells to maximize their operating parameter margin (and parametric yield) under variability sources is a necessity. In this chapter, a hybrid design optimization technique based on Automatic Niching Particle Swarm Optimization and Fireworks Algorithm is presented where the objective is to maximize the upper and lower bound margins of the design parameters of a SFQ logic cell. The proposed algorithm can efficiently optimize both simple and complex multi-stage logic cells with various fan-in and fan-out counts. The proposed method improves the critical margin range and parametric yield values for 6 different logic cells by 22.83% and 15.22% on average, when compared to a previously optimized open-source cell library.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Electronic Circuits and Devices']"

Upon the different theories of economic growth, an understanding of causes why Ukraine has not achieved high long-term economic growth, widening social and economic gaps with other countries and, consequently, not providing an acceptable level of economic security since the 1991. The authors conclude that Ukraine hasn’t seized a window of opportunity provided by market transformation of the economy to increase productivity, which significantly reduced national economic security. Prolonged restrictive monetary and non-stimulating economic policy has led to restraint of money supply, scarce funding and non-strategic structural change, and has prevented effective capacity development and timely expansion of the internal market. It keeps small size of the national economy and led to the outflow of labour and capital resources from the country. The small size of the national economy and absence of significant results in the scalability of the economy are two sides of Ukraine's central economic problem, which leads to a critical compression of development resources and economic reproduction in the long run. Thus, economic policy of Ukraine should be modernized in terms for economic growth and economic security, focusing on measures to radically expand demand (expanding investments, rising household’s income, increasing lending to the economy) while removing barriers to development from the supply side (in such spheres as entrepreneurship, industry, services and agriculture).

By taking the longer-term view this Chapter shows how apparently radical departures are but the latest milestones in a series of cumulative trends. Inter-institutional dynamics have been changing but these evolutionary processes have been under way for a long time, from the decline of centrist representation consolidated within the two traditional major political families, to the parliamentarisation of the relationship between the European Commission and the European Parliament, and the presidentalisation of, and much heavier reliance on programming in, the European Commission. At the same time, other fundamental and distinctive traits in the institutions’ behaviours have continued: the search for maximum consensus in the European Council and the Council; the search for majorities in the European Parliament; and the search for legitimization in the European Commission.

Green roofs (GRs) have shown potential in reducing cooling and heating loads of buildings, and thus, the related carbon emissions. The objective of this research was to analyze the thermal performance of extensive GRs and find suitable GR designs that reduce both cooling and heating building loads under both current and future climates in the City of Toronto. The effect of two design parameters, GR growing media depth and the insulation thickness of the roof, on building energy consumption were investigated. EnergyPlus was used to model GR energy balance for a secondary school building, the total energy consumption and the heating and cooling loads. Due to Toronto being a heating-dominated city, the use of insulated GR with a growing media depth of 200 mm was effective in reducing building total energy consumption. However, results showed that for insulation thicknesses of more than 120 mm under current climate and 80 mm under future climate, the total energy consumption of GRs increased compared to a reference (conventional) roof without GR. Therefore, use of highly insulated extensive GRs to? reduce building total energy consumption is not a suitable replacement for insulated conventional roof for secondary schools in the City of Toronto under current and future climates. Nonetheless, use of uninsulated extensive GRs are suitable choice in reducing the total energy consumption for retrofit schools with poorly insulated conventional roofs.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

A Hybrid Model of Convolutional Networks with a Weighted Average Evolutionary Algorithm,OriginalPaper,"In recent years the field of computer vision has been one of the most advanced in computer science. This is due to the impact of the new techniques in artificial intelligence being deep learning models as the biggest milestone in this field. Computer vision has many applications, but medical diagnosis is one of the most beneficial. Not only in terms of public health, but also in economic benefits. Many medical tests are images, from well-known X-rays to other less used such as thermographies that are cheaper and less invasive. In this paper, we present a hybrid model combining deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks with a weighted average algorithm. The model is trained with thermography images, and we will benefit from segmenting them into the red, green, and blue channels. Then, the weighted average algorithm will calculate the final diagnosis by combining the three previous models. The aim is not only to obtain an accurate model for breast cancer diagnosis but to know what the influence of the different color channels is. Results show that although by separating colors the red channel obtains better accuracy, when using a weighted average algorithm increases by giving more weight to the green color. In this case, accuracy goes near to 97%.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This work addresses the related issue of data allocation, by proposing a novel infrastructure independent method based on the hotspot function of smartphones. In the proposed scheme, smartphones transfer data allowances among mobile users, so that users with excess data allowances act as accessible Wi-Fi hotspots, selling their data allowance to other users who need extra data allowances. To achieve this objective, we propose to use auctions with single and multiple data sellers. Efficient schemes based on auction models are discussed to sell the data allowances over successive days in a month, and over different time slots during a single day. Overall system performance is considered based on the behavior of mobile users, such as changing demands for the sale or purchase of data allowances. Together with the analytical results presented, our simulation experiments also indicate that knowledge of user behavior can significantly improve the performance of data allowance transactions, leading to highly efficient allocations among users.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication']"

Three tests are available: Poisson GLM regression, quasi-likelihood GLM regression, and the negative binomial of the edgeR package. The three models admit blocking factors to control for nuisance variables. To assure a good level of reproducibility a post-test filter is available, where (1) a minimum effect size considered biologically relevant, and (2) a minimum expression of the most abundant condition, may be set. A companion package, msmsEDA , proposes functions to explore datasets based on msms spectral counts. The provided graphics help in identifying outliers, the presence of eventual batch factors, and check the effects of different normalizing strategies.

The authors emphasize that the determining condition for the coordination of insurance interests of market participants is their corporate social responsibility. Based on the above, the purpose of this study is to scientifically substantiate the process of generating insurance relations in the agricultural sector based on corporate social responsibility. The initial data of the study was formed by the results of a poll. The participants of the survey were potential consumers of insurance services, 250 enterprises of various forms of ownership within Zhytomyr, Kyiv and Khmelnytsky regions, as well as 40 insurance companies, branches and regional directorates that position their services in the field of property insurance. The empirical study was conducted using the tools for estimating the minimum required sample size for agricultural enterprises and insurance companies. The results of the sociological survey showed the feasibility of forming a systematic interaction between stakeholders of agricultural insurance. The authors emphasize that the achievement of this interaction requires the introduction of four levels of corporate social responsibility, namely: moral and ethical, communicative, financial and economic and inclusive. This will allow participants in the insurance process to implement closed distribution of risks in space and time effectively, while minimizing agricultural risks at the micro and macro levels. At the theoretical level, it is proven that the key components of financial inclusion in the formation of corporate social responsibility of agricultural insurance stakeholders are “affordability”, “service and quality” and “reliability of insurance protection”. Summarizing scientific developments, the authors of the article have formed certain recommendations and proposals that can be used by state and non-state insurance market institutions to ensure the reliability of the agricultural sector of the economy.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

In practice, ambiguity, debate, and uncertainty encompass academic freedom, both as a professional standard and as a constitutional First Amendment concept. Debates over constitutional academic freedom extend to whether it exists as a legitimate legal doctrine at all, either as an individual right faculty can claim or one shared with or exclusive to higher education institutions. Likewise, academic freedom as a professional norm faces increasing strain. Tenure, devised as the principal employment arrangement to uphold academic freedom by providing financial security to faculty, is increasingly only available to a declining percentage of professors. This chapter examines definitions and conceptions of academic freedom as a professional norm in higher education and as a constitutional concept.

It covers the period from its publication in 1910 to 1966 the year Monopoly Capital by Paul Sweezy and Paul Baran came out. I will show that the ideas associated with Finance Capital dominated economic thinking in the left during the second and third decades of the twentieth century. In the 1930s the Great Depression marked a setback for the book’s prestige. However, important economists, like Natali Moszkowska and Paul Sweezy, who elaborated on the realization/underconsumption version of monopoly theory during that period, initiated fresh interest in this line of thought. It was the conclusion of an intellectual effort that stemmed from the insights of Rosa Luxemburg. Their input established a scientific paradigm that gained recognition in the economic profession. Moreover, it offers an analytical explanation for the booming growth of finance following 1980 and the economic crisis which began in 2007/2008. The most serious criticism toward Hilferding, Moszkowska, and Sweezy is that their conclusions rely on the neoclassical theory of perfect competition and its “dark side”, that is monopoly “price setting”. Neoclassical monopoly pricing means the rejection of the labor theory of value and constitutes a different argument from the one in Marx.","['Economics', 'Social Choice/Welfare Economics/Public Choice/Political Economy', 'Political Economy/Economic Systems', 'History of Economic Thought/Methodology', 'European Politics']"

Based on this premise and the high demand promoted, especially in the Covid-19 pandemic, the market has adapted to the growing demand for residential furniture. Therefore, a conceptual restructuring needs to be carried out due to the great variability of products in the same factory, driven by the target audience, which goes beyond the traditional concepts of factory standardization and enables a new way of thinking according to the demand for products offered by catalog and/or bespoke. In addition, as they are family businesses, there is an inherent risk of closing activities due to the lack of family motivation of the following generations linked to the lack of knowledge to update manufacturing processes. This article concludes that the variability of products offered in each factory is a high option. New concepts must be adopted from handcrafted to manual transition.

This paper explores the effect of sliding velocity and slide-to-roll ratio factors on surface wear in symmetric high contact ratio spur gears (contact ratio > 2) with geometric changes induced by profile corrections. In this work, the sum of profile correction factor is maintained constant at 0.2 by distributing the profile shift ( x 1 ) of the pinion from −0.3 to 0.6. The optimal value of x 1 is obtained by balancing the sliding velocity and slide-to-roll ratio at the beginning and end of the contact path. Based on the generalized Archard’s wear equation, the respective sliding wear is obtained for the optimal balanced point. The simple formulation of the model allows in obtaining the required profile modification to ensure a pre-established function of minimizing surface wear. The influence of balanced sliding velocity and slide-to-roll ratio on tooth wear is studied and compared. The input for the problem is attained from the 2D elastic model using ANSYS. From this analysis, the surface wear for minimum peak-to-peak in both the face and flank regions has been obtained. The study concludes that modification of profile shift coefficients will provide the gear designers the flexibility to optimize surface wear and its respective efficiency.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics']"

The local thermal comfort in the room will be dissatisfactory and the thermal performance of radiant floor will be strongly affected. However, in many current calculation models, solar radiation on the floor surface is assumed to be uniformly distributed, resulting in the inaccurate evaluation of the thermal performance of the radiant floor. In this paper, a calculation model based on the theory of discretization and the RC thermal network is proposed to calculate the dynamic thermal performance of radiant floor with the consideration of unevenly distributed solar radiation. Then, the discretization model is experimentally validated and is used to simulate a radiant floor heating system of an office room in Lhasa. It is found that with the unevenly distributed solar radiation, the maximum surface temperature near the south exterior window can reach up to 35.6 °C, which exceeds the comfort temperature limit and is nearly 8.5 °C higher than that in the north zone. Meanwhile, the heating capacity of the radiant floor in the irradiated zone can reach up to 171 W/m 2 , while that in the shaded zone is only 79 W/m 2 . The model with the assumption of uniformly distributed solar radiation ignores the differences between the south and north zones and fails to describe local overheating in the irradiated zones. By contrast, the discretization model can more accurately evaluate the thermal performance of radiant floor with the influence of real solar radiation. Based on this discretization model, novel design and control schemes of radiant floor heating system can be proposed to alleviate local overheating and reduce heating capacity in the irradiated zone.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"

He published more than 300 articles in total. Most of his journalistic work was devoted to political and economic analyses. As a journalist, he has described and commented upon the major economic events and crises of his lifetime, the crisis of 1907/1908, the German Revolution of 1918/1919, the rise and fall of the Weimar Republic and the Great Depression of 1929–1935. During the years of exile, from 1933 until his untimely death in 1941, he has contributed a vast number of newspaper articles, explaining and criticizing the economic and political events in Nazi Germany, depicting and analysing the transformation of the German economy into a war economy, and demonstrating the inherent weaknesses and fragilities of the kind of dictatorial capitalism, as well as pointing out how the Nazi state was pushing ever further into the catastrophe of total war. In his journalistic work, he touched on many topics that he planned to include in a revised and extended version of his masterpiece “Finance Capital”.","['Economics', 'Social Choice/Welfare Economics/Public Choice/Political Economy', 'Political Economy/Economic Systems', 'History of Economic Thought/Methodology', 'European Politics']"

Healthcare systems need to change to support this unbalance. The have to move to enhanced, value-added and cost-effective services to patients, professionals and caregivers. Industry is already involved in this process, supported by new technologies such as artificial intelligence, deep learning, data analytics and robotics. A parallel approach for Healthcare -called Health 4.0- now opens new opportunities. Quality and personalized services require large amounts of data, which needs to be gathered in a transparent way. Assistive devices are already extensively used among the aging people. Transforming them into smart assistive devices provides the opportunity to monitor different parameters along their usual routines. In this paper, we explore the use of smart rollators in a ROS2 ecosystem to provide user condition services to the caregivers in order to reason about gait abnormalities and functional fitness conditions.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Citizen science has been shown to be a very good tool for providing useful data for scientists, if well directed. For example, the monitoring of invasive species is impossible to do from research institutes due to lack of money, tools and personnel. But well trained, even sporadic tourists can give useful information about their distribution. This is also true in the case of rare or endangered species, or in migrations or the detection of anomalies. They can also be useful in tracking marine litter, not only helping to clean beaches and seabed, but also observing the origin of that waste thanks to photos or collections that can be used to understand where the objects come from. Other observations and data collection are more complex, and require specialists to make adequate quantitative observations, but may still benefit from broad support from people who want to help in the logistical part. Once again, indigenous people are put in the spotlight, because they help to solve many problems thanks to their great local wisdom. We are realizing that many of the things we do to monitor and give keys for conservation are provided by local populations who have lived in, protected or managed the areas we want to study for hundreds of years or millennia. That is why it is important to accelerate the follow-up processes by broadening the spectrum of people who can help in these processes, professionals and non-professionals alike. However, there are limits. Specialist teams are still needed to do sampling, monitoring or experiments. The tools used by scientific research teams to make such monitoring programs have substantially advanced. The technology to keep track of the problems we have in the oceans has made a really important qualitative leap. For example, although attempts have been made to track oil spills in certain circumstances, only the collection of data by specialists can help to understand the origin of contaminants. Coastal and ocean governance needs a paradigm change. We need co-governance processes in which democratic decisions, education and awareness-raising fit together. The models in which people interact with science, problems and solutions about the oceans are more and more demanded, and the last two decades have been crucial. An authentic bottom-up process in which all these advances and the different ways of observing nature and the impacts suffered are available to non-specialists. Without that bridge, we will not be able to create the necessary conditions to reverse the process of deterioration of our oceans.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"

The work also focuses on managerial ownership for moderating the effect between intellectual capital and performance. The alluded conceptual framework is valid for overall industries. This work uses a population of the Malaysian oil and gas industry. The census sampling technique is used. Based on prior studies and resource-based view theory, the study argues that the rise in organization value is directly related to the increased investment in intellectual capital. Besides, the document uses agency theory for conceptualizing managerial ownership for its multiplying effect between intellectual capital and performance. The study proposes a renowned “VAIC” model for computing intellectual capital. The document uses three performance indicators from management, shareholders, and the market perspective.

This is because in most of the studies, pure N 2 (instead of N 2 /H 2 mixture) was introduced over the cathode. In the studies on NH 3 synthesis, the Faradaic efficiency, Λ , attains very low values, and, in most cases, the phenomenon is “sub-Faradaic,” i.e., Λ  < 1. The Λ values are substantially larger when a mixture of N 2 and H 2 , rather than N 2 alone, is introduced at the cathode. In the reaction of NH 3 decomposition, the picture is improved: in all cases, Λ  > 1 and values of the order of 100 have been reported. For either reaction (synthesis or decomposition), the ρ values are comparable to those reported in previous NEMCA studies: a maximum ρ  = 220 has been reported, while typical values are between 2 and 10. The NEMCA characteristics in NH 3 synthesis were poor primarily because its thermodynamic equilibrium limits the yield and, therefore, electrical energy must be supplied to the system in order to attain the desired conversion.","['Chemistry', 'Catalysis', 'Electrochemistry', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering', 'Materials Science, general']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-19467-2_4,en,Fishing and Overfishing-Sustainable Harvest of the Sea,OriginalPaper,"The impacts of industrial fishing have been present in the oceans for over one hundred years, but the exponential increase all over the world and the systematic exploitation of different areas started after world war II. The phenomenon of fishing has to be understood in order to understand the changes in the oceans, and such deep transformation is essential to capture the essence of the resilience: the collapse of fish stocks, the lack of biodiversity, and the profound transformation of ecosystems due to overfishing is in part responsible for the ocean’s impacted functioning that we witness today. It now seems that the collapse of many habitats is to blame for rising acidification or temperature, but the reality is that the impact of overfishing on pelagic and benthic systems is largely responsible for the profound transformations we see today. Trawling has devastated entire ecosystems, destroying the complexity of marine forests, both those that are dominated by vegetal organisms (macroalgae and phanerogams) and those dominated by animals (corals, gorgonians, sponges, etc.). It has been possible to verify that it is not only the destruction of the structures, but the compaction of the sediment and the continuous resuspension that made possible the impoverishment of the communities and therefore of the impoverishment of the fishing stocks. Beyond these impacts, pelagic fisheries have seen profound changes in populations, which evolve to the sound of fishing pressure. The minimum size of successful reproduction (i.e. the size in which the fish is lying eggs to promote the continuity of the populations), for example, has been drastically changed in many species, making possible for populations to survive despite the immense pressure of the predator, us. In addition, these fisheries highlight the fact that many animals are trapped with nets and long lines (dolphins, turtles, birds, etc.). The solutions to these problems are sometimes difficult to apply. These large organisms are usually essential for the health status of the ecosystem and the maintenance of the biodiversity, but we are impacting them in such a way that they have become irrelevant from an ecosystem functioning point of view. The so-called by-catch of smaller organisms is another huge problem. Discards (sometimes more than 50% of fisheries) profoundly harm and transform the ecosystem, and are difficult to sell in the fishing market. Solutions have been sought for decades and this collateral damage has been denounced, but there is still a long way to go. There is also a long way to go to eliminate the high percentage (calculated in more than a quarter of the fish landings of the entire planet) of those known as illegal, unreported and unregulated fisheries. This type of mismanagement of the sea is at the heart of the active policies of many countries, but without transparency and transnational actions, it will it will be difficult to reach a good agreement to suppress or minimize them. In fisheries models, apart from direct impacts, the effects of climate change have long been implemented. As already explained in the previous chapter, rising temperatures and the effects of acidification are transforming the landscape of primary and secondary productivity. The most obvious of these changes is the fact that there will be less fishing, and therefore less production. The effect of lower productivity is already felt in several long-lasting time series, where fishing is being affected by the decrease in phytoplankton. But, in addition, there are less obvious effects. One is the substitution of species, because some are more vulnerable than others to the increase in temperature, so that in the same taxonomic and functional group those who are best adapted to the new conditions win. Another is the expansion of invasive species that directly affect the food chain, and that may feel more comfortable with the new “rules” of fisheries impact and climate change. Some animals are already undergoing these changes, such as cetaceans dying of starvation in certain areas where the synergistic effects of fishing and climate change are felt. The co-governance of fisheries, in which scientists, politicians and society work together, is essential to move forward. They are not hollow words; they are real needs in a world of an excessively accelerated change.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"

It thereby shows how relational dynamics improved the attractiveness of geopolitical discourse within intra-EU struggles over external identity between 2012 and 2021. This account of EU identity formation implies considerations for theory and practice. First, that connecting dynamics in international relationships to intra-polity dynamics is a fruitful way to specify claims about how polities affect identity formation processes. Second, and related to the book’s aim, that tensions and challenges facing the EU should be productively engaged as inherent products of its ongoing adaptation to its environment, a process which entails both obstacles and opportunities.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Legislative and Executive Politics']"

Additionally, we developed a factory model reflecting the actual electricity consumption patterns and implemented multiple electricity procurement methods for the factory: market procurements, photovoltaic power generation (PV), fuel cells (FC), and batteries. Using this simulation model, we analyzed the total $${\textrm{CO}}_{2}$$ CO 2 emissions and total cost of carbon neutrality by changing the factory’s capacity for PV, FC, batteries, and the generation cost of FC. As a result, we found that batteries can enhance the effects of PV. Furthermore, unfortunately, when the capacity of the batteries is larger, the generation cost of FC for FC activation will be required to become lower, which leads to a discussion of the future price target of FC.

We can learn this art today thanks to the texts written and printed during that period. In his most famous drawing, Leonardo da Vinci Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) shows a man drawn inside two geometrical shapes: the square with the center at his groin and the circle with the center at his navel. But there is another possible representation that provides an anthropometric revelation with his center at the solar plexus. That is the man I define as dynamic. Many traces of him may be found in the Masters’ texts and we have magnificent examples of him in daily life: the man who, through performing perfect combat moves, is able to move and “become” a sphere, the “ Palla Palla (ball) ,” or ball, as Camillo Agrippa Camillo Agrippa calls it, with changing circumference and surface. He can move his center within his own body and outside of it, to the palm of his hand, to the blade of his sword, and even to inside his enemy. The dynamic man represents the development upon both the natural man, depicted in a square with his groin at the center and the speculative man, depicted in a circle with his navel at the center. This man creates a sphere around himself, with the solar plexus at its center. He has the ability to move that center to any part of his body, even to his blade and as far as the blade’s end, thus modifying the circumference of his sphere as he pleases.

Isotope approaches have recently been applied to track air, soil and water pollutants, to identify the provenance of archaeological artifacts, and to reconstruct diet and migration paths of past animals and humans. In this framework, isotope tracers can be efficiently coupled to more traditional investigation techniques to solve forensic issues, including linking a suspect to a crime scene, identifying crime victims and the guilty of an environmental crime, tracking the provenance of drugs, identifying explosives.

Many of the perspectives considered before the revolution, especially that of “workers’ control”, clashed against a reality much more complex than that of Lenin’s political predictions.

It delineates the Palestinian economy’s dependence on external income over two distinct periods—the evolution of economic activity and public revenues under the Israeli military governments between 1967 and 1993, and the prevalence of external income and the fiscal composition of the Palestinian Authority since 1994. This historical approach is used to assess whether the Palestinian economy was inherently dependent on external income prior to the PA’s establishment. The chapter concludes that economic activity and public revenues in the West Bank and Gaza have historically been shaped by Israel’s political and economic policies and disproportionately relied on external income. It demonstrates that the fiscal character of the West Bank and Gaza has predominantly been defined by external income since 1967. It points to the increase in this reliance since the creation of the PA with its public revenues composed of 76 per cent of foreign aid and the Israeli-controlled clearance revenue. In addition, the Palestinian economy is found to be rent-driven, with a rent-to-GDP ratio of 37 per cent.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Middle Eastern Politics']"

Hence, the respective methods that have been used in the existing literature to generate the so-called typical weather years (TWY) are mainly based on the use of multiyear historical records of meteorological stations located in the peripheral zones of cities. As a result, complex interactions between solar radiation, wind speed, and the specific morphological characteristics of the area under investigation cannot be accounted. In parallel, the use of historical climatic records for dynamic energy performance simulations does not allow the consideration of the ongoing climate change, having a major impact on the urban built environment with respect to the heating and cooling energy requirements of buildings. It becomes thus obvious that the road towards the accurate investigation of the performance of high-energy performance buildings such as the net zero energy buildings would require a holistic selection of suitable weather data that can account the warming from climate change and the urban warming issues. In this context, the current chapter systematically reviews the studies that investigate the effect of the hourly climatic files, introduced as an input boundary condition on the dynamic building energy performance simulations, and their acquired results are presented and discussed. More precisely, the review focuses on studies that have been based on traditional methods for the acquisition of the required weather datasets but also on the results of other scientific studies that develop future weather datasets for building energy performance simulations, incorporating the future climate change and the urban microclimate issues.","['Energy', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management']"

The cell problems are solved on a microstructure geometry of brain tissue with capillary embedded to obtain effective parametric tensors, namely the capillary and interstitial hydraulic conductivity ( $${\mathbf{K}}$$ K and $${\mathbf{G}}$$ G ), capillary and interstitial homogenous Biot’s coefficient ( $$\alpha_{c}$$ α c and $$\alpha_{t}$$ α t ), Young’s modulus ( E ) and Poisson’s ratio ( v ). By varying the tortuosity, the percentage difference of $${\mathbf{K}}$$ K is 97.98%, shows that it is highly affected by tortuosity. The percentage difference of $${\mathbf{G}}$$ G is 0.25% implying that tortuosity insignificantly affecting $${\mathbf{G}}$$ G . Meanwhile, $$\alpha_{c}$$ α c and $$\alpha_{t}$$ α t decreases and increases with tortuosity, respectively. The percentage difference of E and v are 0.14% and 0.03% respectively, implying that both parameters does not affected by tortuosity.

Surface waters of the lagoon were always slightly oversaturated in CO 2 with respect to the atmosphere with an average pCO 2 value of 496 ± 36 ppmv. Seasonally, subsurface water pCO 2 values were controlled by both temperature and biological/tidal advection effects that compensated each other and resulted in weak annual variations. High-resolution temporal pCO 2 records reveal that the highest fluctuations (192 ppmv) occurred at the tidal/diurnal scale as a result of biological activity, advection from the tidal flat, and porewater pumping that all contributed to water pCO 2 and carbonate chemistry variations. Total alkalinity (TA) versus salinity plots suggest a net production of alkalinity in the lagoon attributed to benthic carbonate dissolution and/or anaerobic degradation of organic matter. We specifically highlighted that for the same salinity range, during flooding, daytime pCO 2 were generally lower than nighttime pCO 2 values because of photosynthesis, whereas during ebbing, daytime pCO 2 were higher than nighttime pCO 2 values because of heating. Waters in the lagoon were a relatively weak CO 2 source to the atmosphere over the year compared to other estuarine and lagoon waters elsewhere, and to sediment-air fluxes measured simultaneously by atmospheric Eddy Covariance (EC) in the Arcachon lagoon. Because of low values and small variations of the air-sea pCO 2 gradient, the variability of fluxes calculated using the piston velocity parameterization was greatly controlled by the wind speed at the diurnal and, to a lesser extent, seasonal time scales. During the emersion, the comparison of these pCO 2 data in the tidal creek with EC fluxes measured 1.8 km away on the tidal flat suggests high heterogeneity in air-sea CO 2 fluxes, both spatially and at short time scales according to the inundation cycle and the wind speed. In addition to tidal pumping when the flat becomes emerged, our data suggest that lateral water movement during the emersion of the flat generates strong spatial heterogeneity in water–air CO 2 flux.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Freshwater & Marine Ecology', 'Environmental Management', 'Coastal Sciences', 'Water and Health']"

In the last 50 years, the country experienced an enormous growth in population (+30%) and in kilometers travelled (+300%), but the mortality rate dropped by 80%. Many effective interventions were taken. Over time, new insights in traffic risks and causes of crashes led to the adoption of a new road safety vision in the early 1990s: Sustainable Safety, the first attempt worldwide of a Safe System approach (1992). This vision was inspired by the UN-Brundtland report Our Common Future (1987) and applied to road safety. Its basis originated in the knowledge and experiences in the decades before. In a sustainably safe road transport system, risks of crashes and serious injuries are drastically reduced or even eliminated by an infrastructure that is adapted to the limitations of human capacity by proper road design, by vehicles fitted with ways to simplify the tasks of man and constructed to protect the vulnerable human being as effectively as possible, and by road users who are adequately educated, informed, and, where necessary, controlled. If crashes still do occur, serious injuries must be excluded. The vision Sustainable Safety has been translated into a set of characteristics and into Sustainable Safety principles. Sustainable Safety was welcomed by Dutch road safety professionals and received great political support. A massive implementation program was initiated and carried out as from 1995. Many stakeholders were engaged. An evaluation study covering the period 1998–2007 revealed a 30% reduction in the number of fatalities. Benefits of the investments were four times higher than costs. Sustainable Safety empowered and strengthened the Dutch road safety research community and heavily influenced the discourse on road safety in the country. As from 2000, several developments (a different planning structure of road transport, less political priority for road safety – perhaps as a result of successes in the past – and decentralization of policies) caused that Sustainable Safety became less prominent and safety effects less visible. However, the vison and the principles remain a solid basis for making progress towards a casualty-free road transport system and to respond to new developments, such as a changing demography, changing transport modes and traffic patterns, and new technologies. Two more editions have been published (2005 and 2018). Results and impacts are being discussed.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

A need still exists for a maturity model that covers the most important factors of the existing validated models and proposes an approach to maturity evaluation. The aim of this study is to design a new maturity model for measuring and analyzing safety culture. Fourteen safety culture maturity models that had been assessed for validity or reliability were selected, analyzed, and compared. The most common themes and evaluation criteria for safety culture were used as a basis for the new model. The five main themes of the model were communication, training, organizational learning, management commitment, and employee commitment and involvement. The model evaluates maturity by combining written descriptions of best practices and the overall satisfaction of employees in the evaluated aspects. The perspective of employee satisfaction with safety culture acknowledges the need to fit the practices into contextual needs. The model is unique because of its balance between rigor (validated content from the literature) and relevance (written evaluation levels).

In addition, the total cost imposed for late payment must meet the following two conditions: First, the total cost should not exceed the cost that the client bears in the traditional bank, with the condition that the total cost of the penalty is not doubled on the late installments or the due principal amount. Secondly, after calculating the total cost imposed on the client for the late payment, the Islamic bank must submits a written request to the Central Bank, explaining the justifications for imposing late payment fees, the circumstances that led to the imposition of late payment fees, and attaching working a plan after its approval by the Shariah Committee of the Islamic bank.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

We used text mining augmented by topic modelling to analyse abstracts of 15 310 peer-reviewed papers (from 2000 to 2020). We identified nine major topics; “Research & Policy”, “Urban and Spatial Planning”, “Economics & Conservation”, “Diversity & Plants”, “Species & Climate change”, “Agriculture”, “Conservation and Distribution”, “Carbon & Soil & Forestry”, “Hydro-& Microbiology”. The topic “Research & Policy” performed highly, considering number of publications and citation rate, while in the case of other topics, the “best” performances varied, depending on the indicator applied. Topics with human, policy or economic dimensions had higher performances than the ones with ‘pure’ biodiversity and science. Agriculture dominated over forestry and fishery sectors, while some elements of biodiversity and ecosystem services were under-represented. Text mining is a powerful tool to identify relations between research supply and policy demand.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Physical Geography', 'Environmental Management', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

The debate is currently focused on the possibility of using algorithmic decisions also in the administration of justice: the use of algorithms which are capable of making choices should help overcome the propensity for eventual human-decision errors, in favour of the theoretically more certain efficiency of algorithmic decisions. The creation of a predictive justice system, however, raises doubts, especially in consideration of certain factors that might alter the algorithmic logic, e.g. the quality of data and the possibility of system error, which could lead to situations of indirect discrimination. With reference to the concerns and risks of the use of AI for justice purposes, in December 2018, the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice adopted the “Ethical Charter on the use of AI in judicial systems and in related areas” that identifies 5 fundamental principles capable of guaranteeing efficient implementation: 1. respect for fundamental rights, 2. non-discrimination, 3. quality and security, 4. transparency—fairness-impartiality in data processing, 5. possibility of control by the user—‘under user control’. The proposed paper, after a brief survey of the critical aspects of the use of AI systems and an analysis of the contents of the EU Ethical Charter, will focus on the possibility of using AI for forecasting and non-decisional purposes, highlighting how the forecasting method can optimize use, especially in civil law systems.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The COVID19 pandemic not only doubled the number of teleworkers, but reinforced these challenges, by forcing some organizations and employees to abruptly adapt to this new reality. In this manuscript, we aimed to explore the role of the strategies implemented by leaders to manage their teams in employees’ sense of professional isolation, burnout, and perceived performance. Thus, data was collected from 1149 teleworkers during the COVID19 pandemic, who answered an online questionnaire. At that time, 79% were working exclusively from home, and 91% had never had a previous experience of working remotely. The results showed that the strategies implemented by leaders to manage their teams contributed to reduce employees’ sense of professional isolation which, in turn, is associated with lower feelings of burnout and higher perceptions of performance. The study reinforced the role of leadership in the context of teleworking and, specifically, the importance of leaders being attentive to team members’ specific needs in order to help improving their wellbeing.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Occupational Medicine/Industrial Medicine', 'Industrial and Organizational Psychology']"

Entrepreneurship may be found almost anywhere. We use a variety of products and services provided by businesses in our daily lives. Entrepreneurs are responsible for the creation of these businesses. Entrepreneurship not only helps to start new enterprises in a variety of industries, but it also has a favorable impact on economic development. Many researchers have emphasized the importance of entrepreneurship to economic development, and it is now widely acknowledged that educational and training opportunities play a critical role in cultivating future entrepreneurs and developing the abilities of existing entrepreneurs to grow their businesses to greater levels of success. Similar is the case in deciding upon traits, characteristics, and skills reflected by an individual that entitles him as an entrepreneur in the due course. Numerous literatures have pondered upon the fact that there are certain desired skills that add up to form the overall personality of an entrepreneur. These skills are integral aspects of formation of what is called an entrepreneurial persona. The chapter discusses various types of ventures and categories of entrepreneurs along with enlisting and elaborating various skills for entrepreneurs, which have to be reflected by an individual to be a successful entrepreneur. Insights have been cumulated from different literatures highlighting broad categories of entrepreneurial skills. The varied nature of entrepreneurship is presented in this chapter, which displays common outcomes as well as many points of disagreement.","['Life Sciences', 'Agriculture', 'Microbiology', 'Microbial Genetics and Genomics']"

Natural opposition to the idea of all British officers being armed comes from rights groups, primarily concerned about the right to life implications for victims: not only in the greater risk of arbitrary killing by the State but also the impunity for offending officers. This reticence about the routine arming of the police reflects the classic liberal belief that citizens must be protected from the actions of the State, especially where fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, are threatened. But does this traditional approach unduly monopolise the human rights debate? The purpose of this piece is to explore conceptual arguments relating to the right to life: has the traditional approach to the right, largely concentrated on the arbitrary killing of civilians, unfairly dominated the rights discourse?

From the numerical model, proposed in Sadio et al. (2018), the optimal combination between PV and battery capacities is found out, by taking into account the annual monthly irradiation variation and the simultaneity coefficient. So, all average monthly values of solar irradiation are considered instead of one average value and the maximal value of load demand is used and determined from energy balance and consumers behavior. After generating all PV/batteries combinations for each value of solar irradiation, the best configuration is chosen by using the TLCC. It is shown that the PV and battery capacities decrease by 25.13 and 88.39%, respectively, when compared to the intuitive method. However, the obtained LPSP, assessed to 0.3, is considered as high and is due to the lack of complete data.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

To this end, physically-based semi-distributed and conceptual models are investigated using climate reanalysis datasets and geomorphologic catchment characteristics. Prior to feeding model forcing variables, their statistical and spatial patterns, methods of potential evapotranspiration estimations, and basin drought conditions are studied. Two or more approaches have been employed for each of these tasks. The findings from statistical and spatial analyses indicate presence of predominantly significant monotonic trends: precipitation and humidity tend to decrease, whereas temperature and potential evapotranspiration tend to increase with considerable spatial variability in the basin. Similarly, the drought indices exhibit predominantly humid conditions from 1979 through the end of 1990s but persistent dry conditions over the period 2000 to 2013. Out of the three methods for the estimation of potential evapotranspiration, Hargreaves and Penman–Monteith produced consistent estimations, the latter being with the highest values. Concerning the rainfall-runoff models, the goodness-of-fit results for single-event-based hydrographs indicate that GIUH-Nash model has the potential to produce acceptable values in most cases irrespective of sources and resolutions of digital elevation models, but it is found to be sensitive to the type of algorithms selected for stream network generations. The findings of the continuous simulation models suggest considerable overestimation of most of the precipitation in the reanalysis datasets, which in turn has a significant effect on other variables, such as potential evapotranspiration and thereby leading to a substantial discrepancy between simulated and observed. While there is no substitute for restoring and enhancing ground observation networks, further research that aims at identifying effective mechanisms to properly utilize reanalysis datasets are suggested.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Construction Management', 'Sustainable Development', 'Regional/Spatial Science']"

McKinsey estimates that by 2026 the commercial drones will annually impact $31 billion to $46 billion on the country’s gross domestic product. Drones have been widely adopted for data capturing that can be used in defense, agriculture, emergency response, disaster management, conservation of endangered species, healthcare, etc. For most of the applications of UAVs, Real-time object detection is exceptionally crucial. In the last few years, considering the growth of the drone industry and the interest of around 300 companies making substantial investments of time and resources in drones, many technologies have emerged for advancements in the field of UAV, focusing on object detection and recognition for UAV. This paper summarizes a number of object detection techniques proposed to date by researchers. It reports the characteristics and requirements of UAVs from an object detection viewpoint. The objective of our research is to understand different architectures that are capable of detecting objects from aerial images. The main goal of this survey is to create an insight into an architecture that is accurate, fast, robust, and utilizes low computation power.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Quality of Life Research', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Business and Management, general', 'Sustainable Development']"

Buildings, as one of the most energy-intensive sectors, have gained much attention. In 2018, the buildings and construction sector accounted for 39% of the US’s total energy consumption. Therefore, improving building energy efficiency can result in a significant effect on energy conservation. Retrofitting is a practice that can improve the energy performance of existing buildings. One of the main challenges of energy retrofit projects is selecting and prioritizing criteria, systems, and energy-retrofit measures. Numerous decision-making models have been introduced to support retrofit measure selection and combinations for a specific building. However, due to the wide variety of parameters, such as architectural, existing systems, regional, and facility operational features, the decision-making process is a complicated and dynamic problem. This study presents a literature review on energy retrofit decision-making models. We identify the most influential factors, methods used for combining conservation measures, and their implications for lifecycle cost and energy savings. In addition, recommendations for using energy retrofit decision-making models are presented. Results show that although the models’ financial criteria are considered more than social and environmental parameters, factors such as legal regulation and technical considerations should not be neglected to achieve the best possible solution.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

But no authors have yet studied whether there are differences between the use of guns in daily operations by police and the military. Nor has there been an analysis of whether the militarization of the police increases the use of firearms. Based on data on the use of guns during arrests by the police and armed forces, drawn from the National Survey of the Population Deprived of Liberty (ENPOL, 2016), in this chapter we address both questions. Through binomial logistical models we show that the use of firearms is more frequent by members of the Army and Marines than by local police, although with some significant nuances. Furthermore, several investigations have pointed to the incorporation of high-ranking military officers into the upper ranks of police organizations as an indicator of their militarization. The results of binomial logistical models show that police who are led by military officers are more inclined to use guns during arrests than those led by civilians.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Crime and Society', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Public Health']"

Our focus is on the influence of ownership, industry and support given by the organisation to the employee. Data for this study was gathered during the year of 2021 st . We have analysed data from 166 employees after roughly 15% of responses were eliminated by the control question. More than 50% of participants were mostly teleworking, around 25% mainly were working from the office, and the rest had a relatively equal combination of those two work approaches. We have found the difference between state-owned and privately-owned organisations in the perception of “telework benefits” and between different industries for the perception of “telework problems”, and both variables show different perceptions in groups with different educational support. We propose a model of the telework aversion with the factors of leaving home preference, telework anxiousness, and provided education and support by the organisation for the telework. The main limitation of our research comes from the sample size and structure. While all the model’s factors are significant, our model’s predictive power is very low, which calls for future research. Expanding regional scope and analysis on larger sample sizes can provide comparison and a basis for more advanced models predicting telework aversion.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business and Management, general', 'Data Engineering']"

The three-area system has different plants as Area-1 comprises thermal-thermal-electric vehicle (EV fleet), Area-2 comprises thermal-thermal-geothermal, and Area-3 comprises thermal-thermal-wind turbine plant (WTP). As a new attempt for the conflated system, the fuzzy-based tilt-integral-derivative (FTID) controller is being implemented as a secondary controller of ALFC systems and core controller of AVR systems. The optimum controller parameters are achieved using a bio-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm named Harris hawks optimization (HHO) technique. The system performance is evaluated using the performance index called integral square error (ISE) by having 1% perturbation at Area-1. The supremacy of the proposed FTID controller is evaluated by comparing it to the PID and TID controllers using the obtained system dynamic responses and comparing them on the subject of all time-domain indices. The impact of FTID controller in the AVR system is compared to other controllers, and the consequences of the AVR system on the ALFC system are also analyzed. By modifying the generator parameters and changing the system loading conditions, the sensitivity study of the proposed controller reveals that the optimized controller parameters determined under nominal conditions are resilient enough and do not need to be modified. Eventually, the proposed study is investigated using a real-time hardware setup, namely the OPAL-RT OP4510, for real-time corroboration.","['Engineering', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Energy Storage']"

Women in India are leaders of varied sectors of businesses and on top leadership positions except in IT companies. This study has found that 14 out of 25 leading IT companies in India has, got not more than two women on the board of directors. It has also been found that the reasons for said nomination are due to the statutory compulsion to have women on board. Information technology companies are responsible for innovation, business growth, transformation and diversification. Strategic leadership is the key for IT companies to achieve the above-stated objectives. Inclusiveness in the economic reforms is possible when women are given adequate representation in entrepreneurship Entrepreneurship and leadership positions in all sectors of industries. This study aims at examining the causes of the inadequate representation of women in Indian IT companies. Paper has examined the following issues to analyse the above-stated proposition: (a) How far the Indian IT industry has contributed to the empowerment of Indian women? (b) Whether the employment terms and recruitment policies of IT companies are sufficient to ensure the security of tenure and promotion to women employees and do it incentives women employees’ contribution towards innovation in their respective companies? (c) What are the factors contributing to women taking up leadership positions in Non-IT Industries? (d) Whether family commitments are the reasons for women in the IT sector to decline leadership positions or whether male domination is a cause for women to be backward in IT companies’ leadership positions? (e) Should mandatory reservation of adequate percentage of seats for women in administration be uniformly applied also for employment of women in the IT sector and how far the practice followed in developed jurisdictions need to be incorporated under the Indian law Law ? Enrolment of women in IT and business education is on par with their counterparts. Since women occupying leadership positions is negligible, the paper examines the challenges and proposes solutions to ensure gender equitable reforms in the leadership roles of Indian IT companies. Data related to board composition and shareholding patterns of Indian IT companies are looked into and analysed to identify whether women possess capital or management control in the Indian IT companies. To critique the role of women in other sectors of employment with that of the IT companies, data collected from the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) and Indian government-sponsored schemes are considered. The data are also collected from various sources such as Sustainability Sustainability Reports of Wipro, Infosys, HCL, Dell, Accenture, Tata, Human Development Index (HDI), United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA). The data compiled reflect the factors that affect women’s career progression in the Indian IT sector. This study has found that there is an absolute imbalance in terms of gender diversity on the boards of Indian IT companies. Reasons for the same are as follows: 1. Women who have excelled in technological education are not willing to take up leadership positions in IT companies due to the challenges and risks Risk involved in this specific sector, 2. Family commitments and health issues are not conducive for women to dedicate the required time in managing corporate boards of IT companies, 3. Joint families and a patriarchal Indian system limits woman to undertake employment, 4. Women with liberal outlook and merit are not preferred as a choice by male leaders of IT companies due to the fact that they never want to be led by women, 5. The upskilling programmes organized by IT companies to their women employees are not sufficiently focused to promote women to leadership positions and 6. Excess share qualification for directorship prescribed by listed public companies is an impediment for women to be considered for executive positions. Paper suggests strategies and policies for the promotion of women employees to executive positions and ensuring the disclosure of diversity of corporate boards as a prerequisite to listing its shares. Secondly, it proposes to amend Companies Act, 2013 to prescribe a higher number of mandatory appointments of women on board to make it mandatory for women to be part of committees of the board mandated under the Companies Act. Thirdly, it proposes that the B-Schools admission policies should increase the intake of women candidates for management programmes so that they would possess the adequate competency to govern corporate boards of Indian IT companies.","['Business and Management', 'Business and Management, general', 'Business Ethics', 'Sustainable Development', 'Corporate Governance']"

Owing to increasing environmental concerns related to global warming caused by the massive utilization of fossil resources, research efforts to reduce CO 2 emissions have increased worldwide. One of the key strategies to reduce CO 2 emissions is to change the production processes for material synthesis from chemical to biological processes. Therefore, the utilization of microorganisms is important to achieve this sustainable development goal. Many microorganisms that produce value-added chemicals have been isolated from nature. However, naturally isolated microorganisms rarely produce the target chemicals with high productivity, high yield, and final concentrations. To satisfy these parameters, metabolic engineering approaches are applied to tailor strains for the production of the target chemicals satisfying these three parameters. Besides strain performance, target chemical production from cost-effective resources is essential for practical application to compete with the production costs of chemical processes. In this chapter, we summarize the recent progress in the microbial production of three industrially important organic acids, pyruvic, lactic, and 3-hydroxy propionic acids, which have various applications in many industrial fields.","['Chemistry', 'Biochemical Engineering', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology', 'Energy Systems']"

The main risks of the model were identified, including difficulties with the sale of meat, the supply of animal feed, livestock diseases. Methods for minimizing these phenomena are proposed. On the basis of the most probable scenario, an annual financial plan for the activities of a P(F)E was developed, taking into account the indicators of its main activities, while forecast management reporting was formed, the main indicators of which are presented graphically. This approach can be used to solve management problems at the farm level, it does not require expensive software, but a qualified specialist is needed to make calculations and interpret them.","['Engineering', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Agriculture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

Recently, the occurrences of heavy downpours due to the effects of climate change have been observed all over the world, and slope failures induced by rainfall have frequently occurred accordingly. The condition of the slope during rainfall changes from moment to moment according to the infiltration of rainwater. Therefore, numerical analysis considering the interaction between ground mechanical behavior and groundwater flow is indispensable to consistently evaluate the transition from stable state to failure. This paper presents the numerical analyses of slope failures induced by rainfall using the MPM-SPH coupling method, which is suitable for large deformations and soil-water interaction problems in geotechnical engineering. First, the MPM-SPH coupling formulation for unsaturated soil is briefly described. Numerical analyses of slope failures induced by rainfall are then shown. Parametric studies about the coefficient of saturated permeability are performed to examine the effects of the hydraulic characteristics. The results indicate that the scale of slope failure and the shape of collapse are largely influenced by the hydraulic characteristics of the slope.","['Engineering', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Offshore Engineering']"

Despite being born for firm-level analyses, competitiveness is indeed commonly used at the territorial level, mainly at the regional or urban scale, normally measured with different composite structural indicators. However, since territorial competitiveness is unevenly distributed in space, territorial units smaller than a full NUTS-2 region might be differently competitive and hence suited to implement differentiated cohesion policies and smart specialisation strategies. To test the hypothesis that these firm-level indicators can characterize the intraregional differences in aggregate performance, the paper sets up a meta-analysis framework between these indicators and structural indicators (employment growth and specialisation index) measured at the NUTS-3 level. For the meta-analysis at this novel intraregional level, the paper exploits the Lombardy region as a case study. Lombardy is well suited for the aims of this paper, being a large and competitive European region, whose territory—as well as its labor market—is highly differentiated, from peripheral and mountainous areas to many medium and small cities, second-tier large cities and a large metropolitan area—the city of Milan. All these territories are characterized by different economic and social vocations, but all share the same regional administration. The results of the meta-analysis show that firm-level indicators correlate with the aggregate performance of regions and that the structural measures selected can characterize different territories in different conditions. Hence, the competitiveness of firms seems to translate into aggregate territorial performance at small spatial scales. This implies that territorial specificities are also relevant inside regions and should be considered in designing regional policy interventions, such as those of the Smart Specialisation Strategy (S3).","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'European Politics', 'Economic Growth', 'Business and Management, general', 'Economic Policy', 'Environmental Policy']"

When moving through a city in this way, we can see social imbalances, segregated spaces and neighborhoods, and changes in the landscape. Beneath what lies in plain sight lie mechanisms and regulatory apparatus. These include norms and socio-institutional structures that operate at different scales, from the local to the supranational. As we describe in this chapter, these influence urban dynamics beyond what our senses perceive directly. While we must take into account relationships between social agents, we must not overlook interactions between the agency itself and broader local, national, and international structures. Processes of capitalist globalization Globalizations , until 1970, unfolded mainly within the framework of nationally organized state States territorialities. More recently, these dynamics have changed and increased the importance of sub-national and supranational forms of territorial organization. This in turn has produced a process of rescaling and reterritorialization of capital and power. This is clearly reflected in the transfer of economic-policy authority and jurisdiction from states States to the scales mentioned above. In this chapter, we show that both state States territoriality and national governance are being redefined and deemphasized toward both wider and narrower scales. This makes up part of a neoliberal strategy to confront crises and be able to regulate capital accumulation more directly. We read the new role of local agency, as already signaled, on the basis of this diagnosis, and in a context of neoliberal rescaling. We recognize the value of forms of collective action, as well as that of the actors who, with a will toward transformation, have managed to reinvent their activity and delve into different forms of urban democratization Democratization .","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Public Policy']"

However, comparatively little is known so far about the characteristics of establishing sustainable ventures aiming at solving ecological or social problems in society. It is particularly uncertain how sustainable entrepreneurs could attain a successful upscaling of their venture ideas to expand their impact from a local niche at origin towards reaching broader society-wide impact. At this junction between local niche and the wider societal regime or landscape level, entrepreneurial ecosystems may play a key role in providing instrumental support for sustainable ventures. Entrepreneurial ecosystems offer initial support in the formation of new sustainable ventures but, also later, helping sustainable entrepreneurs in the upscaling of their sustainable venture ideas. In this chapter, we explore how entrepreneurial ecosystems could support the expansion of sustainable ventures and help overcome the barriers and dilemmas for successful sustainability upscaling. The conceptual chapter discusses selected issues in the upscaling of sustainable ventures in the ecosystem context alongside typical barriers and dilemmas in sustainability upscaling. The contribution attempted in this chapter is to build a bridge between the literature strand on upscaling within sustainable innovation and the discussion of supportive ecosystems in the field of entrepreneurship. For example, we address the composition of ecosystem stakeholders and the importance of keeping a shared sustainability orientation in the ecosystem while integrating diverse stakeholders who provide resources for the upscaling process. The discussion in this chapter is based on reviewing recent literature on the upscaling phenomenon in sustainable innovation as well as on entrepreneurial ecosystems and sustainable entrepreneurship. In particular, we suggest that upscaling in entrepreneurial ecosystems may be understood as an open-ended evolutionary process, with ecosystem networks and stakeholder collaboration providing stable spaces for reflexive discourse and learning.","['Business and Management', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Environmental Policy', 'Corporate Environmental Management', 'Environmental Management']"

They are either used as part of ingredients for meals or as major material for soup preparation. Inadequate utilization of leafy vegetables as ingredients in the industry is a way of underutilizing the vast nutrients in these leaves. However, the use of the by-products of these leafy vegetables such as the leaf powder, leaf slurry, polyphenols, proteins and peptides in improving the nutritional and bioactive properties of some food commodities such as snack , cookies, bread, fruit juice and maize ogi may help to take these vegetables out of pots to the industries .

For a multi-device multi-server MEC system, the frequently varied harvested energy, along with changeable computation task loads and time-varying computation capacities of servers, increase the system’s dynamic. Therefore, each device should learn to make coordinated actions, such as the offloading ratio, local computation capacity and server selection, to achieve a satisfactory computation quality. Thus, the MEC system with EH devices are highly dynamic and face two challenges: continuous-discrete hybrid action spaces, and coordination among devices. To deal with such problem, we propose two deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithms: hybrid decision based actor-critic learning (Hybrid-AC), and multi-device hybrid decision based actor-critic learning (MD-Hybrid-AC) for dynamic computation offloading. Hybrid-AC solves the hybrid action space with an improvement of actor-critic architecture, where the actor outputs continuous actions (offloading ratio and local computation capacity) corresponding to every server, the critic evaluates the continuous actions and outputs the discrete action of server selection. MD-Hybrid-AC adopts the framework of centralized training with decentralized execution. It learns coordinated decisions by constructing a centralized critic to output server selections, which considers the continuous action policies of all devices. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms achieve a good balance between consumed time and energy, and have a significant performance improvement compared with baseline offloading policies.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication']"

Concerning human beings, these bioactive components exhibit a wide range of health benefits upon interacting with different physiological systems. Flavonoids, tannins, anthocyanins, carotenoids, betalains, plant sterols, and glucosinolates are few examples of bioactive compounds. They are found primarily in fruits and vegetables. Multiple research studies are being conducted to verify their role in the prevention and possible reversal of cancer and cardiometabolic disorders, such as diabetes, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. Available data and research indicate their role as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant components, facilitating hormonal regulation, immune system modulation, and anticarcinogenic activities. This chapter discusses the impact of bioactive compounds on hormonal regulation in humans.

The change and adjustment of industrial chain will promote the adjustment and transformation of industrial structure. With the continuous development of technology, industry chain competition appears. The industrial chain competition not only expands the industrial chain division of labor, but also achieves the maximum governance rent. However, as COVID-19 broke out, production and logistics have stalled and regional blockades have changed the original pattern of globalization.

It is used to evaluate the exploratory behavior, general locomotor activity and emotionality of rats and mice. However, it has to be kept in mind that these behaviors are not independent; they interact and so a change in one will affect another. Despite being a seemingly simple test, several caveats need to be acknowledged when selecting the variables for analysis and interpreting the data with regard to the aforementioned domains. The observed behaviors can depend on a number of procedural, environmental, and biological factors, which should be carefully considered when planning the experiment, as well as during the analysis and interpretation of the results. This review provides a critical overview of these factors, followed by some warnings and practical tips for conducting the OFT.","['Biomedicine', 'Neurosciences']"

The optimization process is as follows: (i) the nonlinear dynamic models of aircraft were established. (ii) the tilting path of the tilt-rotor aircraft was designed by the optimal method. In order to minimize the attitude change, control energy consumption, and transition time of the aircraft during the transition process, a novel optimization cost function was built as objective for transition time, pitch angle change, and the control surface deflection minimization. The tilting strategy of the transition process was proposed based on the Gaussian pseudo spectral method. (iii) A weighted pseudo-inverse method based on niche genetic algorithm was used to design the manipulation strategy with the goal of the highest control efficiency and the smoothest transition, solving the problem of control redundancy caused by mode conversion and the lack of yaw control capability during the early stage of conversion. The simulation results show that compared to the traditional transition strategy, the novel tilting trajectory designed in this study brings better transition qualities, and the new control allocation law increases the aircraft yaw control capability, which in turn enhances the stability and anti-interference ability of the UAV in the transition mode.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

Hydrologists had been interested in the discharge and runoff caused by precipitation. This study compares two daily conceptual models, TANK and SimHyd, using the Rainfall-Runoff Library (RRL) tool and suggests which model is suitable for the Hemavathi watershed. The daily rainfall and evapotranspiration were the inputs in the TANK and SimHyd to determine daily discharge. The daily streamflow was utilized to calibrate models from 1990 to 2006 and then validated for 2007 to 2015. These model parameters are optimized using the genetic algorithm technique. Model prediction effectiveness was assessed using Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and Correlation coefficient (C C ) values. NSE and C C values during calibration was 0.71, 0.85 for TANK model, 0.66, 0.83 for SIMHYD model, and during verification was 0.64, 0.74 for TANK model, 0.62, 0.72 for SIMHYD model. From the obtained results, the TANK model performs satisfactorily in terms of NSE and C C compared to the SimHyd model.

Underdeveloped conceptual theories that fail to expose a measurement mechanism are one reason for the incommensurable measurements. Without such a mechanism measurements cannot be linked to a fundamental reference as required by metrological traceability. However, traditional metrological concepts can be extended by allowing for direct links between different instruments, so-called crosswalks. In this regard, Rasch Measurement Theory proves particularly useful as it facilitates a co-calibration of different instruments onto a common metric. The example of the measurement of nicotine dependence through self-report instruments serves as a showcase of the problems in social measurement and how they can be overcome contributing to metrological traceability in the social sciences.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Health Informatics', 'Psychometrics', 'Health Administration']"

Our architecture-design-oriented profiling method identifies program components and patterns critical to both the performance and the yield rate. A follow-up hardware design flow decomposes the complicated design procedure into three subroutines, each of which focuses on different hardware components and cooperates with corresponding profiling results and physical constraints.

Using this matrix, 15 lean supply chain management 5.0 (LSCM 5.0) principles and practices are defined in this chapter. We assert that a narrow focus on value in LSCM ought to be adjusted to reflect the broader nature of value as it is defined through the emerging industry 5.0 context. In an industry 5.0 environment, all stakeholders such as workers, managers, shareholders, and customers should be considered in decisions and valued.

This approach effectively reduces high-frequency oscillations introduced by data assimilation. However, as different scales of increments have unique evolutionary speeds and life histories in a numerical model, the traditional IAU scheme cannot fully meet the requirements of short-term forecasting for the damping of high-frequency noise and may even cause systematic drifts. Therefore, a multi-scale IAU scheme is proposed in this paper. Analysis increments were divided into different scale parts using a spatial filtering technique. For each scale increment, the optimal relaxation time in the IAU scheme was determined by the skill of the forecasting results. Finally, different scales of analysis increments were added to the model integration during their optimal relaxation time. The multi-scale IAU scheme can effectively reduce the noise and further improve the balance between large-scale and small-scale increments in the model initialization stage. To evaluate its performance, several numerical experiments were conducted to simulate the path and intensity of Typhoon Mangkhut (2018) and showed that: (1) the multi-scale IAU scheme had an obvious effect on noise control at the initial stage of data assimilation; (2) the optimal relaxation time for large-scale and small-scale increments was estimated as 6 h and 3 h, respectively; (3) the forecast performance of the multi-scale IAU scheme in the prediction of Typhoon Mangkhut (2018) was better than that of the traditional IAU scheme. The results demonstrate the superiority of the multi-scale IAU scheme. 在传统的分析增量更新 (IAU) 方案中, 所有的分析增量被当作强迫项, 在一段时间内加入模式预报方程中. 该方法能够有效地减少因资料同化而引入的高频振荡. 然而, 由于不同尺度的增量在数值模式中有各自不同的生命史和演变速度, 传统的 IAU 方法不能满足模式短临预报对于快速减少高频噪音的要求, 甚至有时候会进一步造成系统性的偏移. 因此, 本论文首次提出多尺度 IAU 方案. 通过空间滤波方法把分析增量分解成不同尺度的部分, 通过预报效果来确定不同尺度增量的最佳松弛时间. 最终, 不同尺度的分析增量在各自的最佳松弛时间中被加入到模式积分过程中. 多尺度 IAU 方案可以有效抑制模式积分过程中产生的噪音, 并进一步提高不同尺度增量在模式起始阶段的平衡. 为了评估这一方案的效果, 我们开展了几组数值试验对台风山竹的路径和强度进行模拟, 结果表明: (1) 多尺度 IAU 方案对资料同化初期所产生的噪音有明显的抑制效果; (2) 大尺度和小尺度增量的最佳松弛时间分别为 6 小时和 3 小时; (3) 多尺度 IAU 方案在台风山竹中的预报效果优于传统 IAU 方案. 这一系列模拟结果展现了多尺度 IAU 方案的优越性.","['Earth Sciences', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Meteorology', 'Geophysics/Geodesy']"

This population’s workforce Workforce happens to be one of the largest in many parts of Africa, especially when compared to others worldwide (United Nations 2016). In most African countries, the aged population group takes a significant proportion of the total population, making them crucial to the African economy. However, less attention is being paid to this growing population in terms of their current challenges, especially in the aspect of health care. Information derived from the World Health Organization shows that 28–35% of the elderly fall every year globally; leading to injuries Injuries , injury Injuries -related disabilities Disabilities , and death in the aged population (CDC 2014). This paper focuses on shedding light on the health challenges encountered by the older population in several parts of Africa and discusses how these challenges can be combated to enhance their general wellbeing. The approach used in this paper is a literature review from a variety of prestigious journals providing information about various health challenges encountered by the elderly in several countries in Africa. Some of these challenges include falls, mobility loss, vision, and cognitive impairment Impairment . From the information gathered from several literature reviews, it was discovered that the aged population would live better with the aid of technologies that are user-friendly to their specific geolocation. The use of modern technology like assistive Assistive technology and ergonomically Ergonomically designed accessories can all come in handy in serving as a source of assistance to the elderly population not just in African countries but also in several parts of the world. Given the limitations of technology in various parts of Africa, it can be concluded that more research on improving the aged population's quality of life quality using design and technology has to be further explored. This will in turn help to enhance their health and retain them in the workforce Workforce , thus, increasing the economy of Africa as a whole.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The control and limitation of toxic pollution are regulated by the norms and methods established in railway transport, which are based on instrumental methods. In addition to instrumental methods, calculation methods for determining the composition of exhaust gases, for example, equilibrium, are becoming more widespread. To solve a complex nonlinear system of equations of equilibrium, material balance and Dalton, a linearization method is proposed by taking logarithms to calculate the equilibrium composition, taking into account the nature of heat release during fuel combustion in the cylinders of a diesel locomotive engine. The values of the partial pressures of the components of the combustion products of the fuel obtained as a result of solving the system of equations make it possible to determine the mass fractions at constantly changing values of the pressure and temperature of the working heat, taking into account the characteristics of heat release throughout the process of fuel combustion in the diesel cylinder. Some results of modeling the formation of fuel combustion products for diesel locomotive 2A-5D49 of diesel locomotives TEP70BS for the nominal operating mode are presented, which confirm the possibility of using the proposed method of equilibrium composition and ways of its implementation to assess the efficiency of an autonomous locomotive both in terms of fuel efficiency and environmental safety.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

The Li-Fi is a disruptive technology driven by the visible light spectrum that makes the data transmission process much faster and enhances the system efficiency. In Li-Fi, there is no interference as in radio waves and it provides higher bandwidth. It is a bidirectional wireless data carrier medium that uses only visible light and photodiodes. Everything happens very fast in this world, including transportation. In the present scenario, spending a long time in traffic is irritating. Even after the introduction of FASTag, there is not much change in toll booth queues. It is at this point where we start to think about a different plan to avoid unwanted blocks at toll booths. Hence, we introduce the concept of Li-Fi where vehicles can move through the toll booths without any pause. All that we are using here is DRL (Daytime Running Lights). This will have a corresponding receiver section which will accept the signals from the DRL. This method also has certain extra perks which will provide an interdisciplinary help to many major fields.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Mobile and Network Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data']"

Theorizing Corporate Governance and Financial Power,OriginalPaper,"Hilferding’s work provides important theoretical foundations for a much-needed ‘Institutional Marxist’ theory of corporate governance. By tracing the evolution of state and corporate organization since the late nineteenth century, this chapter illustrates that such a theory constitutes a key basis for the periodization of capitalist development. Drawing on Hilferding’s theorization of ‘finance capital’ as a fusion of financial and industrial capital dominated by money-capital, it is suggested that the restructuring of capitalism since the 2008 crisis has led to the emergence of a ‘new finance capital.’ Through a process linking the internal restructuring of ‘non-financial’ corporations with new forms of concentration and centralization of finance across the economy, new institutional linkages between finance and industry have been consolidated, constituting a new organizational form of corporate power.

Numerical modelling of condensation with additional non-condensable gases has been a challenging task for researchers due to coupling of species transport with other fundamental governing equations. Eulerian wall film multiphase model in commercial Ansys Fluent software is used with coupling with species transport equation. Coupling is achieved by diffusion balance model which takes into account diffusion-controlled film condensation of water vapour over a plate. The model is validated on benchmarking data popularly known as CONAN experiments, wherein mixture of steam and air flow into a square cross section duct with water used as coolant. Condensation rates, heat flux and correlation based on heat and mass transfer analogy are validated using CONAN benchmarking data. In all simulations, only condensation on wall is considered and condensation in volume is neglected because of its very low contribution in film condensation. This study provides a methodology to simulate condensation in presence of non-condensable gas without use of any additional user-defined functions.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Solid Mechanics', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

From the theoretical point of view, the constitutive relations must be defined in rate form. We think that this restriction is mandatory and must be taken into account. On another hand, to predict eventual instabilities, the finite strain range is a priori assumed within the formulation where the kinematics must be adapted in adequacy. Here use is made of a multiplicative decomposition of the actual deformation gradient into its known intermediate part at an earlier time and the relative deformation gradient with respect to the configuration at that time. The incremental constitutive relations and evolution equations can then be ideally defined on the above intermediate configuration prior to be transported back to the reference configuration within a Lagrangian formulation. The early age creep is here introduced through an internal variable approach that is motivated by the generalized Maxwell model. A set of finite element simulations is performed to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed framework. In particular, a slump-test-like example is given where a method can be highlighted to help identifying, in future works, the material parameters relative to the early-age creep.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Structural Materials', 'Sustainable Development', 'Mathematical Modeling and Industrial Mathematics']"

During usage, brake rotors are gradually worn off and periodically replaced. Currently, replaced brake rotors are mostly remelted to produce brand-new cast iron products, resulting in a relatively high energy consumption and carbon footprint into the environment. In addition, automotive brakes emit airborne particles. Some of the emitted particles are categorized as ultrafine, which are sized below 100 nm, leading to a series of health and environmental impacts. In this study, two surface treatment techniques are applied, i.e., high-velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) and laser cladding (LC), to overlay wear-resistant coatings on conventional GCI brake rotors in order to refurbish the replaced GCI brake rotor and to avoid the remelting procedure. The two coating materials are evaluated in terms of their coefficient of friction (CoF), wear, and ultrafine particle emissions, by comparing them with a typical GCI brake rotor. The results show that the CoF of the HVOF disc is higher than those of the GCI and LC discs. Meanwhile, HVOF disc has the lowest wear rate but results in the highest wear rate on the mating brake pad material. The LC disc yields a similar wear rate as the GCI disc. The ultrafine particles from the GCI and LC discs appeared primarily in round, chunky, and flake shapes. The HVOF disc emits unique needle-shaped particles. In the ultrafine particle range, the GCI and HVOF discs generate particles that are primarily below 100 nm in the running-in period and 200 nm in the steady state. Meanwhile, the LC disc emitted particles that are primarily ∼200 nm in the entire test run.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

A specific T cell subset present in peripheral blood of human subjects and mouse models called Th40, CD4 + helper T cells that express the CD40 receptor, are emerging as diagnostic in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Th40 cell number expansions predate symptoms in both T1DM and MS in human subjects. Th40 cells prove pathogenicity by transferring T1DM in the diabetes preclinical mouse model and transferring severe symptoms in the MS mouse model. Th40 cells undergo a process called TCR revision, altering TCR expression in the periphery, constituting a mechanism that increases immune diversity to invaders like viruses, but also may increase the existence of self-antigen reactive T cells. Th40 cells are indicative of systemic inflammation and in combination with other markers, HLA and chemokine receptor expressions, can be diagnostic for specific autoimmune diseases.","['Biomedicine', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Pharmacology/Toxicology']"

The pathogenesis of ASD is multifactorial, including deterioration of preexisting adolescent deformity during adulthood, progressive degenerative disease of the spine, post-traumatic, and iatrogenic. Additionally, a number of environmental and behavioral factors contribute to the formation and progression of ASD. Spinopelvic parameters including pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, sacral slope, coronal Cobb angles, and sagittal vertical axis help clinicians identify and classify different types of spinal deformity. Due to the complex nature of these pathologies, and the frequently extensive surgeries required to remedy them, the risk of blood loss, neurologic decline, and other complications intraoperatively and postoperatively are high. The use of multimodal intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring (IONM) as an adjunct to adult spinal deformity correction can help avoid neurologic complications. The most commonly utilized modalities include somatosensory-evoked potentials, motor-evoked potentials, and electromyography. Somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEPs) allow for continuous assessment of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord and are therefore most useful during procedures with a posterior approach to the cervical and thoracic spine. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and electromyography (EMG) can be applied intermittently to assess motor nerve function. The utility of each individual modality can be largely dependent on surgical approach; however, frequent communication with the neurophysiologist and anesthesiologist is paramount in ensuring accurate and useful measurements can be made. Intraoperative protocols can help simplify and streamline the process of neurophysiologic testing around planned approaches and corrective maneuvers, as well as aid in maintaining prompt and accurate interpretation and response to changes in neurophysiologic signals. The efficacy of intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring is dependent on prompt and accurate recognition of changes in signals. This is then followed by accurate recognition of the cause for these changes and appropriate responses by the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and monitoring personnel to correct the change.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Anesthesiology', 'Neurosurgery', 'Pain Medicine']"

When compared to traditional testing methods, the approach is very efficient and reliable, if important surrounding effects can be included in a virtual model (simulation model) which is interacting with the physical component (physical model). The virtual model must be processed in real time, and proper coupling is essential for reliable and consistent test results. Consequently, the physical interface conditions must be satisfied, and therefore, a transfer system is generally required for component testing. In the work presented, a real-time hybrid simulation experiment is used to study the influence of a Duffing absorber on the dynamics of the fundamental mode of vibration of a nonlinear host structure. Only standard hardware components are used, e.g., electrodynamic shaker, force, displacement and acceleration sensors, as well as a real-time processing unit. The study is currently limited to periodic forcing, and consequently, only the steady-state response is studied. Since the physical absorber investigated behaves nonlinear elastic, all measurements can be collected sequentially to generate high-precision force response diagrams for different amplitudes and frequencies. So far, the experimental results agree well with theoretical predictions and confirm that nonlinear dynamic absorbers are particularly suited to mitigate vibrations of nonlinear host structures. As the properties of the nonlinear absorber are adjustable, existing design rules can be verified by the proposed experimental setup.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Civil Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

This trend is impelled by both the public and private sectors, whose activities have different aims and purposes. Both multilateral and bilateral donors, including Japan, have planned and implemented various development projects in collaboration with untraditional partners, such as corporations. This chapter examines how partnerships with the private sector have been formed, focusing on Japan. First, it briefly studies international initiatives to understand the process by which previously separated entities—public and private sectors—gradually move closer to solve development problems. It then explores the way the Government of Japan and the Japan International Cooperation Agency Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) , who are responsible for the public sector Public sector , have come to create or support projects in collaboration with companies. Their shift in the direction of international development responds to international calls for sustainable development.

Adaptive PENSE is designed to give reliable results under two common challenges often encountered in these kinds of studies: (1) the number of samples with known clinical outcome and proteomic data is small, while the number of candidate proteins is large and/or (2) proteomic data and the clinical outcome measurements suffer from data quality issues in a small fraction of samples. Even in the presence of these challenges, adaptive PENSE reliably identifies proteins relevant for prediction and estimates accurate predictive models. Adaptive PENSE is designed to be resilient to data quality issues in up to 50% of samples. Almost half of the samples could have aberrant values in the measured protein levels and clinical outcome values without causing severe detrimental effects to the estimated predictive model. The method is implemented as an R package and supports the user in the model selection process by automating most steps and providing diagnostic visualizations to guide the user. Users can choose among several predictive models to select the model with high prediction accuracy and an appropriate number of selected proteins.","['Life Sciences', 'Biostatistics', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general', 'Bioinformatics']"

This article provides a study of the process of washing the working surfaces of metallic and non-metallic friction elements at the micro level. The obtained equations of motion, energy balance and diffusion of the boundary layer of the air flow near the working surfaces make it possible to evaluate the criteria that affect the process of air change in the boundary layer. Its thickness is proposed as the defining criteria for assessing the boundary layer of an air flow near friction pairs. When considering the air flow as homogeneous, the determining criterion is the thickness of the dynamic boundary layer. If in the boundary layer chemical processes occurring during the interaction of working surfaces with an air flow are taken into account, then the criteria for assessing the energy and diffusion state are the thicknesses of the thermal and diffusion boundary layers. Depending on the composition and concentration of components in the boundary layer of the air flow, the ratio of its various thicknesses can be estimated. The obtained dependences make it possible to determine the nature of formation and possible methods of counteracting the insulating nature of the boundary layer. This will further make it possible to increase the heat removal from the heated surfaces of the friction elements at the micro level.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

The CNN extracts user emotion from a favorite playlist and extracts audio features from the songs and metadata. The output of the user emotion and audio features is combined, and a collaborative filtering method is used to select the best song for recommendation.

From only a handful of economies in North America and Europe, the adoption of competition law and policy has spread rapidly to Asian economies since 1990. Like their Western counterparts several decades earlier, most Asian jurisdictions have exempted agriculture, albeit in varying degrees, from the prohibitions of competition law, such as those involving the exercise of market power by farmers’ associations. Public choice considerations suggest that the exemption serves as a countervailing force for the farmers’ comparatively weak position in the balance of political influence for agricultural policy and in bargaining power over the more concentrated wholesale-retail segments of the agri-food value chain. Farm heterogeneity and farm-operation consolidation, induced in part by the economy’s structural transformation, weaken the case for broad exemption.","['Economics', 'Agricultural Economics', 'Development Economics', 'Development Studies', 'Agriculture']"

The history of blast disease, which affects one of the world’s staple foods, rice, goes back centuries and has been a continual problem for rice production worldwide with the recent inclusion of wheat blast. Extensive studies on the biology, pathogenicity, and population genetics of Maganaporthe oryzae (Synonym: Pyricularia oryzae ), the causal agent of blast disease, have enriched our understanding of the potential threat that this pathogen poses to rice and wheat production, and therefore world food security. Based on host specificity, mating ability, and genetic relatedness, M. oryzae is divided into several subgroups or pathotypes (different crop-adapted lineages). The genome structure of M. oryzae , characterized by instability, parasexual recombination, and the presence of transposon elements, enabling this pathogen to evolve rapidly and jump from one host to another, has raised real concerns for scientists, growers, and food policy makers. All available options such as forecasting and mapping of disease and pathogen race distribution, early and reliable quick diagnostics, biological and chemical control measures, inclusion of cultivars with resistance genes, and development of blast-resistant variety using CRISPR-Cas genome editing should be considered and deployed as a package for successful control of M. oryzae .","['Life Sciences', 'Microbiology', 'Plant Pathology', 'Microbial Genetics and Genomics', 'Plant Physiology', 'Mycology', 'Plant Sciences']"

This increased concern for environmental awareness has revived the inclination to develop renewable energy power generation strategies and to utilize potential present in electric vehicles. The issues present in renewable energy power generation: intermittent nature, distributed generation, lack of effective energy storage system is a concern. Similarly, electric vehicles which are predicted as the major player in upcoming vehicle market sales need an effective charging network to support their energy demand. For the present traditional grid to meet the electric vehicle’s energy demand and to sustain synchronization during peak demands can be a challenge. Are there possibilities that these two problems, have one common solution? Microgrids can be the answer. But how? With this intent, the present review covers the opportunities, challenges, and latest applied energy management strategies for a renewable energy integrated microgrid assisted with electric vehicles.","['Energy', 'Energy Systems', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation']"

A dynamic environment during the outbreak of COVID-19 significantly impacted on the resilience of the ecotourism industry. As a result, the focus of this paper is on identifying the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats associated with existing ecotourism destinations in Malaysia, on examining available mechanisms for developing, enhancing, and marketing this product globally, on identifying the initiatives that can be implemented to attract both domestic and also international tourist segments, and on making strategic recommendations. Additionally, this article established an empirical model to ensure the sustainability of ecotourism, which will be capable of verifying Malaysia’s attractiveness as an ecotourism destination in the region. This integrated model will synchronise the relationships between the attractiveness of ecotourism product attributes as a multi-cultural tourism destination (supply) and the behavioural intentions of tourists seeking ecotourism experience (demand) in Malaysia. These attributes have been investigated because it’s not only as supply-side qualifying factors, but also as indicators of prospective tourists’ perceived value. According to current trends in demand for ecotourism, Malaysia is undoubtedly facing stiff global competition and is well positioned to become the region's preferred destination for ecotourism. Additional information is required to comprehend segments of the ecotourism market, as there is tremendous potential for growth both locally and globally.","['Business and Management', 'Tourism Management', 'Business and Management, general', 'Asian Business', 'Management', 'Industries', 'Marketing']"

The authors of the article carried out an empirical verification of the hypothesis, which suggests that within the same administrative region, the agglomeration territory is characterized by better dynamics of the economic space compared to the peripheral territory. The objects of study were the third largest in Russia Samara-Togliatti agglomeration with a polycentric spatial structure and the territory outside the agglomeration (far periphery) of the Samara region. The author's method of comparative analysis included, among others, the stage of selecting groups of indicators that characterize the economic space of the compared territories and, at the same time, are provided with official Russian statistics. The results of the study were quite unexpected: they showed that for the agglomeration, the dynamics in the group of indicators “saturation of the economic space with the activities of economic agents” is worse compared to the periphery. The reasons for this, according to the authors, could be the “deagglomeration” effect, as well as the phenomenon of “immunity of peripheral territories”, which prevents the decrease in their viability and resilience.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Data Engineering']"

Ovarian cancer offers a significant number of metabolic dysregulation profiling opportunities, which aids drug discovery and development. Despite the reality that extensive studies have been undertaken on the area, the connection between body weight and ovarian cancer remains uncertain. Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) are a useful tool in this situation because they represent the metabolic framework of cells and provide a practical platform for simulating and measuring metabolic fluxes in human beings using constraint-based mathematical methodologies. The model obtained can be utilized for understanding cell metabolism. The dataset GSE130350 was utilized to evaluate and create a model to comprehend their reactions and metabolites. The flux score was calculated by the Recon3D-based metabolic model using MATLAB’s COBRA toolbox and Python’s COBRApy, and data analysis was done. The resulting model consists of 10,610 reactions and 5837 metabolites with a flux score of 1.72. Absolute quantitative gene expression data have been defined to predict genome-scale flux patterns. RNA sequencing methods like single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) method and bulk RNA-seq method were used for understanding gene expression. scRNA-seq was designed to exhibit distinct cell behavior in relation to its environs; bulk RNA-seq, on the contrary, was never meant to characterize a cancer formation precisely.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Artificial Intelligence']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-19467-2_5,en,"Reinventing Marine Exploitaition—New Mariculture, Energy and Marine Products Approach",OriginalPaper,"It is difficult to make a synthesis of the new trends in the so-called Blue Growth. This chapter opens a small window with some examples that can serve to understand a little bit the trends of some (not all) sectors that are in full expansion all over the world simultaneously, with their pros and cons. There is a need to change the rules of the game, the paradigms to which we have so far been working with. It is not a simple exercise. It needs a lot of will and a deep understanding of what are the limits and dangers of the old model in which we still live immersed. Many examples show that the actual model runs too fast and has a direct impact on natural resources and ecosystem functioning. In this framework, aquaculture is coming under specific scrutiny. We have gone from an almost negligible aquaculture figure in the ‘70s in terms of fisheries production, to almost half of the biomass extracted from the sea and continental waters from this “farming” activity. This is a considerable achievement, but it has its consequences. The impact of monocultures (salmon, shrimp, etc.) has been, in many places, equal to or worse than overfishing. Eutrophication, salinization, introduction of drugs to contain diseases, the use of wild fish to feed mariculture species or the systematic hunting of potential predators (eagles, seals, etc.) are only some of the problems associated with aquaculture nowadays. The impact on wild ecosystems such as mangroves or fjords is very relevant, and has been highlighted as one of the most important problems to be solved in coastal waters. A new vision is that of the Integrated Multitrophic Aquaculture. This is a method that is gaining strength and that may be the change we need, especially if we move from species of high energy and carbon investment (carnivores) to those species that require less energetic effort (such as bivalves, macroalgae, holothurians, etc.). To do this, one of the first things to do is a good forecast of the impact of climate change, selecting the most suitable organisms (and areas) according to the changing environmental conditions. The regional possibilities (i.e., those areas that may be suitable for a mariculture expansion) and the carrying capacity of the surrounding ecosystems according to different areas must also be taken into account if we want a significant paradigm change. Also, the inclusion of stakeholders and clear co-governance roles of these kind of infrastructures has to be understood as a tool to a successful management of the products that will be available for the local people. The Blue Growth related to the mariculture is not the only open front for the future. The use of microalgae is another type of approach to a future in which low-energy cost organisms are gradually taking center stage. The possibilities have a wide spectrum, and now these microorganisms are beginning to be applied industrially in nutraceuticals, biofuels or for the generation of interesting molecules for biomedical applications. The solutions are there, and changing the priorities and the way we apply the different discoveries to be in line with SDG14 in this Blue Growth strategy is a challenge. In fact, it is not all positive prospects in Blue Growth. There are cases in which excessive acceleration of production and inadequate management of “new generation” resources can cause stress on systems, especially in places with fragile ecosystem balances. In addition, considering the production of alternative energies such as offshore wind, or the new planning of maritime traffic, we have to deeply change our way to proceed. The Blue Growth roadmap must change the paradigm if we really want to consider it sustainable. New solutions and new perspectives in a changing world that require spatial planning and a very different model of resource management than the one we are now applying are urgently needed, considering new models of production, economy and social interaction.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"

This study contributes to developing a method for reducing the burden of gas cylinder delivery. LP gas cylinders are manually transported, and the physical burden on delivery personnel is high. Existing methods to minimize this burden include cart transportation. In the delivery environment, narrow spaces and steps exist, increasing the difficulty of cart transportation. Therefore, we propose a support device as a new method for reducing this burden. The support device was designed based on a survey of the LP gas cylinder delivery environment and a method for holding cylinders. The support device enhanced walking and was less physically demanding. The subjective evaluation showed that it exhibits the characteristics of the main method used for holding cylinders while improving the shortcomings. This device significantly reduces the load on the upper body during delivery.","['Engineering', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Robotics', 'Computational Intelligence']"

As the complexity of data has increased due to higher dimensions, diverse approaches have been successfully tested for nearest neighbor queries, clustering algorithms, etc. These algorithms have been optimized and adapted for CPU, GPU and hybrid models as combination of CPU and GPU. Closest pair (CP) computation is a frequently used operation in range and distance-based queries. Although there are different algorithms and optimizations available for CP computations, suitability of GPU for this operation is yet to be explored. Hereby in this paper we propose CPU-GPU Hybrid Model, to optimize the closest pair (CP) of points problem concerning two-dimensional floating point values. As part of the combined model, the sorting phase is implemented on CPU and computation of closest pair is implemented on GPU. In this work, three CP algorithms are analyzed on CPU and CPU-GPU combinations. With the proposed algorithm on the CPU-GPU combined model, up to 12 times speedup is achieved in the closest pair computation time. Several parameters were tuned to work with the device-specific features and the overhead in terms of data transfer is also analyzed.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Statistics, general', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Sociology, general', 'Professional Computing']"

Supported by the literature, we argue that corporate sustainability is often weak sustainability, where sustainability issues are sought to be integrated into business rather than positioning business within sustainability. Drawing on a research-based understanding of sustainability, we propose the following definition of sustainable business: A business is sustainable when it, in aggregate, contributes to securing the social foundations for humanity, now and for the future, within planetary boundaries. We then focus on the role of interdisciplinarity for sustainable business research. We present the Daughters of Themis Network and its call for papers, which focused on moving beyond the widely accepted acknowledgement of the need for interdisciplinarity and instead explored how interdisciplinarity can be brought into effect. We briefly present the contributions in this volume, organised in three parts: Reflections, Theory, and Practice. The chapters present the depth and variety of interdisciplinary business research. We conclude with a call for strong interdisciplinarity in sustainable business research to overcome the limitations of our disciplines and to work towards the development of new methodologies and new knowledge to further sustainable business.","['Business and Management', 'Sustainability Management', 'Economic Geography', 'Diversity Management/Women in Business', 'Law and Economics', 'Business Ethics']"

Apparently, social medias are found convenient, effective, and less expensive to market political agendas and to reach out voters easily. Particularly, they are ideal to attract young voters who have low interest in politics because of ease of generating contents, commenting and reflecting on posts, ease of sharing contents to large audience breaking down barriers to freedom of expression. Data for the study were gathered through domain expert involved focus group discussion (FGD). Thematic analysis approach was used to generate themes and insights from the data. The study reveals interesting results on two key relevant issues: media law and individual rights. From the perspectives of media law and policy, the study uncovered paucity and loopholes connected to nurturing a culture of constructive critique on political matters, the need to have sound communication policy at all key governmental institutions, weak regulatory system in terms of crafting and enforcing relevant media laws, the tendency of demeaning accountability on the side of social media companies and social media users, the need to explore legal and diplomatic pressures on social media companies to discharge their corporate social responsibilities by protecting the platform they have developed not to be used to incite conflict, violence, and human right abuses. With regard to upholding fundamental human rights, social medias have provided great opportunities to the general public to easily air out their views and promote political agendas they support. Social medias also paved the way to realize freedom of speech, which presupposes orderly liberty that do not grant a license to threaten individual’s existential rights opening the door for gross human right violations.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The prevailing gaps between the numbers of female candidates and the actual numbers of women elected from the party lists, in a highly competitive electoral process, also reveals a precarious context for women’s nomination due to stagnant and sexist institutional settings and gendered recruitment dynamics. Ideological differences among the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) which implements a soft quota, the social democratic Republican People’s Party (CHP) which adopted a formalized party quota, and the left-wing Kurdish-nationalist People’s Democracy Party (HDP) which has recently adopted a parity objective, partially account for differences in quota implementation. The chapter also underlines inter-party differences in terms of the gendered formal and informal institutional dynamics during candidate selection, which places the HDP ahead of others in terms of nominating and electing more women. In contrast, the more fluid context of a nomination process controlled by male-dominated leadership and party selectors, absent or weakly endorsed quota rules and sanctions, and the conventional status of the women’s branches, continue to hamper effective implementation within the AKP and the CHP.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Politics and Gender', 'Gender Studies', 'Comparative Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Public Administration']"

Decision-making was centered around the Prime Minister’s Office and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, and horizontal coordination created challenges. The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare was highly visible throughout the crisis, but occasionally the views of the health authorities and the government differed. After an initial seemingly passive phase, the government in mid-March 2020 declared a state of emergency and imposed strict anti-pandemic measures. The first wave of the pandemic was characterized by a sense of national urgency both in terms of policies and public opinion. Subsequently the government shifted to a decentralized, hybrid strategy under normal legislation, with targeted regional solutions favoured more instead of nation-wide measures. This produced occasional tensions between subnational authorities and the national executive while the confusing terminology of the authorities contributed to the increasing criticism of the government. However, overall, there was very little contestation of the adopted measures.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Comparative Politics']"

CMOS mm-wave power amplifiers above 100 GHz have a fairly low-peak PAE Power added efficiency (PAE) with a further large reduction operating at back-off due to the class-A operation. The use of higher-order modulation schemes will thus result in low-efficiency transmission. The improvement of PA efficiency at power back-off has been the focus of a lot of research in the past. All these known techniques are not always applicable due to either the high required absolute bandwidth or limitation due the high operating frequency. In this chapter, some common efficiency enhancement techniques are discussed that can be applicable for future 6G mm-wave PAs. A simple technique is chosen and demonstrated in a design example of a 16 nm FinFET D-band PA with efficiency enhancement and adjustable amplitude and phase linearization. The PA is combined with a direct-conversion modulator to form a functional D-band transmitter demonstrating up to 44 Gbps transmission.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Microwaves, RF and Optical Engineering', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation']"

Humidity in the indoor environment can cause the growth of mold and the spread of bacteria, when in turn lead to health problems, such as respiratory diseases, asthma, allergies, fatigue, and headaches. Therefore, waste is effectively used as a building material for indoor humidity control. This will benefit the health of indoor occupants. In this study, discarded eggshells were selected as the research and development of indoor humidity control building materials, and were analyzed and compared with two natural humidity control coatings on the market. They were classified into three types as A-CO, B-SI and C-ES, and their humidity control capabilities are: (A) The moisture absorption capacity of A-CO is 74.77 g/m 2 , and the moisture release capacity is 72.48 g/m 2 . (B) The moisture absorption capacity of B-SI is 61.47 g/m 2 , and the moisture release capacity is 51.92 g/m 2 . (C) The moisture absorption capacity of C-ES is 100 g/m 2 , and the moisture release capacity is 91.8 g/m 2 . According to this result, the order of moisture absorption and dehumidification performance is C-ES > A-CO > B-SI; the overall performance ranking is C-ES > A-CO > B-SI. Through the equilibrium moisture content experiment of the developed building material (C-ES), we know that, on average, each 20 cm * 20 cm sample can absorb 4.05 g of water and release 3.66 g of water.

Class imbalance affects the learning process negatively, resulting in classification algorithms’ ignorance of the minority class. To address this issue, various researchers developed different algorithms to tackle the problem; however, the majority of these algorithms are complex and generate noise. This paper provides a simple and effective oversampling technique based on the mean-shift clustering algorithm and using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) of selected clusters. We conducted several experiments to compare the performance of our technique with different algorithms mentioned in the literature on three common datasets. Experimental results indicate that our technique performs better in synthesizing new samples and improves support vector machine (SVM) classification performance on imbalanced datasets.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

Not only does this improve occupant comfort, but also increases energy sustainability Energy sustainability . Recently, advanced materials Advanced materials have been utilized for developing large-scale building skins with intelligent functionalities. Many current challenges focus on improving environmental safety, increasing energy efficiency, and reducing our carbon footprint. Advanced materials Advanced materials have played key roles in addressing these critical issues through fascinating properties that are ideal for building skin engineering. In this chapter, a series of bio-inspired green nano hybrids are introduced for solar harvesting, energy generation, and photothermally-activated building heating. These nano biohybrids Nanobiohybrids can be physically retrofitted into existing residential buildings and structures, independently providing self-sustainable green energy. This chapter explores the most recent developments of nanostructure-based building skins that are smart, intelligent, adaptive, responsive and biologically inspired for energy and environmental sustainability. More specifically, we have developed smart building façades utilizing nanomaterial assemblies that have the ability to regulate and control energy consumption and generation, leading to energy neutral civic infrastructure. Novel nanostructures are designed, synthesized, and developed capable of the most efficient solar harvesting and energy generation. Fundamental studies have been carried out to identify operating mechanisms dictating the optical, thermal, and electrical properties of the thin films on building skins for required functions. Lab-scale modules can be designed to test the performance of multifunctional thin films in terms of solar harvesting, visible transmittance, photovoltaic Photovoltaic (PV) and photothermal Photothermal (PT) efficiencies. The novel concepts include Optical Thermal Insulation (OTI) without any intervention medium typically used in glazing technologies, and building skins with PV-PT dual modalities that can be seasonably altered for energy efficiency and generating solar-mediated thermal energy for building heating utilities. OTI is established by solar heating of a photothermal coating on a window surface. by reducing the temperature difference between the window surface and room interior, the heat loss through a single pane is lowered without the air gap of the double pane. A transparent building skin can be engineered as a PV and PT device in the same surface coating with a dual modality. While the solar energy harvested can be converted to electricity via PV in the summer, the same film is photonically-activated to generate heat in the winter for reduced heat loss. The PV-PT dual-modality device can be applied as a smart building skin Smart building skin upon a large surface area for enhanced solar harvesting and alternative energy generation such as electrical and thermal energy. The solar light can also be wave-guided through transparent photo-thermal panels for generating high heat for building utilities.

Thus, data from a similar source structure can be used to train a classifier that generalises to a target structure. Conventional unsupervised domain adaptation methods would assume that the data available from both structures belongs to the same number of damage-states or disparate environmental conditions; however, in practical scenarios, the data in the target structure may pertain to a subset of the available classes in the source structure; this is a partial domain adaptation problem. Conventional domain adaptation methods are prone to performance degradation in this scenario. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel statistic alignment method and instance-weighting strategy. A numerical population of structures demonstrates that these methods facilitate transfer where a number of state-of-the-art domain adaptation algorithms cannot.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

The transient emission (WHTC) characteristics of three-way catalyst (TWC) on the engine rig are studied based on the design enhancements aforementioned above, along with the precious group metals (PGMs) loadings and specific PGM ratios. However, the catalyst with higher PGM loading and specific PGM ratio supported significantly to light-off swiftly for the TWC after-treatment system as well as for reduction of peak emissions. Though, in this study, NO x and CH 4 emissions are considered as the key emissions, and the air–fuel ratio parameters are optimized accordingly. Furthermore, for the selected PGM concentration, the NH 3 emission is observed to increase in cold-start cycle, due to steam reforming reactions over the TWC system, and the catalyst effectiveness is recognized in hot-start cycle with NH 3 reduction. Nevertheless, in the TWC formulation, the Pd is indispensable to meet the emission regulation limit. However, to minimize the cost for TWC as well as to maintain higher emission conversion margin, bringing down the Rh content as well as enhancing the Pt/Pd ratio could be a viable solution. A right balance between the cost and performance of TWC is provided as the scientific reference in this paper.

To meet India’s NDC ambitions, the federal government announced determined targets to integrate 450 GW Renewable Energy in the grid by 2030. This paper explores the pathways to integrate high RE generation by 2030 with effective balancing of supply and demand and associated challenges of flexibility requirements. A Unit commitment and economic dispatch model, which simulates the power system operation was used. The overall share of variable renewables reaches 26% and 32% in the Baseline Capacity Scenario (BCS) and High Renewable Energy Scenario (HRES) respectively. Improved ramp rates and a minimum thermal loading limit induce flexibility in the thermal fleet. In the HRES, more than 16 GW of coal plants are required for two-shift operations in April and more than 50% of days see an aggregate all-India ramp from the coal fleet in excess of 500 MW per minute. Battery Storage provides daily balancing while reducing VRE curtailment to less than 0.2% in the HRES. Nationally Coordinated dispatch shows increased power transfer from high VRE regions to export power during high VRE generation periods. It is thus found that high RE penetration is possible by 2030 at no extra system costs.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Natural Resource and Energy Economics', 'African Politics', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'International Relations']"

Many states have adopted or are in the process of adopting data protection laws based on principles similar to those of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union, resulting in a global convergence of data protection rules. Yet doubts may arise regarding the ability of the GDPR to effectively safeguard data protection principles and rights in the age of big data and related algorithmic decision-making. Against this background, the choice of the risk-based approach as the key law enforcement mode under the GDPR might be interpreted to be a result of the recognition of a law/technology lag in this instance, in the sense of an intrinsic difficulty of the law in dealing with the pervasiveness and automation involved in present-day collection, circulation and use of the data. The risk-based approach leaves data protection decisions mainly to the data controllers. A better explanation for the GDPR’s novel enforcement mode may be found in the “law as technology” proposition, meaning a law intended to liberate the use of digital technologies. In the context of its strategy for a data-driven economy, the EU had shown its concern with European lateness in embracing the data revolution. Accordingly, EU data protection reform has been meant to reduce the administrative burden on the data controllers and processors so as to further the competitiveness of the digital single market. As a consequence, data protection will ultimately depend on how the data controllers will meet their greater responsibilities.","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy of Technology', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'History of Technology']"

The present chapter frames the main debates, advances, and challenges. It is situated within both the implementation turn of research on gender equality policies and the broader implementation focus in political research. By way of introduction, the chapter addresses how gender quotas impact the number of women in political representation. It briefly discusses the main focus and findings of the literature on gender quotas to then articulate how the volume will expand upon these themes. The second section provides an overview of how our contributors address the implementation of gender quotas within the different countries covered. Based on the Gender Equality Policy in Practice (GEPP) approach, the chapters in the volume assess how quotas are put into practice, with which instruments, who drives implementation, and how they are negotiated, supported, contested, or resisted. We pay particular attention to how cultural, institutional, and political factors impact implementation. While the individual country chapters unravel the findings in detail, the third section homes in on how such factors intersect to facilitate or block adequate deployment of instruments. We also ask what helps or hinders the creation of inclusive policy environments that empower those in charge of and/or those who mobilize for quota implementation. The conclusion summarizes the main comparative findings on what makes quotas stick and what renders this secret garden of politics more transparent and accessible.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Politics and Gender', 'Gender Studies', 'Comparative Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Public Administration']"

Typically, these exotic interactions are mediated by ultralight bosons with very weak coupling strength. If they indeed exist, such long-range interactions would indicate new physics beyond the Standard Model. A wide variety of experimental tests have been made to search for novel long-range spin-dependent interactions. Most experimental searches have focused on monopole-dipole or dipole-dipole interactions that could be induced by the exchange of ultralight bosons such as axions or axionlike particles. These ultralight bosons could also provide an answer to some of the most challenging problems in modern particle physics and astronomy: for example, the strong- CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), where C represents the charge conjugate symmetry and P represents the parity symmetry, and the explanation of dark matter and dark energy. In this chapter, we discuss the theoretical motivations as well as experimental searches for exotic spin-dependent interactions mediated by ultralight bosons in recent decades. We also introduce ongoing experimental efforts, such as Axion Resonant InterAction DetectioN Experiment (ARIADNE) and the QUest for AXion (QUAX)- g s g p experiment. The high sensitivities of these tests will allow vast expansion of the discovery potential for exotic spin-dependent interactions.","['Physics', 'Particle and Nuclear Physics', 'Astrophysics and Astroparticles', 'Cosmology']"

To keep the quantities of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at a safe level, air pollution must be reduced. Many studies have reported techniques for converting the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, into viable fuels as a method of reducing air pollution. The trending topic of photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 to fuels has shown high potential. This process is environment-friendly due to its capability to be performed at ambient temperature and pressure and hence utilize less energy. This review focuses on the thermodynamic and reaction kinetics of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Various types of photocatalysts used for CO 2 reduction are discussed excessively by considering metallic, non-metallic, and composite systems.

Analysis of the sectional capacity in the case of non-square or irregular sections is very complex and takes time. This paper offers a cross-sectional analysis with a numerical approach that is implemented in a computer program. Several cross-sectional forms from the results of previous studies were adopted for validation purposes. The selection of the cross-section considers the representation of the cross-section shape and the configuration of the reinforcement. In addition to the cross-sectional shape, the method of analysis is also a consideration for selection. From the results of the analysis using numerical methods and comparison of the analysis of previous researchers, it shows a fairly good level of accuracy with an average deviation of 2.35%. The largest deviation was in Section 7 and 8 with a deviation of 5.03 and 8.62%, respectively. This deviation is more due to the analysis method. Analysis using finite element method for sections, 9 and 10 show slightly higher than the numerical method due to neglecting tensile strength of concrete and strain hardening of steel on the numerical method. On the other side, the analysis with the cross-section conversion approach shows lower results.

In 2015, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlighted that the Earth’s climate system has consistently been warming since the 1950s and that a “large fraction of anthropogenic climate change resulting from CO 2 emissions is irreversible on a multi-century to millennial time scale, except in the case of a large net removal of CO 2 from the atmosphere over a sustained period”. Initial responses to climate change revolved around States attempting to reduce, rather than remove, greenhouse gas emissions. However, as the global economy expands, greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise and cooperative arrangements aimed at reducing emissions have had limited, if any, impact. If recent predictions are to be believed, the remaining “carbon budget” needed to prevent average global temperatures from increasing by more than 1.5 °C may be exhausted by 2030. Climate Analytics estimates that the current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) made by States under the Paris Agreement indicate that average global temperatures will rise by 2.8 °C by 2100—almost double the stipulated efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels mentioned in Article 2(1)(a) of the Paris Agreement. The recent IPCC Special Report on 1.5 °C Global Warming concludes that without “increased and urgent mitigation ambition in the coming years, leading to a sharp decline in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, global warming will [cause] irreversible loss of the most fragile ecosystems and crisis after crisis for the most vulnerable people and societies”.","['Law', 'International Environmental Law', 'Environmental Economics']"

The theory and empirical application of soft power ‎have emerged as a peaceful tool where a state can use its intangible resources attractively and ‎harmoniously to ensure its national interests. Many considerable indicators suggest that China ‎and India have capacities and resources that can be a foremost case for understanding soft ‎power discourse. As a regional, historical, and strategic neighbor of China and India, Iran ‎has so many shared relations with each other. The question, however, of whether and how China ‎and India can cooperate and engage comparatively is at the core of international affairs as to the ‎case of Iran, especially after the American withdrawal from Afghanistan, how China and ‎India will activate their new openings in the post-American world order in the region. ‎Building on existing literature, this book argues that, in its unique construction, the concept of China and India’s version of soft power has a vast impact on its neighbors, especially in the case of Iran. By employing Joseph S. Nye’s “Soft Power” theory and forming the new concept of “Power of Bonding”, this book formulated China and India’s soft power narratives and applied it through the empirical assesses of a case study such as, China and India’s soft power strategy in the case of Iran. Based on this theory, this book seeks explanations for the question of “How China and India respectively, strategically and comparatively use the soft power resources to construct or re-affirm their zones of influence in the case of Iran?”. To answer this research question and test hypotheses developed from theories and previous literature, this study depended on different research methods such as content analysis from a news agency of Iran, IRNA, and conducted personal interviews to test the result of newspaper contents. Primary data was created by a semi-structured interview from China, India, and Iran while secondary data was collected from the previous literature, including government official reports, academic books, journals, and non-academic publications. To reach the find out, the book’s structure contains the analysis of the theory of soft power, China’s soft power strategy in Iran, and India’s soft power strategy in Iran. For empirical research, this book, thus, carries out: I) comparing the understanding, resources, strategies, influences, and uses of China and India’s soft power in the case of Iran and II) finds out and assesses the areas of influences of China and India’s soft power strategy in the case of Iran, particularly in the three thematic areas, including “power of bonding through cultural attractions, and attributions”; ‎“political and diplomatic engagement”, and “economic partnerships”. By analyzing ‎and assessing China and India’s soft power strategy in the case of Iran, this book ‎seeks to contribute to the soft power literature through a theoretical replication based ‎on non-Western soft power theory, the concept, and its empirical application in the ‎case of China and India.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Comparative Politics', 'Foreign Policy']"

The importance of searching for consistent (consistent with the known) values, determination of missing and correction of available reference data is relevant and in demand both for specialists who study electrochemical and corrosion processes and engineers who calculate durability of buildings and structures. The available reference data on oxidation–reduction half-reactions and the known values of standard electrode potential was analyzed. The peculiarities of nitrogen half-reaction behavior in acid and alkaline media were established. As a result, three groups of components in the media were identified. The first group of components is stable in acid and alkaline media, the second group is stable in acid and the third group is stable in an alkaline medium. The components of the second and third groups can pairwise change each other under the change of the medium pH. The peculiarities of the components behavior in media have necessitated the search for the consistent values of standard electrode potential for the acid and alkaline media. The relationship between these values for pH = 0 and pH = 14 was established. The reference array was supplemented with eight oxidation–reduction half-reactions with the known values of standard electrode potential. A full search of the consistent values of standard electrode potential for acid and alkaline media was carried out and structuring with the use of potential schemes was performed. The information array of standard electrode potentials and oxidation–reduction half-reactions is not fully described in the reference literature, which complicates and hinders both the calculations and practical application of corrosion processes, and restrains the development of promising directions in various branches of chemistry and construction materials science. The developed technique of searching for consistent values was used to supplement the existing information array of standard electrode potentials and oxidation–reduction half-reactions.","['Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Regional/Spatial Science']"

As a result, citizenship rights can only be enjoyed by those who can afford mobility. This contribution focusses on the personal scope of free movement of workers as the precedent of Union citizenship. The argument put forward is that the definition of worker, which constitutes the main demarcation line between economically active and inactive persons, is already marked by discrimination and arbitrariness in the identification of who is a worker under EU law. It is submitted that the establishment of Union citizenship has not solved these problems, since economic activity is still a deal breaker in the distribution of rights. Finally, this chapter argues that the inequalities that free movement of workers entails are intertwined with its double nature as economic freedom and a fundamental right and that this double nature should lead to questioning the very divide between economic activity and inactivity. Rethinking such a rift triggers questions as to the relationship between economic free movement and Union citizenship more generally.","['Law', 'Public International Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'European Law', 'Human Rights', 'Dispute Resolution, Mediation, Arbitration', 'International Criminal Law']"

Historians have made impressive progress applying this lens to curricula, extracurricular activities, college regulations, differential treatment of students, students’ enactments of femininity and masculinity, and the impact of a gendered faculty labor market. Two related themes also appear: women and intersectionality. Regarding women, robust exploration continues, featuring two arguments: commitments to women’s needs were seldom paramount in collegiate decision-making, and historians increasingly see women’s activism as only part of a larger story about markets and institutional self-interest. Regarding intersectionality, greater awareness that overlapping identities affect experience has expanded studies of different groups of students and faculty. Overall, historians have made most progress examining women’s participation, LGBTQ students and faculty, and intersections of higher education with race. Less progress appears around religion, class, and the impact of policy. The field would benefit from additional attention to racial identities beyond white and Black women, to transgender individuals, to campus staff beyond faculty, and to use of theory.","['Education', 'Higher Education', 'Educational Policy and Politics', 'Administration, Organization and Leadership', 'Sociology of Education', 'Curriculum Studies']"

For reference current generation, the SAPF uses a modified synchronous reference frame technology, an adaptive hysteresis current controller scheme, and a traditional proportional and integral-based voltage regulator. Under various loading conditions, the suggested SAPF performs remarkably well in suppressing harmonics. The suggested model was developed in MATLAB/Simulink, and the results show that it outperforms previous methods in terms of harmonic mitigation and dc-link voltage stability. The SAPF can minimize harmonics of the source current from 26.74% to 1.52% and reduces the ripples from the dc-link capacitor voltage from 22 to 8 V under steady-state condition, respectively, based on the numerical comparison of findings.","['Energy', 'Energy Systems', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks']"

The present paper addresses new simplified TOPSIS approach for the solution of generalized multilevel nonlinear multiobjective decision-making problems (MLN-MODM) incorporating major modifications in the interactive TOPSIS approach given by Baky (Appl Math Model 38:1417–1433, 2014) for MLN-MODM problems. In this work, we propose a simplified formulation model for membership functions of distance functions and for membership functions of decision variables. This avoids decision deadlock situations and repeated rejection of the solution in decision-making process for MLN-MODM problems due to the solution preference by the decision-makers. Finally, the same numerical example as taken by Baky (Appl Math Model 38:1417–1433, 2014) is illustrated with proposed simplified technique to show applicability of proposed method and similarity of results of both the approaches. Further, algorithmic comparison between suggested simplified TOPSIS approach and interactive TOPSIS approach by Baky (Appl Math Model 38:1417–1433, 2014) is also carried out to prove the simplicity of new simplified approach. The proposed simplified approach is presented as a simpler, efficient and less calculative than the earlier TOPSIS method in context of finding satisfactory solution of the problem.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Big Data', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks']"

Early stem-mammal evolution mostly involved enhanced integration of skeletal elements for feeding and locomotion as they became apex predators. With the origin of Cynodontia , modifications of the dentition, oropharynx, and braincase suggest that mastication and olfaction had become major influences in stem-mammal evolution, probably through ontogenetic cascades triggered by expression of an expanded olfactory genome. With the origin of Mammaliaformes , brain size nearly doubled in response to further elaboration of the olfactory system, dentition, the elaboration of hair, all in the context of miniaturization of adult body size. One of the keys to understanding major features in stem-mammal evolution and the origin of Mammalia is the emergence of an unsurpassed ability to perceive and process olfactory and dietary information, and to diversify and exploit the fast-changing chemical environments they faced throughout much of their history. Whether through connectional invasions and epigenetic population matching, or some other developmental mechanism, hypertrophy in peripheral sensory arrays produced cascading influences on central organization. These led to emergence of the unique mammalian neocortex and to the physiological and behavioral repertoires that are so distinctive of mammals today.","['Life Sciences', 'Evolutionary Biology', 'Paleontology', 'Vertebrates', 'Animal Anatomy / Morphology / Histology']"

These sources are used more and more because they are unlimited and environmentally friendly. Plants of such sources are much smaller and are placed close to consumers, which directly leads to reduced losses and the production of better power in the system. For the past ten years, photovoltaic systems have had more growth compared with the others. Solar energy is the energy that occurs from the sun and is stored in the battery. In this case study, a PV-battery hybrid system for International Burch University will be modeled by taking into account yearly loads from the year 2019. Thus, the study evaluates the techno-economic aspects of using this hybrid system at the university. The system consists of a photovoltaic module, a converter, and a battery. The main goal is to make a favorable solution, which is efficient and environmentally friendly, by integrating all these elements into the system. After all of the analysis was done in the HOMER software, which has different optimization algorithms, it is concluded that the best solution is the configuration made exactly of a PV-Diesel-Battery hybrid system.

Finally, MNCs are required to address not only social challenges at the BoP, but also environmental challenges (SDGs 13) in both emerging and developed countries. To balance these overall SDG-related challenges with MNCs’ own interests, BoP business is further evolving into SDG Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) business management, and MNCs will be increasingly required to redefine their role from a sustainability perspective.","['Economics', 'International Economics', 'Development Studies', 'Environmental Economics', 'Microeconomics', 'Economic Growth', 'Operations Management']"

Although some resource management frameworks exist, the majority are not designed based on distributed containerized components. Hence, they are not suitable for highly distributed and heterogeneous computing environments. Containerized resource management frameworks such as FogBus2 enable efficient distribution of framework’s components alongside IoT applications’ components. However, the management, deployment, health check, and scalability of a large number of containers are challenging issues. To orchestrate a multitude of containers, several orchestration tools are developed. But, many of these orchestration tools are heavyweight and have a high overhead, especially for resource-limited Edge/Fog nodes. Thus, for hybrid computing environments, consisting of heterogeneous Edge/Fog and/or Cloud nodes, lightweight container orchestration tools are required to support both resource-limited resources at the Edge/Fog and resource-rich resources at the Cloud. Thus, in this paper, we propose a feasible approach to build a hybrid and lightweight cluster based on K3s, for the FogBus2 framework that offers containerized resource management framework. This work addresses the challenge of creating lightweight computing clusters in hybrid computing environments. It also proposes three design patterns for the deployment of the FogBus2 framework in hybrid environments, including (1) Host Network, (2) Proxy Server, and (3) Environment Variable. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed approach improves the response time of real-time IoT applications up to 29% with acceptable and low overhead.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Statistics, general', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

This chapter aims to transform an archipelago of studies related to sonic interactions in virtual environments (SIVE) into a research field equipped with a first theoretical framework with an inclusive vision of the challenges to come: the egocentric perspective of the auditory digital twin. In a VE with immersive audio technologies implemented, the role of VR simulations must be enacted by a participatory exploration of sense-making in a network of human and non-human agents, called actors. The guardian of such locus of agency is the auditory digital twin that fosters intra-actions between humans and technology, dynamically and fluidly redefining all those configurations that are crucial for an immersive and coherent experience. The idea of entanglement theory is here mainly declined in an egocentric spatial perspective related to emerging knowledge of the listener’s perceptual capabilities. This is an actively transformative relation with the digital twin potentials to create movement, transparency, and provocative activities in VEs.

Almost uniquely on the European continent, until 1959, private law in Hungary was mostly judge-made customary law. However, the first Code from 1959 was conceived and adopted in an era in which nationalization fully liquidated private property. Therefore, after 1990, a new codification was necessary. The new Hungarian CC, like the other codifications in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states from the last thirty years, belongs to the fourth generation of codification. These CCs were born in the course of the historically late reestablishment of the private property-based society. Although the privatization of the state property was implemented by separate statutes, the new codes, including the Hungarian CC from 2013, play an important social role, similar to the classical codes in the early nineteenth century.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Civil Law', 'Fundamentals of Law']"

Moreover, organizations and employees were abruptly forced to embrace working from home due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which created unprecedented problems and inconvenience in how employees perform daily work at home that could jeopardize organizational information security. This study adapts the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework to investigate the factors that influence how employees in Vietnam protect organizational information security while working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our qualitative findings drawn from in-depth interviews with 20 respondents reveal several factors that influence the employee protection of organizational InfoSec at home, such as the use of secure software for remote work, the flexible yet distracting work environment at home, and the lack of social interactions with colleagues that could demotivate personal information security efforts. We offer practical recommendations for organizations to prepare for flexible and secure workplaces in the future, especially to meet the continuing demand for working from home after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Efficient management of these services relies on the quality of measurements of hydraulic variables in pipes and sewers to support robust analysis of systems’ performance, needed to many decision-making processes. The quality of measurements is key for the sustainability of urban water services, having a growing impact on decisions and on trade relations. Often, quantities of interest (e.g., flow rate, volume, level, and velocity), affecting net balances (e.g., inflow and outflow net balances, water losses, undue inflows and trade volumes) and used to support decision making, are obtained indirectly from a wide diversity of instrumentation, using different principles and methods. To reach acceptable accuracy, required for the measurement itself, and because of implications when used for management, three elements are critical: good measurement practices, traceability, and measurement uncertainty. Measurement uncertainty plays a relevant role today, to capture the random nature of measurement, and is considered the most reliable parameter able to provide information about the accuracy of measurement within a certain degree of confidence, allowing comparisons between instruments, practices, and methods. Advances in synergies of knowledge from Hydrology, Hydraulics, Metrology and Data Science are reported, as well as perspectives of future developments.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering']"

As a result of the availability of plentiful renewable biomass, it is possible to build a cost-effective biofuel manufacturing method at a large scale to influence sustainability. Rising fossil fuel usage, notably in the transport industry, is being blamed for the degradation of the environment, global warming, and an upsurge in the health concerns among humans associated/linked with pollution. Energy resources can be replaced by biofuels, which are also recognized as large emitters of greenhouse gases and are therefore seen to lessen the issues mentioned above. This chapter aims to evaluate the function and relevance of algae as catalysts for the long-term generation of biofuel-biobutanol. Multiple elements of biobutanol production are extensively addressed and thoroughly analyzed, including origins, synthesizing chemically, biosynthesis, generation microbially (covering utilization of natural including biologically modified organisms), as well as current advancements in biobutanol production. In recent years, this has sparked a surge in research into butanol production from renewable biomass.","['Life Sciences', 'Microbiology', 'Biological Techniques', 'Biotechnology']"

Crowdfunding has opened new possibilities to attract investors by encompassing green concerns in their agenda. This study investigates the relationship between green orientation and UK crowdfunding campaign success. We have used both qualitative and quantitative approaches to build the green orientation index, for which we have chosen 210 green campaigns out of 720 crowdfunding campaigns. Then we performed a cluster analysis to identify three clusters (social enthusiast, green fan, and tech-oriented) of green-oriented crowdfunding campaign. We performed a predictive validity analysis to identify which cluster is more effective in ensuring the crowdfunding’s performance. The results show that tech-oriented obtain the highest value and share a positive relationship with the amount raised and crowdfunding’s success. Social enthusiast effectively attracts more crowd through the social platform and thereby successfully raises funds. Green orientation, however, does not affect crowdfunding success or overfunding, which shows that there is a huge difference between the clusters, suggesting that the green orientation itself is not considered so important for the crowdfunding campaigns. It also highlights a crucial point the in the crowdfunding’s objectives, the realization of the environmental concern, society, and the long-term sustainability concern is not promising.","['Business and Management', 'IT in Business', 'Business Information Systems', 'Organization', 'Business and Management, general', 'Organizational Studies, Economic Sociology']"

So, if crisis happens, our society will be destroyed because a drop of water is more important than a sack of gold for a thirsty man. Not only drinking, but, water is also used day-to-day life in household as well as outdoor field work and various domestic works. In West Bengal, water is very essential in agricultural field. Here, ground water is limited, and now, the water level is gradually decreasing with the increasing of the population. Ground water is the one and only source of our drinking water. For preserving our ground water for the near future, the best alternative way is to utilize our monsoon season and store rain water as much as we can. If rain water is harvested properly, then it can be used in agricultural field as well as many household works so that usage of ground water decreases. There is a large variation in the amount of rainfall in the different parts of West Bengal annually. This is where the concept of rainwater harvesting comes into effect. In this paper, we describe the actual rain fall scenario in monsoon season (including pre- and post-monsoon) of West Bengal with compare to population which shows the requirement of water district wise. From this concept, we will be able to understand how much rain water harvesting is required and why it is so important? Using remote sensing and QGIS technique, we analyze district-wise rainfall data of West Bengal for a particular period of time (2002–2010). We also observed the population scenario of every district for the same period of time. For both the cases, we prepare a thematic maps. Efforts are given to make observation from the thematic that how much this process is beneficial for the society.","['Engineering', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This occurs within the melanosome, where Pmel17 is first proteolyzed into smaller domain(s) that are responsible for fibril formation. Our work has shown that the Pmel17 repeat domain (RPT, residues 315–444) forms amyloid fibrils in vitro under acidic conditions similar to those found in melanosomes. Mechanistically, this is driven by the protonation of acidic residues, resulting in charge neutralization and subsequent aggregation. Interestingly, the deprotonation of acidic residues leads to rapid disaggregation, highlighting a reversible mechanism of fibril formation and dissolution thus far only observed for functional amyloid proteins. In this chapter, we describe how to monitor pH-dependent RPT aggregation and disaggregation using extrinsic thioflavin-T and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, respectively. These methods can also be adapted more broadly to investigate the reversibility of other amyloid systems, both functional and pathogenic.","['Chemistry', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general', 'Spectroscopy/Spectrometry']"

It has been implemented by multiple advanced device modeling research groups in conjunction with multiple quantum transport methodologies. Industry has begun to adopt some of the advanced codes and is beginning to implement company internal versions. Commercial software vendors are adopting the methodologies and are beginning to deploy the approaches into their commercial TCAD products. Intense software development combining tight-binding with the non-equilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) Non-equilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) approach and quantum transmitting boundary method (QTBM) for quantum transport began in 1994 at Texas Instruments. Acceptance of NEGF and tight-binding began with wider adoption in about 2004. The past 25 years have resulted in many model advancements, numerical technology development, and physics exploration that is by far too large to be covered here comprehensively. We start by setting forth the requirements for realistic modeling of extended nanoscale devices (Sects. 45.1 and 45.2 ), which include a full quantum mechanical treatment, atomistic interface treatments, atomistic representations of crystal symmetries, polarization, strain, and bond directions, and embedding into macroscopic fields such as electromagnetic potentials and long-range strain. We then proceed to describe the essential definitions and features for empirical tight-binding (Sect. 45.3 ). Sections 45.4 , 45.5 , and 45.6 address numerical issues of tight-binding in terms of transfer matrices, Green’s functions, and parallel scaling. Section  45.7 is dedicated to several applications around quantum dots and nanowires. We highlight million-atom quantum dot simulations and focus on carrier transport though silicon nanowires. We demonstrate how effective masses and bandgaps become design parameters at the nanoscale, how heavy masses are desirable for end-of-roadmap transistors, and how coherent transport assumptions break down. The nanowire simulations can be duplicated by everyone on nanoHUB.org. Section  45.8 highlights the widespread use of tight-binding within nanoHUB applications.

The structure and function of urban ecosystem have changed, which has affected the service function of urban ecosystem. Urban ecosystem services are closely related to human well-being. Therefore, quantifying urban ecosystem services can better guide urban planning and optimize urban structure. In this chapter, we take China as case study to assess the urban ecosystem services from multiple scales, take Chongqing of China as case study to assess ecosystem service flow, and analyze the entropy value and entropy flow of ecosystem. Firstly, the ecosystem service cluster model was constructed to analyze the changes of ecosystem services in different provinces of China. Secondly, a cluster analysis model was established to group different provinces based on the national scale. Finally, an integrated analysis with the assessment matrix and entropy flow method was used to spatially identify and effectively quantify the ecosystem services flow of Chongqing, China. Our methods and findings can provide theoretical guidance for urban landscape planning, management, and policymaking by considering the ecosystem services and ecosystem health of urban scale.","['Life Sciences', 'Urban Ecology', 'Sustainable Development', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Cities, Countries, Regions']"

The aim is to determine the components for ensuring food price stability and combating food inflation. In order to examine the relationship, agricultural commodity daily price volatility is analyzed with the GARCH methodology, in the periods before and after the national spot market launch in July 2019. Explanatory factors in the model are US dollar/Turkish lira, Turkish lira overnight interest rate and Brent oil return series. It is observed that; shocks in US dollar/Turkish lira returns has a positive effect on the wheat and maize price returns and increase their volatility. Contrary to the positive effect of the US dollar/Turkish lira series on wheat and maize price returns, shocks in Brent oil price returns have a negative effect on these commodities. When compared with the daily price changes within the national agricultural mercantile exchange (TMEX) with the previous decentralized commodity markets period, it has been observed that TMEX has brought stability to the market with a decreasing daily price fluctuation range and contributes to healthy price formation.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

What does the dominant role of English mean for the ICC’s ability to further the international criminal justice project? How does the status of English at the Court privilege those professionals for whom it is a native language, as well as the legal framework they bring with them? What kinds of conceptual limitations does dependence on a single language create for an institution aiming to promote what it considers globally applicable principles? Does the ICC’s objective of delivering global justice enable, in fact, the dominance of the contemporary worldwide lingua franca without too much pushback?

Hence, developing cities and buildings towards net-zero goals is becoming urgent and significantly vital to adopt renewable scenarios in the building sector given the climate crisis. The outcome of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of Parties (COP26) agreed on and declared the Glasgow Climate Pact (GCP) which stated the serious concern of climate and weather extremes and their adverse impacts on people and nature that will continue to increase with an additional increment of rising temperature. The GCP reaffirmed the long-term global goal to hold the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 °C below-industrial real levels in addition to recognizing that limiting global warming to 1.5 entails rapid, deep, and sustained reduction in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 45% by 2030 and to contribute towards climate-neutral cities and reasserted the goal of net-zero by 2050. Hence, city leaders should focus on reducing carbon emissions by 2050. Nevertheless, if global warming is to be limited to 1.5 °C, all cities need to be net-zero by 2050 at the very latest. Therefore, net-zero, low-carbon building and clean mobility can play a great role in achieving climate neutrality by 2050. This book chapter aims to address the urgent need to transform the building industry and cities to become low carbon. The chapter highlights the importance of net-zero low-carbon cities. It also presents global examples of net-zero-energy buildings (NZEBs) and how these models contribute to the net-zero target and climate neutrality. Additionally, current policies, actions, and initiatives worldwide and in Egypt towards NZEB to achieve green and sustainable cities have also been examined and discussed. Ultimately, net-zero carbon and managing “transition” remain a huge challenge for cities and regions, but coupling these goals with innovative thinking for the future is primarily essential if cities worldwide are to become resilient enough and meet COP26 outcomes and the GCP.","['Energy', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management']"

In addition to posing a threat to human health, human waste contains high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus, which can wreak ecological harm when improperly discharged. However, nitrogen and phosphorus are also key ingredients for fertilizers used in agricultural food production. This case study follows the development of ElectroSan, a pre-revenue process engineering spinoff that focuses on novel processes for converting urine into valuable products. The two primary technologies ElectroSan uses to extract nitrogen from urine are ion exchange and electrochemical stripping. The efficacy of these technologies (primarily ion exchange) was investigated through field trials enabled by a partnership with Sanergy in Nairobi, Kenya. Through experimentation and market analyses, Dowex Mac 3 was identified as the most suitable resin for nitrogen recovery. Additionally, this process could produce ammonium sulfate fertilizer at a lower cost to competing products and also had the advantages of providing a steady, local supply of fertilizer that could be applied by fertigation. This approach thus avoided local ecosystem damage from improper disposal, created local economic opportunities, and partially closed the nutrient cycle locally. Life cycle and techno-economic assessments (in the context of San Francisco, CA) found that the sulfuric acid used for regeneration of the resin represented 70% of greenhouse gas emissions and energy input (embedded energy from the manufacturing process). Providing insights into the importance of partnerships, being adaptive with assumptions, and the realities of conducting fieldwork, the ElectroSan research project continues to explore the valorization of urine and has expanded to new contexts, including other parts of Kenya (with Sanivation) and Dakar, Senegal (with Delvic Sanitation Initiatives).","['Environment', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Development Economics', 'Development and Sustainability', 'Engineering Design', 'Social/Human Development Studies']"

Wind speed prediction is required to enhance the quantity of energy generated. The wind speed forecast balances the energy required and the energy generated. Voltage stability has recently received a lot of attention from academics due to the fact that it has become a key concern for modern power system operators. Several countries have experienced widespread blackouts as a result of voltage instability issues. Accurate forecasting of power demand and price is considered as one of the most significant research topics in electrical engineering in the present and future, with academics placing a strong focus on demand and price prediction in deregulated markets. The predictive nature of various machine learning algorithms makes them most suitable tool to deal with problems related to energy and power engineering. Machine learning techniques are capable of analyzing past data and on the basis of that analysis, these algorithms are capable of predicting future results. This article provides applications of machine learning in energy and power engineering.","['Engineering', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Materials Science, general', 'Nanotechnology']"

I argue that he is forged as an imperial man of feeling who learns to align social duty with sentiment. Austen’s vision of Darcy, I demonstrate, draws upon her reading of Henry Mackenzie’s epistolary novel Julia de Roubigné (1777) as a satire of sentimentalism rather than a validation of it, as Butler asserts. Darcy’s emphatically unsentimental use of the letter form in his famous letter to Elizabeth following his failed proposal shows how Austen has dispensed with the epistolary genre as a vehicle for feeling. Instead, the letter becomes a site for duty, sincerity and moral improvement, Puritanical principles that Butler argues characterize the novel as a whole. Darcy is not only an ideal romantic hero, but an ideal Briton at the heart of empire, ready to anchor the landed ancien régime of England as it moves into the burgeoning era of global domination, with a solidified morality rooted in Protestant supremacy.","['Literature', 'Nineteenth-Century Literature', 'Literature, general', 'Literary Theory']"

From this complex debate three dominant visions emerge—intergovernmentalism, neo-functionalism and post-functionalism—which can be used to better understand the current developments of the EU political system. For instance, they can shed light on the complex appointment process of the von der Leyen Commission which was quite conflictual and messy. It highlighted the tensions between various visions of the EU and the deep disagreement among actors on the role of the EP in the process. Some national leaders were expecting the EP to approve what had been negotiated within the European Council with the elected President of the Commission. However, despite the failure of the Spitzenkandidaten process, or because of it, most MEPs intended to exert real control over the commissioners-designate. This tension peaked with the rejection of French commissioner-designate Sylvie Goulard. This paper assesses this sequence through the lenses of the main theories of European integration. By doing so, it aims at improving our understanding of the existing institutional dynamics within the EU political system.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Legislative and Executive Politics']"

The past decades have witnessed the positive expansion of Islamic banking in Southeast Asia but a discernible drop in their profitability and assets growth may denote poor performance. This requires investigation. This quantitative study examined the factors that may influence Islamic banks’ financial performance, and found Assets Quality, Liquidity, Debt Funding and Equity funding as the significant parameters in determining Islamic banks’ financial performance among the countries examined. Also, GDP Growth Rate and interest rate were the only external parameters with positive influence on Islamic banks’ financial performance. Notably, Inflation and Tax rate were not significant in determining Islamic Banks’ financial performance. Accordingly, management should strengthen the practices and implementations of the profit loss sharing (PLS) based instruments among the examined Islamic banks. Hence, disparities could be decreased while the economic opportunities could be improved, particularly those that could greatly contribute to the capital build-up and the creation of economic growth.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

The performance of an NH 3 /LiNO 3 absorption chiller with a nominal capacity of 352 kW is assessed using natural gas and solar energy for driving of the system. The solar irradiation in the city selected, the cooling requirements in three selected shopping malls, and roof area available for evacuated solar collectors were parameter considered for the study as well. For the evaluation of the chiller, a thermodynamic model is developed to estimate the effects of the environmental variables on the operation of the absorption system to produce chilled water at 12 °C. The estimated cooling effect provided by conventional compression chillers is used as the cooling target to be covered by the absorption chillers. Results showed that the area available for solar collectors is the main limitation for the installation of solar/gas absorption systems in malls. The peak cooling effect target was totally covered in mall two considering two solar/gas assisted chillers and a solar collector area of 2210 m 2 . In mall one, 83% of the peak cooling load was provided by two chillers, while for mall three, only 35% of the peak cooling load was provided by one chiller given the limitations in the area available for solar collectors.

doi:10.1007/978-981-19-1142-2_3,en,A Novel Compression Method for Transmitting Multimedia Data in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks,OriginalPaper,"This paper discusses various compression methods used in wireless sensor networks. Compressed sensing is the emerging signal processing tool that makes the transmission of data easy via low-data rate links. In the wireless sensor network applications, a group of sensors is used to sense any events and make decisions, and the collaborated information sensed by different tiny sensing devices are used to give the decisions about the occurrence of the particular events. According to the different applications and data types, the quality of service parameters and designing parameters for nodes are different. For dealing with low bandwidth in a sensor network, it is most important to reduce the transmitted data bits between sensor nodes or from nodes to sink. In the case of multimedia data such as image signals, the compression is beneficial for the reduction of these bits because fewer bits required less transmission energy. In some situations of the multimedia sensor network, some loss is accepted without affecting the too much quality of results. Data collected by nodes are spatially correlated with each other, so the image samples collected over time by the nodes are also correlated with each other. If only some samples are transmitted, then these samples are sufficient to give the knowledge about the suspected object inside the monitoring area, so the transformation-based compression technique is the good solution for the compression in the case of the multimedia sensor network. In this paper, a Hadamard transform-based compression technique is discussed for image compression with the consideration of different designing parameters of an image signal. In that manner, this work helps us to select the transform and source coding schemes for the compression of image data inside the wireless multimedia sensor network.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Mobile and Network Security', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This makes the creative practice highly dependent on construction viability, most design decisions having to consider, among others, the available materials and construction techniques and the associated manufacturing costs. Nevertheless, the desire to conceive complex geometries has always been present in architecture, often leading to innovative solutions and structures that go beyond what had been done to date. The emergence of computational design in the last decades has further accentuated this ambition by providing architects with unprecedented design freedom. The realization of such shapes, however, is not as easy as its 3D modeling due to limitations in the available manufacturing strategies. In this paper, we address this problem with Algorithm Design (AD), a design approach based on algorithms, presenting a design workflow that benefits from its (1) geometric freedom in developing facade design solutions and (2) expressiveness in converting and detailing the obtained solutions for manufacturing. We evaluate our proposal with an algorithmically developed prototype of a geometrically complex facade. The aim is to illustrate its potential in exploring design alternatives that consider multiple design criteria, while automatically detailing them for construction and producing the corresponding technical documentation. We also intend to demonstrate the importance of the proposal’s flexibility in considering different construction schemes that, in turn, result in different aesthetic outcomes and manufacturing needs.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Statistics, general']"

Therefore, there is a need to optimize the structure of the energy balance of the state, based on the requirements of energy security and ensure the share of renewable energy at 25%. However, with the development of renewable energy sources (RESs) there is a problem of ensuring the appropriate maneuverability of the power system. This is due to the fact that the structure of generating capacity of the United Power System of Ukraine in terms of effective regulation of frequency and power in the power system is suboptimal. Among the reasons for this, the main ones are unregulated and variable operation of a SPP, which is exacerbated by the lack of tools and approaches for the power generation modes forecasting. That is why the issue of accurate forecasting of the possible electricity generation volume has become acute. However, solar energy forecasting is a rather difficult task, as it largely depends on climatic conditions that change over time. This study presents an analysis and application of the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) method to develop a model that can support and provide forecasting the amount of power produced by SPP. Data for the development of the model were obtained from the time series of electricity generation on the example of the SPP in the village of Velyka Dymerka, Kyiv region. The data consisted of more than 26 thousand samples collected from July 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020, which characterize the operating conditions of solar panels with a capacity of 9 MW. This led to the choice of the SARIMA model. The coefficient of determination (R 2 ) for the obtained model was 92%. This indicates the ability of the final model to accurately represent and give forecast based on data set of the SPP power generation.","['Energy', 'Energy Systems', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Control and Systems Theory']"

With the development of technology, several ways to prevent these risks are possible. Recently, robots that collaborate with humans assist workers by undertaking heavy and repetitive tasks. However, in order to achieve this benefit, many issues such as design, integration, control, task assignment, scheduling of robots must carefully be considered. Therefore, new research topics in this area, along with the need for new methods and tools, have arisen. This study contributes to the Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) literature by evaluating the studies that deal with ergonomics in design and planning together. High-quality articles from 2009 to the beginning of 2021 are included in this literature review. The main intent of this paper is to highlight gaps and contradictions of previous studies.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Business and Management, general', 'Computational Intelligence']"

The population of Android mobile users has been increasing, and the number continues to grow as the number of mobile users increases. Primarily, the applications used in Android devices are distributed via the Google Play Store. These applications are required to meet several criteria in order to be distributed via the Play Store. However, attackers sometimes find their way to compromise the Android operating system devices and steal users’ sensitive information. Malicious software or malware is designed to extract data from users by compromising their devices for financial gain or other reasons. This study uses machine learning algorithms to detect Android malware in the Android malware dataset. Using CICAndMal2017 dataset, random sampling was done to extract a balanced dataset. Feature engineering was performed to obtain the most significant features. Machine learning algorithms were trained using the balanced dataset with selected features. Initially, all the models were trained using ‘Label’ as the target variable and then ‘Family’ as the target variable. Maximum accuracy of approximately 99% was obtained using random forest in both cases.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Statistics, general']"

Flat slabs are the vertical load resisting members that has various advantages compared to the conventional slab system. It reduces the storey heights and hence conservatively increase the total number of floors. In comparison to conventional slab 70% of the cost saving is done in case of Flat slabs and 50% cost saving in case of formwork. Due to the controversy that the flat slab system is least resistant to seismic forces, there is a need to study flat slab with bracing and flat slab without bracing. The analysis was carried out using Abaqus software for both static and dynamic cases. The structure is modeled for linear static and non-linear dynamic analysis under prestressing forces. The analysis was carried out manually using Load balancing principle and Equivalent frame method. The structure was modelled and analyzed using Abaqus software. The analysis results stated that, though the stresses and the displacement in the flat slab with braces are reduced considerably than that for flat slab without braces, the stresses and displacement produced are within the limits for the loading considered. Hence, in this case considered for warehouse building and for the considered loading conditions the stresses and displacement are within the limits for both cases. The stresses and displacement are within the limits and safe against lateral forces. The overall preference in the flat slab element leads to optimum design.","['Materials Science', 'Structural Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

In an MA-based system, a small-sized processing code is transmitted through the network rather than the raw data. Using strong migration capability, MA’s processing code is being executed at each targeted node. Subsequently, useful and significant information is delivered to the intended user. Despite its benefit, MA has its issues also. Finding the appropriate number of MAs to be dispatched, the set of targeted nodes and their sequence of migration are the major issues related to multi-mobile agent itinerary planning (MIP). This paper tries to find a suitable number of MAs by considering the size of the data payload of a single MA and the load to be carried out by the MAs from the whole network. Moreover, this paper gives an idea of partitioning the given network into load balanced and nonoverlapping clusters using a fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

Instead of using fixed integer order derivatives as usual, fractional order derivatives are used because of the possibility of adjustment. To estimate the unknown dynamic model, a radial basis function neural network is used. The control law is constructed from a candidate of the Lyapunov function in order to assure the stability of sliding surfaces, and an updated law for neural network weight matrices is derived from it. Simulation findings show that the suggested control technique is effective, resulting in a lower swing and more precise location tracking as anticipated.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Electrical Engineering']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-13150-9_34,en,Data Sampling Methods for Analyzing Publishers Conduct from Highly Imbalanced Dataset in Web Advertising,OriginalPaper,"Due to the involvement of a huge amount of expenditure, the Pay-per-Click digital advertising model is affected by click fraud. The rare presence of illegitimate publishers than the legitimates makes the class distribution skewed which in turn biases the learning model towards the majority class. Moreover, the dynamic disguise activities of publishers make the task harder to investigate the actual status labels of the publishers, resulting in less accurate predictions. However, features reported in the literature detect click fraud based on analyzing the publishers’ conduct but are unable to cope with the changing behavior of publishers. Therefore, we proposed a framework addressing two challenging issues: a) eight new conditional features are proposed to better capture the dynamics of click fraud behavior by merging two or more attributes over publishers on finer-grained time intervals. b) Examined the impact of data sampling methods on learners’ performance for the effective identification of publisher’s activity. The performance of the classification algorithms is assessed using average precision, recall, and f-measure and validated using 10-fold cross-validation. Experimental results illustrate the potential of the proposed features over a balanced dataset in improving the average precision of the learners in discriminating the fraudsters among genuine publishers.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Management']"

The concept of the vehicle to grid (V2G) technology makes it possible to integrate electric vehicles (EVs) into the grid as distributed energy resources and provide power balancing service to the grid. This chapter introduces a V2G scheduling approach that can provide power balancing services to the grid while mitigating the battery aging phenomenon. Firstly, an intelligent V2G behaviour management framework is presented, which enables the comprehensive utilization of prediction information in V2G scheduling. Then, a commonly used multi-objective V2G behavior optimization model is introduced, in which minimal battery degradation and grid load fluctuation are the optimization objectives. Meanwhile, a multi-population collaborative mechanism, which is particularly designed for the V2G scheduling problem and has been proved effective in previous literature, is also introduced to improve the performance of the heuristic optimization-based V2G scheduling model. Two commonly used real-time strategy deployment methods: fuzzy logic and neural network, are further introduced for online V2G scheduling. With the presented methods, grid-connected electric vehicle (GEV) energy storage capacity can be scheduled to provide power balancing services to the grid while significantly mitigating battery aging.","['Engineering', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

Homozygous individuals possess type 1 alleles encoding Hp and are characterized by high expression of Hp1-1. The Hp2-2 phenotype is present in homozygous individuals who only have type 2 alleles. Heterozygous individuals have type 1 and type 2 alleles, which is associated with high expression of Hp2-1. The structural structure of haptoglobin chains determines its properties and functions. Hp1-1 short chains easily imply complexes with hemoglobin and enhance the production of anti-inflammatory markers, i.e., CD163, IL-10, and HO-1. Consequently, Hp1-1 plays a protective role by reducing oxidative stress and chronic inflammation in the body. In contrast, Hp2-2 is a long-chain protein which makes it difficult to complex hemoglobin. Free hemoglobin increases the production of ROS, which increases inflammation, which can lead to the development of many diseases, including complications in people with type 2 diabetes, such as cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, and nephropathy. It has been suggested that the Hp2-2 phenotype is also associated with the increase in bacterial and viral infections, which are one of the causes of higher mortality in people with diabetes. In this review, we also demonstrated an ambiguous role for haptoglobin in, for example, neurodegenerative diseases where Hp2-2 appears to be protective. Nevertheless, we suggest that the Hp1-1 phenotype may be a valuable genetic marker in assessing the possibility of various complications in people with diabetes mellitus.","['Biomedicine', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Pharmacology/Toxicology']"

These chemicals have been placed in a variety of products, some of which are available over the counter and are commonly used. Since many PPPCPs enter the environment they have been commonly identified as contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). Many PPCPs are released form households where they enter the municipal waste stream and ultimately enter a wastewater treatment facility (WWTF). Researchers have characterized the presence of PPCPs through the waste stream and treatment facilities and ultimately in aquatic and terrestrial environments impacted by wastewater treatment end products. In comparison with parent PPCPs, transformation products (TPs) of these compounds are poorly characterized in the same environments. However, mounting evidence suggests that understanding TPs is as critical to understanding the fate and effects of PPCPs as the parent compound. Human metabolites of many PPCPs are known, but TPs of PPCPs can be produced in WWTFs and after be released in the natural environment. PPCPs that are in WWTFs are commonly transformed by both biotic and abiotic processes and not removed from the water system but released along with the TPs into surface waters, that may be used for municipal drinking water downstream or increasingly used as a source of non-potable water for agricultural uses. Some PPCPs and TPs can partition into the sludge phase during wastewater treatment, with a large portion of sludge produced being land-applied as a soil amendment (biosolids). The effects on the environment at times are difficult to quantify because the repercussions can be far reaching and there is a great need to elucidate the pathways and TPs formed as well as the effects on the biome.","['Environment', 'Environmental Chemistry', 'Waste Management/Waste Technology', 'Agriculture', 'Pollution, general', 'Applied Microbiology']"

Such an aproach will make their interactions with surrounding technology closer to them. Therefore, there is a recurrent need in contemporary technological solutions to create proposals to assist users in a way that is not exclusive to them and makes them feel integrated into the intelligent system. In fact, this is particularly relevant when the proposed technology or system aims to nudge users to form, shape, or change their daily behaviours. In essence, solutions designed for assisting users in that matter need to consider the inclusion of humans in the learning/decision loop and still the literature in the field is scarce. In this work, we identify and address three crucial human requirements that this technology has to integrate to promote a comfortable and long-term use of technology for the effective assistance of behaviour change: trust, engagement, and adaptation. Besides, we propose a collaborative workflow based on hybrid intelligent systems to cover the lack of human requirements and needs of traditional approaches. In essence, this work aims to shed light on how to promote closer collaboration between humans and intelligent agents for behaviour change under the principle that people should not be treated as mere users of technologies and services, but their behaviour should become one of the critical levers for designing and using technologies. That is, creating a closer interaction between these technologies and people.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Nowadays, the world is facing the problem of different environmental pollution. The industrial pollutants and runoff water from the agriculture fields contained various organic and xenobiotic compounds. The usage of aromatics, plasticizers and pesticides in day-to-day life in cosmetic products, ripe fruits and vegetables, etc. are one of the major concerns since of their commercial usage and predictable potential threats that have to posed human health and ecosystem. These compounds are toxic. Microorganisms also play vital role in dealing with problems related to environment like decomposition and many more good factors for which microorganisms are responsible. This is because the microorganisms decompose dead organic waste of plants and animals converting them into simple substances. Thus, microorganisms can be used to degrade the harmful and smelly substances and thereby clean up the environment. These organisms have survived in all places on the biosphere because of their metabolic activity due to their existence in all over range of environmental conditions. Bioremediation involves the use of microbes and is also considered to be the most efficient, cost-effective, and eco-friendly method to eliminate industrial pollutants from the environment. They are involved in degradation, eradication, immobilization, or detoxification of diverse chemical wastes and physical hazardous materials from the surrounding through the comprehensive action of microorganisms’ and their overall results. However, microorganisms are also play a vital to agriculture, industry, and ecology. In fact, life on Earth would not survive without microorganisms. There are two types of factors such as biotic and abiotic conditions which determines the rate of degradation. Currently, there are different methods and strategies that have been applied in the area in different parts of the world such as biostimulation, bioaugmentation, bioventing, biopiles, and bioattenuation. This chapter focuses on the degradation pathway of microbes in wastewater treatment, petroleum hydrocarbons, DDT degradation, and pesticide residues that are used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and in day-to-day household products.","['Life Sciences', 'Microbial Ecology', 'Microbiology', 'Environment, general', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology', 'Sustainable Development']"

As the literature only discusses the effect of the absolute value of housing wealth on homeowners’ labor supply, this paper studies how a homeowner’s relative housing wealth—i.e., perceived housing wealth gain compared with their reference group-affects labor market behavior. Using China’s housing boom as a natural experiment, we first construct homeowners’ reference housing wealth using the hedonic method and then estimate the effect of homeowners’ relative housing wealth on labor supply. Subsequently, we identify a causal effect of relative housing wealth on homeowners’ labor supply using an instrumental variable approach and find that an appreciation in relative housing wealth does not significantly influence homeowners’ employment, but significantly reduces their working hours. Our results show that this reduction in working hours is mainly driven by female homeowners. Our results also suggest that the effects of relative housing wealth vary across educational backgrounds, marital statuses, and locations. We find that the effect is more pronounced for female homeowners who are less educated, married, and living in rural areas. Moreover, a set of robustness checks corroborates the validity of our identification strategies and tests the sensitivity of the results.","['Economics', 'Regional/Spatial Science', 'Financial Services']"

These CNN-architectures are therefore unnecessarily costly to train and deploy. The increase in network-complexity also results in diminishing returns in terms of the predictive quality. The receptive field of a convolutional layer is strictly limiting the features it can process. We can consistently predict unproductive layers that will not contribute qualitatively to the test performance in a given CNN architecture, by analyzing the receptive field expansion over the network. Since the receptive field is a property of the architecture itself, this analysis does not require training the model. We refer to this analysis technique as Receptive Field Analysis (RFA). In this work, we demonstrate that RFA can be used to guide the optimization of CNN architectures by predicting the presence of unproductive layers. We show that RFA allows the deduction of design decisions and simple design strategies that reliably improve the parameter efficiency of the model on the given task. We further demonstrate that these RFA-guided strategies can reliably improve the predictive performance, computational efficiency or strike a balance between the two. Finally, we show that RFA can also be used to define an interval of feasible input resolutions for any modern architecture, in which the model will operate with high efficiency, while being able to extract any pattern from the image. This allows practitioners to pick efficient input resolutions when adapting models for novel tasks.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Mathematical Models of Cognitive Processes and Neural Networks']"

During the analyses, parabolic trough solar collectors were used to meet the necessary thermal energy for the power and refrigeration cycles. For the absorption refrigeration, the H 2 O-LiBr cycle was proposed for the integrated system in order to maintain chilled water. The analysis was carried out for three supercritical working fluids: carbon dioxide (R744), ethane (R170), and fluoromethane (R41). For specified parabolic trough collector parameters, energetic and exergetic performances of the cycles were determined for constant turbine inlet pressure and constant pressure ratio. A parametrical study was also implemented for determining the effect of the system parameters on cycle performances. According to the results, the best performance was achieved using R41 with a net energy production rate of 32.54 kW, followed by R170 and R744. Based on the results of the exergy analysis, the leading exergy destruction rate was estimated for the integrated cycle working with R744.

The effect of changes in freshwater temperature, pond water temperature, the cold and hot side flow rate of the heat exchanger, and heat transfer coefficient of the heat exchanger were investigated. Incorporating pond water and heat exchanger reduce the treated water temperature by 1.5° in June and 0.5 °C in July. Sensitivity analysis showed that the pond water temperature had the greatest impact among other parameters in the studied ranges.

Furthermore, identifying threats and the ability to remain updated on current threats and vulnerabilities are often dependent on skilled and experienced experts, causing risks to be primarily determined based on subjective judgment [46]. Nevertheless, this also poses a challenge to organizations that cannot stay up-to-date with what assets are vulnerable or attain personnel with the necessary experience and know-how to obtain relevant information on cybersecurity threats towards those assets [8, 30, 37].","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Privacy', 'Cryptology', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

In recognition of these synergies, a multi-year project has been initiated in Ontario through funding from the province’s Independent Electricity System Operator to promote water loss reduction practices. The project involves the development and deployment of a mobile testing unit designed as an affordable method to accurately and reliably measure minimum night flow (MNF), an indicator of leakage, into discrete sectors of water distribution systems commonly referred to as district metered areas (DMAs). In addition to flow monitoring, the mobile unit is equipped with a pressure reducing valve (PRV) to directly test the effectiveness of pressure moderation on leakage reduction. More broadly, the project involves the collection of data across 22 DMA sites in Ontario with results informing the development and application of evidence-based benchmarking metrics used to assess the performance of DMAs in similar municipalities elsewhere. Moreover, analyses of the project’s testing results, previous DMA work and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) data are presented to support the establishment of MNF benchmarks (representing healthy systems). While this project is still ongoing, initial successes have proven the mobile testing unit concept and substantial value has already been realized.

The physical environment in which jail residents live drastically impacts their daily routines, accessibility to services, and feelings of safety and security. Considering most jails in the United States are binarily sex-segregated and house significantly more men than women, the gendered nature of these facilities is particularly apparent in the purposive design of these facilities. For women, the design of a facility may act as a barrier to getting their needs met because facilities are not constructed to specifically meet their needs which differ in number and types from the needs of men. Using a case study of one jail, this chapter will dissect how the carceral space, layout, and design of the facility makes it challenging to ensure the needs of women are met through connections to educational programming and health services.

Plenty of numerical schemes can be employed in predicting and analysing the discontinuities flow phenomena that may present in the high-speed flow. These schemes have been integrated into software packages such as Open-source Field Operation and Manipulation (OpenFOAM) and ANSYS, which incorporate a graphical user interface (GUI) that complicates user interaction and are computationally demanding. The previous implementation of the Flux Vector Splitting (FVS) schemes is limited to a typical wave propagating flow only. Hence, the objective of this research is to develop a first-order Flux Vector Splitting (FVS) schemes and extend the solution capabilities to flow with two shocks such as the Woodward-Collela blast wave problem. Three FVS schemes have been selected, Steger-Warming, Van Leer, and Liou-Steffen scheme. Execution of these schemes over the test cases has shown different flow patterns according to each test case's extremities. The ability of the schemes in capturing shock is also analysed. The results over the one-dimensional test cases have shown that the Steger-Warming scheme produced the largest dissipation. In contrast, the Liou-Steffen scheme has shown itself as the most accurate, with very few overshoots and undershoots. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK) method augmented with second-order Time Variation Diminishing (TVD) has been previously implemented but limited to internal flow within a body surface. This research aims to extend the capabilities of the method for previously untested geometries such as flow over a wedge and a blunt-body. The results obtained from the scheme exhibits oblique shock waves at the compression corners and expansion waves at expansion corners. The presence of the waves is apparent at Mach number M∞ = 2.0 for the inlet, wedge, and bump channel geometries, while bow shocks can be simulated using the blunt-body geometry. The results obtained for the one-dimensional and two-dimensional problems confirm the shock-capturing ability of these schemes.","['Engineering', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation']"

We begin by conceptualizing the state, adopting a strategic-relational approach that allows us to overcome the structure-agency division and to understand the state as a complex relationship. We situate this theoretical reflection within the study of neoliberalism as a form of governmentality, offering an approach that is not limited to the field of economics. Neoliberalism is driven by states, through states, and develops within states themselves. Therefore, on a more concrete level, we analyze the most direct consequence of neoliberalism: the privatization of democracy. While this model does strategically reinforce private institutions and actors, it is also necessary to study the resistance and alternative proposals for democratization that arise in response. We analyze the case of Basque majority unionism to draw attention to democratization strategies employed by subjects formerly included in the “power bloc” and subsequently expelled in the post-Fordist era. We conclude that one strategy for democratization is based on a re-territorialization of power through public institutionalization, including not only the subjects and classes more recently excluded from power through neoliberal governmentality, but others that were not central in other forms of governmentality either. We call this strategy “communitarian statism.”","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Public Policy']"

Car-Driver Handover Control in Highly Automated Vehicles,OriginalPaper,"The future development of fully automated vehicle cannot be predicted yet. Car Cars -driver handover control need be existed in a certain period, but it is not well understood. The present study is to gain deeper insight into car Cars -driver handover control in the highly automated vehicle by investigating the effects of mode transition, the time of transition to takeover request (TTR-time) and take over request time (TOR-time). Two experiments were conducted via driving simulator. Experiment 1 invited twenty participants to analyze the influence of TOR-time when resuming control. Experiment 2 recruited forty participants to further explore the effects of mode transition, TTR-time and TOR-time with a 2 * 2 * 2 mixed design. The shorter TOR-time resulted in less takeover reaction time but worse quality. Six seconds was the balance point between less takeover reaction time and higher handover control quality. In addition, the shorter TTR-time aggravated the significant difference of takeover reaction time caused by TOR-time, but the longer TTR-time abridged the significant difference and improved the attitude towards TOR-time during transition from level 3 to level 2 of automation. If the TOR-time is needed to be reduced in the design for acute threats, no less than six seconds would be better. If the future autonomous vehicle involves the mode transition of automation levels, designer Designers and engineer also should take the time of mode transition to takeover request into account. These findings provide practical implications for the takeover control design of highly automated vehicles.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Following an initial phase of institutional development of the community model, integration, particularly since the Empty Chair Crisis, has drifted towards an increasingly intergovernmental model in greater tension with the foundational supranational spirit. In recent years, Europe has again found itself faced by enormous challenges (economic crisis, Brexit, pandemic, rise of new powers, etc.).

Moreover, for several years the EU has been engaged in a debate on its future, which began with the Commission’s White Paper in March 2017 and will culminate in 2022 with the conclusions of the Conference on the Future of Europe (CoFoE). However, the interesting concepts included in the debate – strategic autonomy, European sovereignty – run the risk of limiting their scope to functional developments, without sufficient exploration of democratic aspects. Furthermore, the concept of European sovereignty, if restricted to a replication of state sovereignty on a European scale, would find its transformative and democratic potential significantly curtailed.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Public Policy']"

Although their presumed Early Triassic origins remain obscured, the subsequent radiation and diversification of these diapsid superorders is reasonably well documented in the fossil record. In the first quarter of the twentieth century, the Triassic sauropterygian genera Nothosaurus and Placodus were among the first taxa for which the cranial endocast was extracted and described. The advent of computed tomography, circa 50 years after these pivotal paleoneurological investigations, has led to its adoption as the tool of choice for the non-destructive assessment of neurosensory adaptations in extinct vertebrates. Despite the increasing availability of paleoneurological data on extinct diapsids, Ichthyopterygia and Sauropterygia have received relatively modest, albeit growing, attention since. Here we review paleoneurological insights gleaned from these fossils to date and identify endocranial and neurosensory modifications associated with increasingly pelagic lifestyles and ecological specializations. Nevertheless, a broader ichthyopterygian and sauropterygian sample will be required to facilitate high-resolution taxon-wide comparisons and discern between endocranial changes accompanying progressive adaptation to aquatic niches and conservative features informing on phylogenetic identity. Systematic evaluation will reveal the neurosensory developments that facilitated these Mesozoic ecological success stories in aquatic environments.","['Life Sciences', 'Evolutionary Biology', 'Paleontology', 'Vertebrates', 'Animal Anatomy / Morphology / Histology']"

The impacts of cutting parameters such as feed rate, cutting speed, and depth of cut on output responses such as cutting forces, flank wear, and surface roughness were investigated using a Box-Behnken design based on response surface methodology (RSM). To find the optimum cutting condition, a newly developed hybrid optimization method, namely RSM-linked Artificial Gorilla Troop Optimization Algorithm and Dingo Optimization Algorithm, was utilized. The flank wear along with cutting force was recorded when the depth of cut was less while better surface finish was achieved with lower cutting speed. Additionally, analysis of variance was used to determine the most important component in each of the three responses, followed by a confirmatory test that revealed a high degree of agreement between anticipated and experimental results. As per the analysis of variance (ANOVA) results, the depth of cut was determined to be the most crucial component in attaining the lowest cutting force, flank wear, and surface roughness responses. The results obtained using the artificial gorilla optimization algorithm and the dingo optimization algorithm are found to be more precise than those obtained using the RSM-designed experimentation of dry turning operations, as cutting force, surface roughness, and flank wear have been minimized by utilizing the factor settings achieved using both the artificial gorilla optimization algorithm and the dingo optimization algorithm.","['Engineering', 'Materials Engineering', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Structural Materials', 'Biomaterials']"

Construction installations account for approximately 36% of total energy consumption and consume on average 25% more energy due to inefficiency. There is a large unused potential of energy management systems, which can potentially achieve 20–30 PJ final savings through application in non-residential construction already in a small country like the Netherlands. A good design is important but also maintaining performance and condition in operation over the years. Most buildings have many problems with comfort and indoor air quality. The maintenance of the installations is more action oriented than performance oriented, which means that the costs are higher and the number of malfunctions and nuisances for the user higher. Therefore, it is important to detect deviations as soon as possible with continuous commissioning, so that there is constant monitoring of all circumstances and error detection in combination with a diagnosis. The European Commission has adopted the revised European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD III) with the aim of improving the energy efficiency of buildings, thereby reducing energy consumption. The directive was implemented in Dutch laws and regulations on March 10, 2020. The EPBD III prescribes system requirements for improving the energy performance of technical building systems. The current building management systems cannot comply with this. Data is produced and (sometimes) shown in graphs, but analysis thereof is missing and is not automated; interfaces to inform and support the administrator in his decisions are very limited. The energy transition requires more optimally functioning installations that use less energy. Users want healthier and more productive climate conditions. The complexity of the installations increases sharply and therefore the necessary experience and knowledge to solve problems. There is a growing shortage of experienced people who are able to analyse this data. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to develop systems to automate these continuous monitoring, error detection and diagnostic functions. It is important to improve and safeguard the methods for data analysis and control related to GBS and measurement and control systems of installations and to develop suitable algorithms based on big data analytics and machine learning.","['Energy', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management']"

It is known that infragravity wave propagation into these estuaries can induce strong currents and that closures lead to stagnating flows and declining water quality; however, how the estuarine circulation (tidal and subtidal) dynamically drives and responds to these conditions remains largely unknown. Here we analyze over 4 years of hydrodynamic observations in Los Peñasquitos Lagoon, a low-inflow, intermittently closed estuary in Southern California, to examine wave propagation into the estuary, sill accretion, and the estuarine circulation response over tidal, fortnightly, seasonal, and interannual time scales, providing an unprecedented view as to how these systems respond to changing forcing. Wave observations near the estuary inlet show that wave energy inside the inlet, which contributes to sill accretion, is dependent on water level relative to the sill height and has a tidal variation due to wave-current interactions. Tidal phase averages of conditions during open, pre-closure, spring, neap, and closed conditions highlight the large dynamic range that these estuaries experience. During open, low sill conditions, circulation and stratification are consistent with stratification-induced periodic straining and subtidal exchange varies with the fortnightly cycle as observed in many classical estuaries. However, as the sill grows, tidal circulation weakens and becomes strongly sheared and the subtidal exchange no longer scales with a classical theoretical pressure-friction balance.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Freshwater & Marine Ecology', 'Environmental Management', 'Coastal Sciences', 'Water and Health']"

In particular, along the standard Proctor compaction curve, the expansive soil compacted at water content less than the optimum water content has relatively larger macropores in comparison to the expansive soil compacted at water contents greater than the optimum water content. These changes in microstructure not only influence the hydraulic conductivity but also the infiltration rates during the swelling process of compacted expansive soils. Therefore, this paper brings out the effect of remoulding water content on the infiltration rates during swelling process and hydraulic conductivity at the end of swelling process of a compacted expansive soil. The oedometric-infiltrometer test arrangement was used to determine the hydraulic response, in terms of infiltration rates and hydraulic conductivity, upon inundation of the compacted expansive soil specimens remoulded with water contents corresponding to dry and wet side of optimum water contents at the same standard Proctor compaction dry density. As expected at the end of swelling process, the swell magnitude and hydraulic conductivity were relatively higher for the clay specimen compacted at dry of optimum water content. In addition, the infiltration test results showed that the time needed for the outflow (i.e. permeation flow) to occur and attain a steady state condition was comparatively less for the compacted clay specimen compacted at dry of optimum water content than at wet side of optimum water content. The changes in dry density and water content during the swelling process of compacted clay specimens were also traced.","['Engineering', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Building Materials', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences']"

The results show that the most significant impact comes from the production of titanium sheet metal, wood, bricks, and the transport of raw materials. The results suggest that hemp bricks are a sustainable alternative, but they need to be combined with the right manufacturing and transportation processes. This research offers insights into how to introduce sustainability in the building sector through early design decisions, such as the selection of materials.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Computer-Aided Engineering (CAD, CAE) and Design']"

Green Electoral Success and the European Green Deal,OriginalPaper,"In the wake of the 2019 European elections, journalists proclaimed that a “Green Wave” had swept over Europe: The Greens/EFA political group considerably augmented its number of European Parliament (EP) seats, making it the fourth-largest EP political group. This chapter traces the electoral evolution of the European Green parties that are part of the Greens/EFA political group, showing that since their first participation in European elections in 1999 they steadily increased their share of EP seats. It also investigates whether—conjointly with the Greens’ rise—other European political parties equally embraced environmental topics in their 2019 electoral manifestos. This is followed by an exploration of the Greens/EFA’s role and possible influence on the von der Leyen Commission’s priorities with a focus on the European Green Deal. The analysis focuses on the period between the nomination and election of Ursula von der Leyen as European Commission President.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Legislative and Executive Politics']"

These challenges include, but are not limited to, their ongoing involvement with legal systems of international protection, their tenuous immigration status and associated stresses, a lack of support in destination countries, and separation from family members. These experiences, the absence of guaranteed government protections due to selective and hostile asylum regimes in Western countries, and the exclusion of this population from welfare systems result in their precarious legal status. Asylum regulations in a receiving country can impact asylum seekers’ access to essential support and services. Furthermore, experiences of trauma and loss, and liminality caused by protracted application processes, affect the mental health and the well-being of asylum seekers. Because of asylum seekers’ unique challenges and experiences, practitioners require specialized knowledge and skills to support them effectively. This chapter will provide an overview of asylum processes and policies, using the US and European countries as examples. This chapter will also explore these governments’ current responses, common challenges and needs of asylum seekers living in these countries, and best practices and specialized skill social workers who need to support these populations in an integrative way.","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Public Policy', 'Ethics and Values in Social Work']"

We are currently facing a global energy crisis with an unprecedented rise in the price of oil, electricity, and gas. The correct substantiation of the portfolio framework contracts concluded between producers, suppliers, and energy consumers is an essential condition from a financial point of view regarding transactions. They must provide a benefit to the producers, within reasonable limits, so that the consumer price is not artificially increased. This process becomes optimal if a forecast based on artificial intelligence-AI is used, assuming the recently recorded consumption is mediated annually. In the case of the EU countries, it must reflect both the domestic consumption and international trade to be achieved. The forecast must be made in the form of load curves with hourly levels for each day of the selected period. The adopted solution uses a hybrid model, optimized statistically, with neuronal networks, built based on selected preliminary data. The modeling used in the daily task schedules is presented, using self-organizing processes with Kohonen type neural networks. AI and Fuzzy logic is used in estimating energy consumption for a different scenario of average daily and monthly consumption. The results obtained by forecasting are compared with the values recorded in the months selected as a model. The errors obtained are in the range of 2.8–5.1%, validating the elaborated model.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Computational Intelligence']"

Though 71% area of the earth is covered by water, only 0.3% is usable by humans, which makes it more precious than any other substance. Not only for drinking but also for agriculture, fisheries, and all other sectors, quality of water is essential. However, for the past few years, the quality of usable water has been decreasing at an alarming rate, so it has become a vital issue to monitor and analyze the water quality of our surroundings to avoid a catastrophic disaster. This paper proposes an IoT-based water pollution monitoring system that provides a comparison and reports about water quality and pollution using different parameters. The system inputs the temperature, pH, and turbidity from the water using sensors and stores the value in a cloud database with a microcontroller. Then, after processing those data from the cloud and comparing them with the standard value, quality and pollution rate can be monitored with any internet-connected device such as a smartphone or laptop. As an IoT-based system, it is quite cost-effective and an easy-to-use method. So, the proposed system can be significantly beneficial to our society.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence']"

However, the situation was contradictory in IBIs, and the situation remained in a state of paradox, resulting in a severe shortage of qualified talent. Despite this, the number of graduates from Islamic banking education institutions and the number of graduates from Islamic banking institutions continues to grow year after year. As a result, who should be held accountable for this state of affairs in the talent pool? In order to determine the factors that were affecting the talent shortage in Malaysian Islamic banking institutions, the purpose of this study is to collect data from a variety of sources. Using a quantitative approach, which includes exploration, description, and explanatory characteristic, the researcher has sent out questionnaires to 380 students in Malaysian public universities. Structural equation modelling used to analyse the data gathered from the questionnaires with IBM-SPSS and IBM-AMOS software to generate the results. Consequently, the curriculum variable was found to have a dominant effect on the supply of available talent. The implications this research has contributed to the economic and societal expansion as the model for talent development able to assist in reduce the talent gap between supply and demand.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

More specifically, it questions the consequences of cumulative EU institutional and political changes on the Presidency and the General Secretariat of the Council. What are the adjustments between the administrative sphere (the Secretariat) and the political sphere (the Council)? Which actor(s) set(s) the tone after decades of changes? Which role(s) do(es) the Secretariat play, and how has it evolved? The analysis shows that national administrations have experienced a progressive loss of grip on the ‘presidential routine’, thus creating new windows of opportunities for the Secretariat. The latter moved away from being a Council’s instrument with purely technical tasks to become an influential political advisor to the Presidency. By gradually institutionalising its own routines and informal rules, the Council’s administration empowered itself. As a result, today’s General Secretariat exerts an influence on the Presidency that goes beyond its traditional coordinating and supportive roles. Bureaucratic ascendancy over the political sphere is, however, not observed. Instead, I demonstrate the existence of a symbiotic relationship: through the General Secretariat’s empowerment, the rotating presidency has maintained itself and strengthened its ability to pursue the Council’s interests in interinstitutional negotiations.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Legislative and Executive Politics']"

The aspiration to pursue a patient-centered, holistic approach collides with the need to establish commonly accepted diagnostic criteria for different disturbances in sexual functioning, involving one or multiple phases of the sexual response cycle and pain associated with sexual activity. According to recently proposed classifications, which are continuously evolving, the most relevant FSDs include hypoactive sexual desire disorder, female arousal disorder, persistent genital arousal disorder, and female orgasm disorder. The present chapter aims to provide a clinical perspective on these disorders by reviewing the most recent evidence on the pathophysiology, definitions, prevalence, leading etiologies, diagnostic tools, and key therapeutic approaches. Sexual pain-related conditions will be reviewed in another chapter. It is evident that a gender bias still exists, with prominent biological etiologies of FSDs being neglected and understudied at the expense of psychodynamic and relational determinants. Moreover, classifications should serve to advocate the advancement of our knowledge of female sexual functioning.

Global climate change has been attributed primarily to carbon dioxide emissions. In this context, carbon emission monitoring has been recognized through reference to carbon mitigation strategies and policies at different levels (product, organization, city, and national). Consequently, researchers have begun calculating global carbon emissions based on this increasing attention. It has been found that avoiding high amounts of CO 2 emission from construction will probably reduce the overall CO 2 emission. We have investigated the utilization of zeolite as a substitute for cement that will consequently absorb CO 2 . This will reduce the amount of CO 2 in the environment without hampering the characteristic properties of concrete.

Thus, only from the systems considered there is a need to remove the heat flow to the environment in automotive and tractor equipment with a power of 70 … 100% of the effective engine power. The efficiency of the block cooling system is largely determined by the temperature-dynamic properties, which establish a pattern between external environmental factors and the temperature regime of the functional systems. Radiators of automotive equipment are made, as a rule, from non-ferrous metals (copper, aluminum, zinc), the cost of which is constantly increasing and the search for new materials for radiators remains an urgent task. Its solution can be found in the use of plastics, such as polyurethane, which is increasingly being used by manufacturers of automotive equipment.

The reasons that do not allow using the existing methods of assessing transport accessibility in relation to the areas of the Arctic zone were identified. Statistical methods such as transport network density per 1000 square kilometers of territory, per 1000 inhabitants; Engel, Goltz, Uspensky, Vasilevsky coefficients; methods of topological analysis of transport networks; methods of spatial analysis and delimitation of transport networks; methods of potentials and balance methods have been considered as existing methods of transport accessibility assessment. Based on the analysis of the state of networks of different types of transport and the survey of the local population, the main reasons that limit transport accessibility of these territories have been identified. These reasons include: the lack of railway service, the lack of roads for year-round use, the high cost of passenger intra-regional air transportation, the low regularity of flights, and the limited regular route network of existing airlines. Taking into account these factors, the paper proposes a methodology for assessing the transport accessibility of the regions of the Arctic zone in terms of the organization of passenger transportation, which is based on the calculation of the full cost of all correspondence from a particular area to all other considered areas of the region per 1 km of distance between them. The full cost of transportation is calculated as the direct costs of purchasing tickets for transportation, the cost of waiting time for connecting flights, and the waiting time for flight delays due to weather conditions. The cost of waiting time is estimated based on the calculation of the average cost of accommodation for one day in Yakutsk.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer']"

The cloud-ERP systems provide many opportunities to organizations. On the other hand, barriers, and challenges to this move still exist. This research provides an overview of relevant academic literature on public cloud-ERP migration and identifies the status quo for the body of knowledge within cloud-ERPs delivered through software-as-a-service (SaaS). In addition, this paper explores the motivators and inhibitors, and if cloud-ERP provides the ability to enhance organizational performance from an IT perspective. The study is motivated by a gap in research in investigating if cloud-ERP systems’ characteristics encourage or hinder enterprises from migrating to the public cloud. Cloud-ERPs delivered in SaaS models are distributed as a service over the Internet, usually through a public cloud infrastructure with shared resources. SaaS enables organizations to pay for services and functions they use and removes the need to maintain the complex information technology infrastructure by client organizations. The cloud-ERP-system’s characteristics found in the literature are organized, and presented based on DeLone, and McLean’s IS success model dimensions, and the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework. Our main findings suggest that cloud-ERP’s system and service quality are the most discussed issues in the literature. The system quality attributes of cloud-ERPs identified are scalability, availability, accessibility, reliability, and the ability to compose and customize web services, motivating organizations to adopt cloud-based ERP. On the other hand, service quality attributes are found as inhibitors for moving to the cloud due to the organization´s dependency on vendors´ support and service throughout the product lifecycle, and the security risks related to the public cloud environment.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In doing so, they should protect the surrounding area and use only a small amount of resources. To this end, the following requirements must be taken into account in planning: they should connect the origin-destination traffic as directly as possible, they should allow an average car speed Speeds appropriate to regional planning, they should have sufficient traffic quality Traffic quality on all sections of the route they should be safe to use for all modes of transport, they should be produced and operated at the lowest possible costs, wherever possible, they should have separate traffic areas Traffic areas for motor vehicle traffic and non-motorised and agricultural traffic, they should have consistent route characteristics, i.e. alignment Alignment and cross-section should be coordinated and not change fundamentally on longer lines, they should adapt well to the terrain and local constraints, if possible, they should not take up valuable land, they should not impair settlement and spatial development, they should be kept as far away as possible from environmentally sensitive areas and they should minimize noise and pollutant emissions and their propagation by appropriate alignment Alignment . The multi-layered effects of rural roads require a balance that takes into account not only the objectives of safe and functional traffic flow Traffic flows but also the protection of natural resources, the limited resources and the effects on settlement areas and urban design. The basis for the consideration on different stages of planning is usually formed by several design variants. The most advantageous variant can be worked out by weighing up the target areas of traffic quality Traffic quality , traffic safety, environment and costs. In addition to line planning, further technical contributions are required for consideration. These are, in particular, traffic studies, which present the basic requirements and the effects on traffic, and environmental studies such as environmental impact studies or FFH impact assessments (FFH = Flora-Fauna-Habitat). In addition, urban development, calculations of immissions or economic feasibility studies are often required.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Materials Engineering']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-15211-5_26,en,A Literature Review of a Dual-Purpose Solar Collector,OriginalPaper,"Solar energy is an abundance, inexpensive and clean source of energy. Using this energy source can be widely spread as the efficiency of solar systems improves. The main component of any solar thermal system is the solar collector which absorbs the incident solar radiation and converts it into heat. Solar thermal systems are categorised into two major types as air and liquid heaters. A solar air heater (SAH) is used for space heating and crop drying. A solar water heater (SWH) is used to supply hot water for domestic and industrial applications. However, air and liquid collectors are considered as a single purpose collector since the working fluid is air or liquid only. One way to enhance the performance of solar thermal systems is by combining both air and liquid heaters in one facility called dual-purpose solar collector (DPSC). This collector is basically a flat plate solar collector (FPSC) with two sections, one for air heating and the other for water heating. Therefore, it can produce hot air and hot water simultaneously. Using DPSC can attain high temperature, and high thermal performance with a reduction in cost and space. Despite many significant investigations on DPSC, no review paper has been seen. This article presents the different designs and applications of DPSC and the parameters affecting its performance. A comparison between single and dual-purpose solar collectors is also discussed. Moreover, the possibility of integrating DPSC in some automobile manufacturing processes is suggested in this article as well.","['Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering']"

In the second part, I offer a textual study of democracy as it appears in Discourses , unpicking some of the nuances and rationale behind Sidney’s own anti-democratic statements. Thirdly, I reconstruct the broader framework of Sidney’s republicanism to suggest, despite major tensions, how Discourses does incline to democratic power and democracy, even in Sidney’s own words. Finally, however, I demonstrate significant and insidious exclusionary dimensions to Sidney’s politics.

Usually, the stator supports are assumed to be symmetric, however, in some conditions, the stator support stiffness is anisotropic in nature. In this paper, an approximate analytical solution for the rub interactions between a Jeffcott rotor and an asymmetrically supported stator is introduced. The present problem is a good example of piecewise nonlinear dynamics in which contact causes the system to switch between linear and nonlinear dynamic behavior. To evaluate an analytical solution to the contact equations, Taylor’s expansion is used to linearize the contact forces. Then, an analytical solution is introduced based on this approximation. To investigate the validity of the present model, the proposed approximate analytical solution is compared with the numerical solution obtained using direct numerical integration for the same problem. The results show that the proposed piecewise analytical solution is efficient in evaluating the system response for both periodic and chaotic responses.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis']"

We consider the psychological safety of students with health limitations and disabilities as a special state of mind, characterized by adequate perception and assessment of the degree of danger of the educational environment of the university, formed in the process of conscious self-image as a future professional, the accumulation of experience in overcoming problematic situations of professionalization. Resilience is singled out as the most significant factor in the development of psychological safety. It is analyzed as the ability to survive important stages of obtaining higher professional education without violating the main indicators of the disease, while maintaining internal mental and social balance and signs of working capacity.. The dynamics of the development of these indicators at the mental and psychological levels allows us to draw a conclusion about the logic of the formation of resilience, which ensures the formation of the psychological safety of students with health limitations and disabilities.

These layers’ presence alters saturation and pore pressure distribution, in turn affecting soil strength. The quantification of their impact on failure triggering and subsequent propagation is often missing in current studies. This work investigates the problem with a recently developed Material Point Method (MPM) formulation for unsaturated soils, which can simulate slope failure from initiation to the entire collapse dynamics. A simple geometry accounting for the presence of a weak layer is considered, and two saturation “paths” are tested. One path reflects the effect of rainfall on the slope; the other mimics the rising of the water table induced by an upstream recharge. The evolution of failure captured by the MPM highlights several stages in the post-failure behavior, with initial motion which leads to an apparent dormant phase, followed by a significant reactivation. It is possible to fully quantify the soil masses in motion, thus allowing for a comparison between the two saturation paths effects. Lastly, the same analysis is carried out with the Limit Equilibrium Method (LEM). The critical review of the results allows for understanding the limitations of the technique in capturing the complex phenomenon under analysis, and the advantages introduced by the unsaturated MPM.","['Engineering', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Offshore Engineering']"

Global shocks (e.g., war, economic recession, pandemic) can severely disrupt these interconnections and generate cascading consequences across local to global scales. To comprehensively evaluate these consequences, it is crucial to use integrated frameworks that consider multiple interconnections and flows among coupled human and natural systems. Here we use the framework of metacoupling (human–nature interactions within as well as across adjacent and distant systems) to illustrate the effects of major global shocks on the evolution of global interconnectedness between the early 1900s and the 2010s.

Therefore, monitoring and tracking of the arrival times and path of the tropical cyclones are extremely valuable in providing early warning to the public and governments. Hurricane Florence struck the East cost of USA in 2018 and offers an outstanding case study. We employed Global Positioning System (GPS) derived precipitable water vapor (PWV) data to track and investigate the characteristics of storm occurrences in their spatial and temporal distribution using a dense ground network of permanent GPS stations. Our findings indicate that a rise in GPS-derived PWV occurred several hours before Florence’s manifestation. Also, we compared the temporal distribution of the GPS-derived PWV content with the precipitation value for days when the storm appeared in the area under influence. The study will contribute to quantitative assessment of the complementary GPS tropospheric products in hurricane monitoring and tracking using GPS-derived water vapor evolution from a dense network of permanent GPS stations.","['Earth Sciences', 'Geophysics/Geodesy', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Remote Sensing/Photogrammetry']"

In this paper, a test structure exhibiting geometric nonlinearity is experimentally studied, and the same is modeled using finite element method (FEM). A study of various parameters involved during the modeling processes such as any assumed parameters and boundary conditions is thoroughly reviewed. The deficiencies of linear model updating processes are highlighted, and suitable workarounds that provide more meaningful and well correlating models for nonlinear dynamic systems are discussed in this paper.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Automotive Engineering']"

A framework of police legitimacy and self-legitimacy is used to investigate the interactions between AFOs and a public that is unused to seeing armed police. Drawing from over 200 h of ethnographic material gathered whilst observing officers on duty in ARVs across two English police forces, this chapter documents real-life interactions between the public and AFOs. No evidence of a visceral, negative public reaction to armed police is found. However, the on-call ARV model is seen by AFOs as impairing their ability to perform legitimate policing by distancing them from the public. Having the opportunity to interact with the public is affirmatory for AFOs and forms a critical part of their self-legitimacy.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Crime and Society', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Public Health']"

Meanwhile, existing studies on privacy policies only focused on specific areas of interest and lack an inclusive outlook on the state privacy policies due to the differences in privacy policy samples, text properties, measures, methodologies, and backgrounds. Therefore, this research develops an assessment metric to bridge this gap by integrating the fragmented understanding of privacy policies and exploring potential aspects to evaluate privacy policies absent from existing studies. The multifaceted assessment metric developed through this study covers three main aspects: content, text property, and user interface. Through the investigation and analyses performed on Malaysian organizations’ online privacy policies, this study reveals several trends using text processing and clustering analysis methods: (1) the use of jargon in privacy policies are relatively low, (2) privacy policies with higher compliance levels tend to be lengthier and more repetitive, and vice versa, (3) regardless of compliance level, there are privacy policies that are not presented in user-friendly font size.

The paper aims at checking the opportunities for PV integration in heritage buildings. The study is applied to the “Rustico Macchi”, an Italian heritage building that need a complete retrofit for hosting exhibitions and didactic activities. To do so, a dynamic building energy model (BES) is created considering the data from on-site tests. This model is tested adding various types of PV modules on roof, façade, or windows, and integration levels, checking, for each case, the reduction of non-renewable input primary energy and self-consumed electrical energy produced by PV.

Urban residential buildings are a considerable subsector of construction industry, and this chapter focuses on the energy consumption potentials resulting from various design factors of external horizontal louvers for this building type. For this purpose, a typical four-story apartment building with a north-south orientation in city of Rasht – located in Csa zone based on Koppen classification – has been selected as a case study. Several design scenarios are created varying shading factors as windows coverage percentage, louvers distancing, tilt, and width. The southern façade as the most influenced building face by solar gain is the subject of study. The analysis of device alternatives is conducted using Design Builder energy simulation software, aiming to minimize the heating, cooling, and lighting energy consumption.

To extract useful information from huge data, data analysis is required. For analysis, data has to be shared with a third party called data analyst. Sharing data with data analyst introduces the risk of privacy for individuals whose sensitive information is present in the shared data. Privacy is the right of an individual, so it needs to be maintained while sharing the data with a third party. There are many privacy-preserving algorithms available. k-anonymization is one of the most popular and traditional privacy-preserving methods. It modifies data to protect an individual's sensitive information by disconnecting the link between an individual and its sensitive information. k-anonymization uses generalization and suppression tools to anonymize the data. Generalization replaces specific values of attributes with general values, and suppression deletes unmatched values of attributes. There are many existing single table anonymization algorithms. The proposed work presents how a single table anonymization algorithm can be applied on multi-relation dataset. It also discusses the problems encountered when single table anonymization algorithms are used for the multi-relation dataset. Present work also discusses the limitations of k-anonymization and gives future research directions.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Statistics, general', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The as-cast AZ31 has a lesser hardness, corrosion, and wear resistance. However, work hardening techniques refine the microstructure of AZ31 alloy with a uniform dispersion of β phase particles and hence improve the desirable properties. In this study, the as-cast AZ31 alloy is hot-rolled at different temperatures (150, 300, and 400 °C). The influence of rolling temperature on the microstructural evolution, microhardness, wear rate, and corrosion rate of specimens is analyzed. The instrumental characterization (FE-SEM, HR-TEM, and SE) is performed to deduce the kinetics of microstructural evolution, wear mechanism, and corrosion mechanism. The optimum hot rolling temperature for AZ31 alloy is inferred from the results.

For example, Adam Smith, Henry Sidgwick, and John Rawls, variously argue that a person acting in her own self-interest should have a more-or-less neutral attitude to time. Consequently, she should see her future self as having the same importance as her present self and behave accordingly. The choices she makes are therefore based on what might be called ‘holistic prudence’. So, her choices are informed by her ‘stepping-back’ from her presently orientated subjective viewpoint. She then takes an objective stock of her life led as a whole, while also being open to advice and correction regarding her present desires and orientations. However, there are notorious problems with this liberal view which are examined here, via what is called, The Ontology of Well-Being Thesis (TOWT). The main argument is that these problems can be addressed by focussing on the shared ontological features of the human condition identified and explored in Chap. 2 and underpinning TOWT. Specifically, our conflicting experiences of time are examined, which Derek Parfit also explores in his seminal book, Reasons and persons ( 1987 ). The argument is that the classical liberal view of self-interest, and correspondingly temporal neutrality and ‘objectivity’, usefully explains individual attitudes regarding future-plans. It does not, though, recognise other ontological biases we have toward the present and near-future, over the past and distant-future, which, for Parfit, are difficult to deny. It is these biases which profoundly affect how aspects of social policy and welfare practices are understood and promoted, notably concerning state-governed pensions policy.","['Philosophy', 'Political Philosophy', 'Employee Health and Wellbeing', 'Social Policy', 'Politics of the Welfare State', 'Social Work and Community Development', 'Comparative Social Policy']"

In India, agrarian distress has been manifested in the form of farmers’ suicide for the past 20 years. Agrarian distress in the farm household is resulting in deteriorated living standards, challenges in getting a quality education, forced migration, unmanageable health expenses, and poor nutrition level. In this regard, financial analysis is an effective method to identify the severity of the agrarian distress in the farm households (FHH). In this study, a financial analysis of 150 FHHs from Yavatmal district (being India’s most agrarian distressed area) has been conducted for three consecutive years from 2016–17, 2017–18, and 2018–19. After preparing financial statements and computing financial performance measures, FHHs have been categorized into five groups (i) FHHs not earning profit from the farm, (ii) FHHs not able to save money at the end of the year, (iii) FHHs putting their asset in risk, (iv) FHHs not able to repay the loan, and (v) FHHs not able to earn sufficient from farm to fulfill their HH expenditure. It has been observed that 22%, 16%, and 14% of the sampled FHHs, respectively in the year 2016–17, 2017–18, and 2018–19 earned sufficient from their farm to fulfill their domestic expenditure (category v). Thus, it was found that year on year the percentage of farmers able to meet their household expenditure was decreasing which could be of help to policymakers in deciding the remedies to improve the financial status of the distressed FHHs.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes']"

Academic literature on effective treatment approaches for justice-involved young people supports a focus on therapeutic, tailored approaches that build and strengthen positive youth development, social support networks, and commitment to school or work. By establishing the design implications which follow from this evidence, a series of key characteristics emerge that define a best-practice, theoretical facility model: small-scale, locally sited, and integrated with the surrounding community, designed to promote relational and differentiated security, and comprising therapeutic design characteristics. We explored each of the characteristics in three well-regarded European jurisdictions: Spain, Norway, and the Netherlands. Our observations substantiate the theoretical facility model as a valuable tool for drawing into view the tensions, opportunities, strengths, and weaknesses of a design, relative to the facility’s given context. Our findings highlight the importance of carefully considering the design of youth justice facilities in terms of the desired outcomes as they greatly impact upon procedures and ways of working within these facilities, and ultimately impact the outcomes for young people and the community.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

While most morphing airfoils are controlled using actuators, the passive morphing airfoil deforms due to the balance between the airfoil surface’s static pressure and the model flexibility. In our previous study, the designed morphing airfoil model had an interesting characteristic. As lift force increased, the camber of the airfoil increased and a higher lift was achieved. Meanwhile, the internal structure of the model was complex; thus, 24% thickness airfoil (NACA0024) had to be used, and maintaining a model-manufacturing accuracy was difficult. Considering adaptation to aircraft, it is necessary to study thinner airfoils in terms of aerodynamic performance and to manufacture models more accurately. Therefore, a new passive morphing airfoil model was manufactured based on NACA0012. The internal structure was simplified to realize thickness reduction and high model-manufacturing accuracy. The deformation and aerodynamic characteristics were measured through low-speed wind tunnel experiments. Two deformation characteristics, (1) decreasing of the effective angle-of-attack (AOA) and (2) increasing of the camber, were observed. In addition, the deformation gradually increased as the AOA increased. The maximum lift coefficient increased by 13% compared with the rigid airfoil. Further, the lift coefficient of the passive airfoil tailed off slower than the rigid airfoil at a stall angle.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

In traditional step-up converter like, transformerless converters using switched capacitor, switched inductor, etc., maximum voltage gain is not satisfied our expectations because of maximum duty cycle (i.e. duty cycle closely one). Switches are facing severe problem in reverse recovery, high on-state losses, high electromagnetic interference (EMI), etc., when they are operating at extreme duty cycle. Generally, grids are interconnected with AC supply from various power stations. But increase in solar energy demands the use of grid for DC supply. Nowadays, DC micro-grid is having higher attention due to rise in load requirement in DC and betterment in power quality. Based on power rating, these DC loads need various output voltages. In DC micro-grid, photovoltaic source (PV) is the best source of energy. The purpose of non-isolated converters is low cost and high reliability. A high-gain converter with PWM control is an essential for DC micro-grid due to very minimum voltage from photovoltaic. To achieve this, a boost DC–DC PWM converter configuration is discussed that exhibits a maximum voltage gain behaviour and the switches are controlled by a single control signal, which simplifies the operation. The new converter functions in uninterrupted output current mode.","['Energy', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Environmental Policy', 'Sociology, general']"

This study would specifically investigate the effects of the developed designs on wind pressure and velocity conditions at the diffusers' inlet and outlet areas. Using the SOLIDWORKS application, two design concepts were created: single-layered and double-layered. The first concept used a single cone-shaped structured diffuser, whereas the second concept used a cone-shaped structure but with a smaller cone-shaped structure placed inside the first structure. To determine the pressure and velocity variations along the diffuser’s inlet and outlet areas, these concepts were simulated using the ANSYS Fluent® application. The results strongly favored the double shrouded design of Concept 2 in both velocity and pressure simulations, with a velocity increment of 102% and a drag force of −0.161 N. The actual test results also show promising data that would make the prototype feasible for use in an urban area, with an average efficiency of 40% and a high efficiency compared to other urban-built wind turbines.","['Engineering', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation']"

Besides improving HbA 1c and reducing body weight and blood pressure, the SGLT2 inhibitors have also been demonstrated to improve cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, an effect largely independent of their effect on blood glucose levels. Indeed, the mechanisms underlying these benefits remain elusive. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors has been found to modestly increase systemic ketone levels. Ketone bodies are an ancillary fuel source substituting for glucose in some tissues and may also possess intrinsic anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. Some have proposed that ketones may in fact mediate the cardio-renal benefits of this drug category. However, a rare complication of SGLT2 inhibition is ketoacidosis, sometimes with normal or near-normal blood glucose concentrations, albeit occurring more frequently in patients with type 1 diabetes who are treated (predominately off-label) with one of these agents. We herein explore the notion that an underpinning of one of the more serious adverse effects of SGLT2 inhibitors may, in fact, explain, at least in part, some of their benefits—a potential ‘double-edged sword’ of this novel drug category.

However, the access to modern technologies is not available to all nations on an equitable basis; hence, the categorization between the developed, developing and least developed countries. Technology Transfer has been a controversial issue under the Intellectual Property regime for years now, as without technological innovation and advancement in that sphere, no country can survive with dignity in the modern period. In fact, due to such disparities, the developed countries tend to become more developed, and the least developed tend to go further down the surface, towards regression. But is the “transfer” a matter of concern only amongst countries? Is there no such disparity “within” the nations themselves? Are all the resources equitably divided within the geographical divisions of each nation? These questions often come up, especially when we think of a country as vast and diverse as India. With this paper, the authors seek to highlight the loopholes in the Indian law with regard to technology transfer generally as well as specifically in one of the most important sectors of its economy, i.e., the agricultural sector.

This type of robot stands out for its extraordinary ability to move within unstructured environments, overcome obstacles and adapt to different terrains. However, quadruped robots have gained space in the SAR-Tasks field over the last few years. Most implementations are limited to collecting information using different sensors, such as cameras, lasers, or microphones. This article seeks to simulate, implement and carry out the teleoperation through Mixed-Reality (M-R) of a quadruped robot equipped with a manipulator with six degrees of freedom, for which the ARTU-R robot (A1 Rescue Tasks Unitree Robot) has been used. One of the main contributions of this work focuses on improving the efficiency in executing tasks of handling and transporting medical equipment in post-disaster situations, using Mixed Reality with the ARTU-R robot and a robotic manipulator. To develop this proof of concept, Matlab has been used as a computational tool for optimizing the workspace of the integrated robot. Simulations have been carried out on Gazebo in reconstructed post-disaster environments to validate the robot’s functionality. At the same time, the effectiveness of the M-R system has been verified with field tests executing medical assistance tasks with the robot.

Therefore, satellite remote sensing data and process-based terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) are used in this study to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of WUE over the TP from 2001 to 2010. Then, the effects of land use and land cover change (LULCC) and CO 2 fertilization on WUE from 1981–2010 are assessed using TBMs. Results show that climate change is the leading contributor to the change in WUE on the TP, and temperature is the most important factor. LULCC makes a negative contribution to WUE (−20.63%), which is greater than the positive contribution of CO 2 fertilization (11.65%). In addition, CO 2 fertilization can effectively improve ecosystem resilience on the TP. On the northwest plateau, the effects of LULCC and CO 2 fertilization on WUE are more pronounced during the driest years than the annual average.

This is evidenced by the industrial practice of interconnect capacitance extraction during the design of high-performance very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits. In this chapter, the FRW algorithm is enhanced through the distributed parallel computing. With an efficient and adaptive task allocation scheme, the communication among different computer nodes is largely reduced. A distributed algorithm for accelerating the space management is also proposed. They have been implemented with message passing interface (MPI) and applied to the high-precision capacitance simulation for touchscreen design, along with the interconnect capacitance extraction of VLSI circuits. In addition, the techniques to enhance the reproducibility of the parallel FRW algorithm are presented, which ensure that same result is reproduced while rerunning the parallel FRW solver with same settings. Experiments on a computer cluster show that the proposed techniques achieve up to 114X speedup while using 120 cores, and build up the space management structure for a VLSI case including two million conductor blocks in just 22 s (37X parallel speedup on 60 cores).

However, little is known about the early evolution of these systems, as few studies on the brain of early reptiles exist. Old accounts consider parts of the brain based on the anatomical analysis of the braincase, but they do not include several brain regions and rarely consider it in a broader evolutionary scenario. Likewise, recent approaches remain rare and superficial, focusing in comparative analysis of other, late-diverging groups. Computed tomography scanning has been widely used to assess the paleoneurology of fossils, but such studies are still largely missing for early reptiles. Here, the morphological diversity of the encephalon and sensory systems of early reptiles is revised, and areas of potential interest are indicated for future research. The scarce data seems to corroborate a stepwise adaptation to terrestrial habitats, but subsequent back-to-water transitions remain poorly understood. Without proper information on early reptiles, our understanding of the paleobiology of these groups is weak, hampering our comprehension on the flourishing of reptile diversity.","['Life Sciences', 'Evolutionary Biology', 'Paleontology', 'Vertebrates', 'Animal Anatomy / Morphology / Histology']"

Placental pathologies and preterm delivery closely correlate with the size and shape of the placenta. Additionally, normal vaginal microbiota is disturbed during viral insults such as SARS-CoV-2 and HIV, with consequent placental anomalies. This chapter focuses on placental development, morphology, and pathology while also investigating placental bed structure and function. Placental anomalies with regard to HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection and placental morphometric image analysis and its relevance for verification of placental pathology are explored. Since image analysis remains optional for routine diagnostic purposes, authentication of placental appraisal warrants the use of measurable predefined definitions. Immunohistochemical analyses of placental morphology and angiogenic, epithelial, and apoptotic mechanisms facilitate research into etiopathogenetic pathways involved in placental anomalies with a focus on discovering novel diagnostic foci. Thus, image analyses as an adjunct to complement pathological investigations are recommended.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Anatomy', 'Medical Education', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Visualization', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Computers and Education']"

The growing body of evidence linking the gut microbiome to host metabolism has been accompanied by change in the study of metabolic illnesses including type 2 diabetes. Disturbance in the balance of gut microbiome “gut dysbiosis” has led to the emergence of the concept of “leaky gut” and metabolic endotoxemia. Previous studies observed higher lipopolysaccharide or lipopolysaccharide binding protein concentrations in diabetics than in healthy controls. Translocation of bacteria and their products through the disrupted gut barrier increased the circulation of markers that could be linked to increased intestinal permeability. The end result of translocated products is the stimulation of systemic inflammatory response affecting many organs and increasing insulin resistance thus aggravating diabetes. It is anticipated that by gaining a better understanding of the mechanism of leaky gut and bacterial translocation in diabetes, scientists will be able to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","['Biomedicine', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Pharmacology/Toxicology']"

Operators work with what they have unless they can convince elected officials to allocate additional resources. However, all involved can attempt to procure and operate facilities in a manner that mitigates negative outcomes for everyone who becomes justice system involved. Reducing the potential for abuse and violence—inmate-on-inmate, inmate-on-staff, and staff-on-inmate—and improving conditions of confinement through design and incentivization blunts negative outcomes and potential future misuse. The work does not end after buildings are constructed, and entrenched cultural issues that may negatively impact safe and effective operations must be addressed. Although designers have limited levers to influence organizational culture, their designs can support safe, secure, and constitutional operations via functionality, adequate flows of people and materials, and environments that promote wellness. However, the adoption of inmate supervision paradigms—especially the extent to which administrators commit to full implementation— drives organizational culture, reduced violence, vandalism, suicides, lower levels of inmate stress, and increased officer job satisfaction. These improved outcomes, however, only occur when everyone up the chain of command fully commits to positive organizational culture, and that commitment is sustained.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

Global warming is considered a structural handicap for developed economies as well as developing economies. All the scientists have agreed that global warming can lower the pace of their growth and it can disrupt its financial stability. For some countries, this phenomenon can even worsen their financial instabilities. For these reasons, scientific research has been directed towards very advanced empirical studies linking the climate cycle with the economic cycle and these have been noticed by the development of the Integrated Assessment Models (IAM). This kind of model is considered as a macroeconomic model of climate change but in our case, we introduce this module in the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Model applied for the Tunisian economy. Our paper develops an environmental DSGE (E-DSGE) model whose objective is to try to sensitize political decision-makers as well as Tunisian financial decision-makers, to be more concerned about climate change in their economic policies from an evaluation of the effects of these climatic changes on financial stability in Tunisia.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-11272-0_1,en,Introduction,OriginalPaper,"In recent years, policies that extend the working life have been a key feature of European and other countries with post-industrialised economies. These policies focus on two dimensions of work and retirement which governments consider crucial to reform if pension systems are to be safeguarded in the context of ageing populations. First, legal and administrative reforms are pushing back the legal age of retirement thereby withholding pension rights until workers have reached a certain age. Second, defined benefit pensions, so-called because employees and employers know the formula for calculating retirement benefits in advance of paying them, are being phased out and replaced by defined contribution pensions, where the level of contributions, and not the final benefit, is pre-defined and no final pension promise is made. This shift results in the individualisation of pension benefits, since in most cases workers must build up sufficient contributions and invest in pension products on financial markets. The effect of this trend is that workers remain in the labour force longer in order to secure an acceptable pension benefit. Overall, the implementation of these two policies to extend the working life has produced the desired effect of retaining individuals longer in the labour market and easing the pressure on public pensions, as can be seen in data produced by Eurostat since the 1990s: the proportion of people aged 55 years or more in the total number of persons employed in the EU-27 increased from 12% to 20% between 2004 and 2019 (Eurostat, 2021).","['Social Sciences', 'Life course', 'Labor Economics', 'Aging', 'Social Structure, Social Inequality', 'Sociology of Work']"

In the context of a gradual increase in the political and economic potential of the countries of the East as well as the current geopolitical situation and the actual ‘narrowing’ of the space for foreign policy and foreign economic manoeuvre, the ‘pivot to the East’ has become of particular importance for Russia. At the same time, interaction is of particular value not only at the traditional, bilateral level but also in network cooperation, which can become a ‘multiplier’ of Russia's positions in the above-mentioned regions. Taking into account the increasing trend towards the ‘orientation’ of international relations and the aspirations of the Eastern countries towards taking a more effective and meaningful part in the network system of global governance, the maximum possible diversification of relations with these states based on network types of interaction is the most successful model. The chapter’s main purpose is to identify relevant aspects of Russia's cooperation with the countries of these regions by examining a number of countries as well as their current configuration. Within the chapter, the key issue is the state of Russia's network cooperation in the East as well as opportunities and future prospects for increasing it. For a comprehensive study of this topic, methods of comparative analysis, historical retrospective, particularisation, and generalisation, as well as modelling have been used. As a result, it was discovered that, on the one hand, Russia has significant potential for increasing network interaction in the Middle East and Asia, and on the other, faces a number of difficulties associated with the complicated nature of the network structure of cooperation in these regions. This means that Russia should take into account not only the military–political aspects of cooperation, in whose network formats it is mainly represented but also trade and economic factors that are of particular importance in the current conditions of geopolitical turbulence. One way or another, the ‘pivot to the East’ must be not just a theoretical geopolitical concept, but a real paradigm for the implementation of foreign policy and foreign economic strategy, taking into account the need to engage in mutually beneficial formats of network interaction.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Diplomacy', 'International Relations', 'International Organization']"

Therefore, it is critical to establish a lifting limit for workers. However, it is not practical to obtain each individual’s maximum lifting weight through experiments. The existing simulation models in the literature have only considered static joint strength (joint torque limits). However, during lifting motion all joint torque limits depend on joint angle and their angular velocities, i.e., dynamic strengths. This chapter presents a dynamic-joint-strength-based two-dimensional (2D) symmetric maximum-weight lifting simulation and experimental validation. Dynamic joint strength (the net joint moment capacity) is modeled as a function of joint angle and angular velocity, which is adopted in the optimization formulation to predict the maximum lifting weight and corresponding motion. Lifting experiment was performed for a maximum-weight-box-lifting task in the laboratory, and kinetic and kinematic Kinematic data including lifting motion and ground reaction forces (GRF) were collected using a motion capture system and force plates, respectively. For the subject, the predicted spine, shoulder, elbow, hip, knee, and ankle joint angles, as well as vertical and horizontal GRF and box weight, were compared with the experimental data. The results show that the proposed optimization-based motion prediction formulation with dynamic joint strength is able to accurately predict all joint angles, box weight, and GRF.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Other than some regional case studies about Omani family firms, there appears to be a dearth of sufficient finer-grained analysis of what makes Omani family businesses unique. Therefore, this study examines the existing academic literature as well as non-academic publications from dependable sources such as reports from international consulting firms, to compile a nuanced analysis of how Omani family-controlled enterprises are different in many ways because of the idiosyncratic cultural context of Oman. The narrative in this chapter begins with an overall introduction of how family firms differ from non-family ones. Particular focus is laid on the theory of socioemotional wealth, the ability and willingness paradox, and family commitment as a source of competitiveness and organisational resilience. Thereafter, an overview about the Sultanate of Oman and the business ecosystem is presented. The subsequent sections elaborate on the idiosyncrasies of Omani family firms along with anecdotal evidence through examples of a few Omani family-controlled business organisations both large and small. Finally, the chapter ends with concluding remarks that relate the previous discourse about family businesses with the context of Omani family businesses.","['Business and Management', 'Family Business', 'Regional/Spatial Science', 'Economy-wide Country Studies']"

Starting from illustrating the essential aspects of the Embodied Cognition Theory, they highlight the overcoming of the classic cognitive division between mind and body, underlining how these two entities are intertwined in unexpected ways. Then, through the clinical description of dyspraxia, understood as an inability to carry out a pragmatically oriented action, the authors propose an understanding of this disorder according to the Embodied Mind theory. They affirm that dyspraxia consists of a pathogenic process in which that phase of movement in which the mind identifies itself is altered, thus dyspraxic disorder presupposes an alteration of unconscious processes. Therefore, dyspraxia is an alteration of the intentional movement and of the aimed action, it excludes the problem of the automatic response and since the conscious intention of the dyspraxic subject is safeguarded, it is very interesting to analyse in which movement phase programming this alteration occurs. To better explore this matter, the authors proposed a Laboratory Virtual Instrumentation Engineering Workbench based vast research program on the emergence of the mind from the body using dyspraxia as an experimental model.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

To overcome this difficulty, biomaterials are being created. A biocomposite based on mycelium and six different substrates has been developed to study its characteristics and possible applications in the substitution of ephemeral plastic-based products. The use of six leftovers or biological waste allows results to be compared between samples, to determine which leftovers or waste are revalued instead of being eliminated, in accordance with the principles of the circular economy (CE). Samples and specimens were developed for laboratory tests to characterize density, water absorption, and compression. All tests were carried out according to norms and standards that correspond to the plastics they can replace. Results indicate that the 6 types have very low densities, even lower than polymeric foams. They present good substrate properties in terms of compressive strength, with values similar to expanded polystyrene (EPS). In addition, all the samples are biodegradable since they do not require any type of coating, they can take a wide variety of shapes and the molds can be developed using various manufacturing techniques. Potential applications are found in the packaging industry since ephemeral containers require a certain resistance and low weight, being able to replace EPS or alveolar film. Being an inert material, it could be used in food packaging and even replace some applications of cardboard or paper pulp.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Computer-Aided Engineering (CAD, CAE) and Design']"

Arguably, the quality of experience is subjective. It depends on the experience of a given human user, on how they perceive, for example, a service, software, an application, etc. However, the quality of experience is the only criterion that actually counts to a user of a service. Although a perceived experience is subjective, in order for any system to be successful (i.e. the user accepts to use it), it is still imperative to identify, quantify and improve the perception of QoE for the user, throughout the system’s use. QoE is the collective effect of service performance determining a user’s degree of satisfaction – what a user experiences of the service’s accessibility, usability, retainability and integrity (Dillon et al. 2009). Ultimately, QoE is a measurement of the whole performance of a system at the user level, and it is an indication of the level a system satisfies the user’s (perceived) needs and expectations. Moreover, technology is not value-neutral (van de Poel 2012); value-sensitive design (Brey, 2010) is an approach that claims that designed artefacts are not morally neutral but harbour tendencies to promote or violate certain values. For example, web browsers and apps may be either designed to protect the user’s privacy or they may offer no such protection, or may even violate user privacy (Brey 2016).","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Computer Applications']"

For each of these formats, Machine Learning lends itself to stationary retail. This will be explored in more depth with the ON4OFF project example. However retailers deal with the results of such future projects, one thing is clear: there has been no shortage of digital retail initiatives since the start of the Corona pandemic. But even before the pandemic, there were numerous digital retail projects, the most important of which are briefly presented. This also shows that brick-and-mortar retail and city centres are a community of fate, which is why the topic of Smart City is also relevant for Intelligent Retail. And what the Smart City means for city centres on the one hand, is the intelligent shopping centre on the greenfield site on the other.","['Business and Management', 'Trade']"
doi:10.1007/978-981-19-4767-4_41,en,Development of Pulverized Coal/Ammonia Co-firing Technology,OriginalPaper,"This paper informs the achievements of the research activity related to the direct combustion of ammonia for the coal-fired power plant. There are some technical issues expected in the ammonia utilization for the coal-fired power plant. One is the increase of the NO concentration in the exhaust gas. Another is the inflection of the local heat flux on the boiler wall. The first issue related to the NO concentration was solved by the experimental approach with the 10 MW thermal input test facility. NO generation was under control by injecting the ammonia into the strong reduction zone, that is created by the coal combustion. Ammonia was well decomposed into the nitrogen and hydrogen in such a strong reduction zone. By this experiment, it was proved that the ammonia can be safely co-fired with coal by 20% in the calorific base. The second issue related to the heat flux on the boiler wall was discussed by the numerical analysis. The size of the boiler in this discussion was 1000 MW which is the biggest size in the present market. Although the gas temperature in the ammonia co-firing is a slightly lower than that in the coal firing, there is not largely different in the local heat flux nor total heat flux between coal firing and ammonia co-firing conditions. For the next step to penetrate this technology into the society, the demonstration in the commercial-scale boiler is demanded.","['Chemistry', 'Green Chemistry', 'Energy Storage', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering', 'Energy Materials', 'Energy Systems', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management']"

This study aims at identifying GHRM practices and assessing their impact on sustainable and operational performance. This current study adopted systematic literature and a content analysis approach for the development of a conceptual model. It has been found that the most influencing GHRM practices are green recruitment and selection, green training, green performance evaluation, and a green reward system. The uniqueness of this study is the evaluation of the GHRM practices with sustainable and operational performance in a single study. Moreover, the paper highlights that manufacturing organizations must focus on GHRM practices to deliver enhanced sustainable performance besides operational performance to achieve competitive advantage. For future studies, there is a need to empirically verify the proposed conceptual model presented in this paper. This study adds to the literature in the area of GHRM by advocation to tackle environmental challenges across the globe.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

Aiming at this, we put forward an indirect optimization method. We convert the problem with complicated constraints to an assignment generation strategy optimization problem with fewer constraints. The sensor/weapon target allocation is optimized indirectly through the optimization of the generation strategy. At the start of our method, the feasible assignment schemes for each target are generated according to various constraints. Every scheme is composed of the target, radar, and weapon. Then we choose the current optimal assignment(“current” means that the assignment will be optimized in the next steps) from them for each target in the order determined by the generation strategy and these assignments constitute the current optimal overall assignments. In this process, a variety of features representing the performance of feasible assignments are calculated and substituted into the evaluation function of features which is determined by the generation strategy. We choose the assignment with the maximum function value as the current optimal assignment for the target. In the process of optimization, the evaluation function value of the current optimal overall assignments is used to the corresponding generation strategy. While the differential evolution is used to optimize generation strategies, the current optimal overall assignments are optimized indirectly. So we encounter fewer constraints. It can be seen from the results that this method can obtain higher quality solutions after the same generations compared with other methods.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Multiagent Systems', 'Systems Theory, Control']"

Normal endogenous tau is highly soluble and intrinsically disordered when it is not bound to microtubules. Pathological tau proteins are aggregates of bioactive filaments capable of inducing their normal counterparts into pathological conformations that are human tauopathy dependent. Taking advantage of this feature, we established an in vitro seeding reaction to amplify faithfully human-derived tau strains. This approach allows us to expand the quantity and improve the quality of pathogenic tau strains derived from human patient postmortem brains and to further understand tau pathogenesis in models of tauopathy.

The kernel function of the method can be used to replace the complex inner product operation in the high-dimensional space and avoid the Curse of Dimensionality caused by high-dimensional calculation effectively. The kernel-based method has advantages on learnability, computational complexity, precise linearization and generalization performances, providing a promising way to solve the problem of nonlinear target tracking. In traditional tracking methods, nonlinear tracking models are usually built as a priori to predict the current state of target motion, emphasizing on tracking accuracy and real-time performance. However, kernel-based method provides a general way of linearization processing, which can be independent of specific models to achieve highly efficient data-driven computation. Introducing the kernel learning mechanism into target tracking problem is expected to improve the environmental adaptability. In this paper, a review on kernel learning method with application to randomly moving target tracking is presented, including kernel-based algorithms for target detection, kernel-based algorithms for generative tracking and for discriminant tracking, and multi-kernel learning methods with multiple kernel functions. Further research is prospected in optimization of kernel function, long-term robust tracking, feature extraction, target occlusion and other potential aspects on moving target tracking using kernel learning theory.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Sociology, general', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Machine Learning']"

There are four extant species of sirenians (three sea cows and the dugong) but the fossil record, which extends from the early Eocene, shows a much richer diversity, and global distribution. Sirenians belong to the crown-group Sirenia and their closest extinct relatives belong to Pan-Sirenia. Sirenia is nested within Tethytheria, along with elephants and desmostylids, and Tethytheria belongs to the larger mammalian clade Afrotheria. The paleoneurology of Pan-Sirenia and Sirenia is based on anatomical descriptions of approximately two dozen natural and digital cranial endocasts and a couple of bony labyrinth endocasts. Sirenian brains are characterized by lissencephalic cerebral hemispheres, reduced olfactory system, reduction in the optic nerves, presence of a large trigeminal nerve and associated components, and thick meninges of the central nervous system. In contrast to other modern paenungulates, which include the gyrencephalic and large-brained elephants, sirenians have lissencephalic brains whose components are linearly arranged, and small relative brain sizes (EQs). Future work is needed to further incorporate the anatomical diversity of sirenian cranial endocasts into phylogenetic character matrices and to increase our knowledge about the inner ear evolution of the group.","['Life Sciences', 'Evolutionary Biology', 'Paleontology', 'Vertebrates', 'Animal Anatomy / Morphology / Histology']"

The aims of this study were to determine the pre-operative physical function in patients having CRS-HIPEC and investigate the association between physical function and post-operative outcomes. Patients and Methods Patients undergoing CRS-HIPEC between 2017 and 2021 were recruited at a single quaternary referral hospital in Sydney, Australia. The primary physical function measures were the 6-min walk test (6MWT) and the five-times sit to stand test (5STS). Data were collected pre-operatively and at post-operative day 10, and were analysed according to pre-operative patient characteristics and post-operative outcomes such as length of hospital stay (LOS) and complications. Results The cohort of patients that participated in functional assessments consisted of 234 patients, with a median age of 56 years. Patients having CRS-HIPEC performed worse on the 6MWT pre-operatively compared with the general Australian population ( p < 0.001). Post-operatively, these patients experienced a further deterioration in 6MWT and 5STS performance and the degree of the post-operative decline in function was associated with post-operative morbidity. A higher level of pre-operative physical function was associated with shorter LOS and minor post-operative complications. Conclusions Patients who have undergone CRS-HIPEC were functionally impaired pre-operatively compared with the general population and experience a further deterioration of physical function post-operatively. A higher level of pre-operative physical function is associated with minor post-operative morbidity, which is highly relevant for pre-operative optimisation of patients with cancer.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery']"

The management of natural lighting depends largely on the characteristics of the building envelope (BE) in the building, especially the facade system. Adaptive facade (AF) is one of the solutions in the BE system of the building that helps to solve numerous problems in energy-efficiency and in particular, the balance of natural lighting. In this research, it is proposed that a kinematic AF system integrated onto the single-layer glass facade structure be implemented in HOBs in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), through the study of the typical case being the LIM Tower office building located in central HCMC. The kinetic AF system is integrated in order to improve the quality of natural lighting through 3 statistics: Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE), spatial Daylight Autonomy (sDA), and Daylight Factor (DF). Results from simulations utilizing Rhinoceros-Grasshopper software (Computer-Aid Design) and Climate Studio plugin show that the AF phenotypes significantly reduce the luminance in the room—a reduction of appropriately 50% compared to the case without AF. In cases of the proposed AF phenotypes, the ASE index decreased below 10% compared to natural daylight conditions and achieved 3 points according to LEED V4.1. During the daily opening and closing cycle of the AF, the ASE and sDA indices don’t observe many sudden fluctuations and remained stable within the allowed lighting range.","['Energy', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Structural Materials', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Construction Management', 'Environmental Policy']"

A technique in the modal domain called Nonlinear Coupling Procedure (NLCP) has been recently defined to couple subsystems connected through nonlinear connections by using their Nonlinear Normal Modes (NNMs). It manages to capture the main dynamic features of the system, i.e., the backbone of each NNM, and it provides satisfactory results in terms of mode shape and resonance frequency as function of the excitation level of the assembled system, with a considerable reduction of the computational time. However the results may be inaccurate due to approximations either in the models of the subsystems or due to the considered coupling technique. Furthermore, nonlinear subsystems can be the cause of complex behaviors of the assembly and then their models need to be carefully characterized. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate the reliability of the method in terms of the accuracy of the solution. This is done by defining a reliability ratio based on energy concepts depending on the level of the excitation acting on the system. The effectiveness of the reliability ratio of nonlinear techniques is verified on the NLCP applied to a mechanical system with localized nonlinearities.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Civil Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

In this context, the large-scale planning and redevelopment of historic centers lead to demanding research and reflection work on the part of the planner. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GAN) have shown how they can be helpful for image generation following certain imposed rules, including those coming from architecture. This research work, exploiting the potentialities of Computational Geometry and automated information management through Data Engineering processes, aims to offer a graphical decision-support tool for urban renewal based on GAN to elaborate new color scales respecting the pre-existing ones. The case study in which the proposed approach is tested is the historic center of Caggiano Municipality, a small inland village in the Campania Region (Italy). The color scale generated was evaluated and compared with the color plan adopted at the time, with results very close to the traditional approach. Therefore, GANs represent valuable graphic data management support for designers who have to deal with historical contexts, especially in the initial study and context analysis phase.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Computational Intelligence']"

In the conventional IS process, the decomposition of SO 3 in the H 2 SO 4 decomposition process requires a high temperature heat of approximately 900 °C. As SO 3 will be decomposed at 650 °C when using solar heat, a technology to improve the conversion rate in the SO 3 decomposition reaction is required. In addition, the conventional IS process has technical problems such as excessive amount of I 2 required in the Bunsen reaction (approx. nine times the amount required for the reaction) and a low conversion rate in the HI decomposition reaction. To solve these problems, research was conducted to apply membrane technology to the three main reactions of the IS process, namely the Bunsen reaction, SO 3 decomposition, and HI decomposition. The thermal mass balance calculation of the membrane IS process showed that the H 2 production efficiency of 40% or more can be obtained at 650 °C.","['Chemistry', 'Green Chemistry', 'Energy Storage', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering', 'Energy Materials', 'Energy Systems', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management']"

Therefore, the reservoir must be managed as a single entity to ensure long-term water conservation. However, the integrated operation of a multi-reservoir system becomes more difficult when there is less rainfall in a basin. For this reason, the existing operating policy must be evaluated to ensure integrated functioning. Metaheuristic-based algorithms such as genetic algorithms (GA) are employed in this study to find the optimal solution, and optimization efficiency can be improved by avoiding local optimal solutions. It aims to develop a steady-state optimum operating policy using a genetic algorithm that can satisfy long-term demand and measure the performance along with a deterministic simulation-optimization model (S-O Model) in terms of reliability, resilience, vulnerability, and sustainability indices of the existing multi-reservoir system, namely, Ravishankar Sagar reservoir, Dudhawa, and Murrum Silli in Chhattisgarh, India. In addition, the overall performance of the existing reservoir is improved based on reliability by 35.66%, resilience by 40.54%, sustainability by 36.70%, and vulnerability reduced by 54.09%, respectively, compared to actual water release. Apart from that, the GA model release satisfactorily meets the needs of demand, and no deficit conditions have occurred during the entire study period, excluding the years 1989–1990, 2001–2002, and 2002–2003, respectively.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Applications', 'Geography, general', 'Sustainable Development']"

We have gone from producing less than 10 million tons in the 1960s to more than 300 million in the 2010s. That plastic has had time to distribute itself, fragment and enter food chains of the oceans. Studies related to the three phenomena are now one of the main objectives of various research projects and groups around the planet. The first is understanding how fragmentation is increasing the volume of macro and microplastics, how they are dispersed at the oceanic and local level, and what their chemical characteristics are. In line with these observations and quantifications, we have to understand what influence they have on organisms and how we can reduce their concentration. For example, the displacements of macroplastics are modeled relative to their dispersion according to global and local currents, giving importance to the phenomena of fouling and fragmentation, as well as understanding how the creation of microplastics is heterogeneous according to latitude, water temperatures or seasonal conditions. One of the biggest problems is, without a doubt, the chemical, morphological and size classification of plastics, especially micro and nanoplastics. This topic is crucial, as is the standardization of the measures that we consider to classify them in one way or another. This topic has been largely discussed during the last decade, and in this chapter there are cues to understand that the consensus is very close. Other issues are still pending in the complex agenda of the understanding of these pollutants. For example, the adherence of certain types of elements such as heavy metals is a relevant issue on which much information is lacking. But it is not the only knowledge gap that we have. Dynamics in the water column and in the sediment is also a main issue, since this sediment is a sink for microplastics and nanoplastics that is continually disturbed by organisms from the meiofauna. Some of these microplastics become airborne, and their range from likely emission sources is still poorly understood. The understanding of these fluxes from the land-river to the sediments passing through the water column is one of the main challenges to solve the problems derived from the presence of such macro, micro and nano items. Marine organisms are the ones that, apparently, are the most affected by this increase in solid contamination, especially microplastics. Today they are found at any latitude, from the poles to the equator, even in places as surprising as sea ice or abyssal depths. In fact, microplastics are found in very remote places, interfering with the diet of various planktonic and benthic organisms. There are many questions to be resolved, among others, how temperature affects the retention of microplastics in organisms, or which are the most vulnerable species. And we have to understand one important issue: many of those marine organisms affected by micro and nano plastics are part of our diet. Therefore, understanding the rate of transmission in food chains in general and in our consumption in particular is a major issue. That is why we looked for solutions, such as the use of bioremediators (active suspension feeders such as sponges, sea squirts, etc.) in areas where the abundance of microplastics is especially high. Bacteria are also beginning to be used as active decomposers of microplastics, a solution that could help eliminate a large amount of this material about which we still have too many knowledge gaps regarding the health of ecosystems and our own health. The synergy of efforts to understand all these different variables is crucial. During the next decade we do have to solve this plastic problem, with coordination, standardization and the application of different tools to execute the solutions of different associated problems.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"

The suspension system is modeled as a quarter car, where the effect of a single link length is analyzed in the form of equivalent stiffness and damping. The linear quadratic regulator is considered for the control design. The control system's performance was tested on a non-linear model with road disturbances consisting of bumpy roads and highway roads.

However, there is an urgent demand for performing essential experimental measurements to validate the new theoretical model before further promotion to engineering applications. In this paper, the numerical simulations of the NCCR model with Jiang’s undecomposed algorithm and Navier–Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations by in-house code are in comparison with experimental measurements to validate the applicability and accuracy of the NCCR theory in hypersonic flows. The wind tunnel experiments of HB-2 model were conducted at Ma 5 with five different angles of attack ( $$\mathrm{\alpha }=\pm 4^\circ , \pm 2^\circ , 0$$ α = ± 4 ∘ , ± 2 ∘ , 0 ) in the Φ120 mm hypersonic wind tunnel. It was found that the flow field simulation results by NSF equations and the NCCR model, including aerodynamic force and shock wave structure position, are consistent with the experimental results. Most importantly, the NCCR model could completely recover the flow field solutions of NSF equations in hypersonic continuum flows. Thus, the accuracy and physical consistency of the NCCR model is critically examined and validated for hypersonic flow in continuum region.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

To address this, a solar test cell was constructed and placed on the roof of the Albert A Thornborough building at the University of Guelph from June to August 2021. The test cell was built to allow controlled investigation of thermal properties of a simplified version of a greenhouse, with fewer unknown values and relationships. The experimental set-up included 6 mil polyethylene glazing above a 10 cm deep air layer, above 5 cm of sand. The structure was framed with dimensional lumber and particle board and included 2.5 cm of foam board insulation on side walls and below the sand layer to mitigate heat loss. Interior and exterior temperature and relative humidities, as well as wind speed and solar irradiance were recorded over the duration of the experiment. Heat transfer in the cell was simulated with a modified one-dimensional lumped capacitance model that tracked heat fluxes between discrete layers. Identifying the optimal parameters for this test cell allow for relevant findings to be transferred to more complex greenhouse models. Two multivariable sensitivity analyses were conducted on parameters and relationships used in the model, with the optimized configuration resulting in root mean squared errors for air temperature that were less than 5 °C, with a daily air temperature range of over 70 °C. Also included is a methodology for finding the thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of the soil using measured temperatures.","['Energy', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Environmental and Sustainability Education', 'Sustainable Development', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Natural Resource and Energy Economics']"

POPs consist mainly of organochlorine pesticides, industrial compounds (PCBs, PBDEs, PFAS, PCN, and SCCPs), and chemical-delivered unintentional by-products of urban and industrial processes (dioxins and furans). They persist in the environment, are adsorbed to organic matter of soils and sediments, bioaccumulate in fatty tissues and biomagnify through the food web, and are transported across international boundaries far from their sources, through moving air masses, water currents, and migratory species. The dynamics of POPs in the environment depends on several factors, such as physicochemical characteristics of POPs and abiotic components, environmental conditions, and properties of the species inhabiting different ecosystems.

The sequence of events under study seems to be quite chaotic, but there are common trends and a limited number of logics at play. Building on the chapters gathered in this volume, one can draw four main lessons from the recent developments of European integration. 1. The 2019 elections strongly impacted the internal dynamics of the EP, the composition of the Commission, interinstitutional relations, and the overall direction of the EU’s actions—especially with the Green Deal. 2. The Covid-19 crisis has led to important transformations at the institutional level: it has been a booster for executive institutions but has also fostered change in the EP and allowed it to remain on the map. 3. At the policy level, the crisis has led the EU to focus on public health and has made possible an ambitious recovery plan. 4. These evolutions are not unique, unpredictable, or the result of a given context: they follow trends that reach in the past and are quite stable over time, even if they are not easy to read or understand. 2019 was a turning point, but there is more to come: the 2024 elections will be just as important, in several respects.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Legislative and Executive Politics']"

At the Terrafame mine (previously Talvivaara), the complexity of the black schist orebody precluded the production of a suitable concentrate and a decision was made to bioleach the crushed ore in heaps. To date, it is the only industrial-scale mine to utilise heap bioleaching for nickel production. In the case of Mondo Minerals, a sulfide concentrate, generated as a by-product from talc mining operations, contains significant quantities of nickel and cobalt, but also a small but significant quantity of arsenic. Previously the concentrates had been sold to toll smelters, but the arsenic content has made this option less attractive. Tank bioleaching technology was identified as the most suitable option for the recovery of nickel and cobalt from this sidestream and led to the first commercial implementation of nickel sulfide concentrate bioleaching.

However, cellular neurophysiologists have identified two broad classes of plasticity. Hebbian forms of plasticity alter synaptic strength in a synapse specific manner in the same direction of the initial conditioning stimulation. In contrast, homeostatic plasticities act globally over longer time frames in a negative feedback manner to counter network level changes in activity or synaptic strength. Recent evidence suggests that homeostatic plasticity mechanisms can be rapidly engaged, particularly by fast-acting antidepressants such as ketamine to trigger behavioral effects. There is increasing evidence that several neuropsychoactive compounds either directly elicit changes in synaptic activity or indirectly tap into downstream signaling pathways to trigger homeostatic plasticity and subsequent behavioral effects. In this review, we discuss this recent work in the context of a wider paradigm where homeostatic synaptic plasticity mechanisms may provide novel targets for neuropsychiatric treatment advance.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Psychiatry', 'Neurosciences', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Biological Psychology']"

Vaspin, a serpin-derived adipokine, is an essential linker between metabolic alterations, obesity, and insulin resistance. Vaspin mRNA is expressed in different tissues and has different roles in various tissues. This adipokine has anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects and is considered an insulin sensitizer whose intracellular and extracellular levels are affected by metabolic changes. Because vaspin was first identified in the visceral adipose tissue of a rat model of type 2 diabetes and obesity, various laboratory and clinical studies have been performed to introduce it as a biomarker of diabetes. The incidence of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes is associated with the function of vaspin as an insulin sensitizer, which is quite different from the mechanism of type 1 diabetes. This chapter discusses the studies conducted in recent years about the probability of recognizing vaspin as a biomarker for the prognosis and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. The potential role of vaspin in the body, molecular mechanisms, and signaling pathways associated with vaspin and type 2 diabetes also has been reviewed to achieve the aim of the chapter. It is concluded that circulating vaspin level may be considered as a potential biomarker in assessing type 2 diabetes and the prognosis of its complications.","['Biomedicine', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Pharmacology/Toxicology']"

We had compared the European ULLL model to an ideal institutional model, i.e., the LLLU model, which should be an agile and flexible organization where learning is lifelong and lifewide, fully connected with individuals, communities, and societal aspirations and needs. This chapter examines how far ULLL developed in this direction subsequently, the new impulses following the Covid crisis and megatrends in contemporary society. In our view, three key aspirations emerge from debates and surveys: critical thinking, learning space, and learning time. The chapter revisits these concepts and explores them in a social and democratic perspective. More than ever, critical thinking appears as the priority to promote and develop in all university domains (learning, teaching, researching, and managing). Moreover, universities are invited to re-think learning time and space inside and outside the university and to develop oases supporting different kinds of learning – informal, non-formal, and formal – promoting learners’ emancipation and responsibility. Hybridization, diversification, and extension of learning spaces and diversity of learning rhythms, ownership, and slowness of learning time are all essential. The chapter highlights important elements to be considered specifically by European universities, but applicable more widely, in developing lines of action to implement an LLLU culture moving toward a learning organization. It finally suggests perspectives for further research.","['Education', 'Education, general']"

Rivers change their riverbed geometry (longitudinal profile, cross-sections, riverbed shapes in horizontal projection) over time, depending on geological, hydrological, and hydraulic characteristics of watercourses and catchment area, and sediment characteristics. The riverbed of the alluvial watercourse is in the process of constant adaptation to changes in water flow and sediment, as well as changes in water regime. The causes of morphological changes in the riverbed can be natural phenomena (hydrological – hydraulic influences) and anthropogenic activities. The paper presents an approach to determining the magnitude of riverbed deformation based on the definition of dimensionless parameters of spatial deformation of the river bed. These parameters are in the function of hydrological and hydraulic flow characteristics and are the result of morphological analysis of watercourses. Experimental research was conducted on the “Željeznica” River in the area of the field “Sarajevsko polje”, which is located at the foot of the Igman and Bjelašnica mountains in the central part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Morphological changes in the riverbed were monitored for 10 - year period from 2009 to 2019.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In this contribution, a yeast is represented as a thin-walled, liquid-filled, impermeable, spherical shell structure. Herein, we adopt the quasi-Kirchhoff shell theory that we extend to the range of finite viscoelasticity. The used kinematics is the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into an elastically relaxing part and a viscous part. Motivated by a generalized Maxwell model, we assume an incompressible hyper-viscoelastic model of N = 1-Ogden-Ogden type. In addition, the cell-wall is regarded as homogeneous and isotropic in a first approach. On another hand, the internal cell-liquid resists to external loads by a normal pressure on the cell-wall. This pressure is represented by using follower loads, the magnitude of which is accounted for via an updated procedure of the Uzawa-type to insure the incompressibility of this inner fluid. Furthermore, adopting a frictionless contact, on one hand, and using intrinsic parameters from the literature, on the other hand, we predict within the finite element method the responses of various compressed cells between flat parallel surfaces and probes of different geometries.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Materials Engineering', 'Classical and Continuum Physics']"

Deeply scaled short-channel transistors are faster but consume more off-state power. This power vs speed trade-off stems from the fundamental physical limit related to the thermionic emission that governs switching in field-effect transistors. There is a broad consensus in the semiconductor industry that future progress is impossible unless the next-generation transistors and circuits overcome the so-called Boltzmann limit associated with thermionic emission over a barrier and offer a steeper on-off switching to enable a more aggressive voltage scaling. In this chapter, we explain the need for and suggest an intuitive classification of the emerging transistor technologies. We use two illustrative examples of next-generation transistors (i.e., negative capacitance FET (NCFET) and phase FET (PhaseFET)) to explain the relative merits of gate-controlled vs channel-controlled steep-slope switching. We explain the basic principle of device operation, summarize the experimental results reported in the literature, and highlight the speed and reliability challenges to be resolved before the devices are integrated into practical systems. In addition, the chapter includes a careful analysis of circuits based on these emerging transistor technologies with applications toward Boolean logic, memories, and non-Boolean computing. The analysis suggests relative merits of various circuit designs and application-specific opportunities for significant power-performance improvement.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Electronic Circuits and Devices', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation']"

Therefore, development of kinetic model that can be applied to various operating conditions is important for design of the ammonia production system. In this chapter, kinetic analysis of ammonia synthesis on ruthenium-based catalysts under high pressure conditions for simulating the reactor situation under varying hydrogen supply is discussed. Various kinetic analysis on iron-based catalysts is considered, and then the reaction rate equation for ruthenium-based catalysts is estimated. In analysis of kinetics of ammonia synthesis over Ru/Cs/MgO catalyst, ammonia production on this catalyst is well explained by the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model. In kinetic analysis for Ru/CeO 2 , an optimized kinetic model on the catalyst is showed to be different from that on the above-mentioned Ru/Cs/MgO catalyst. And it could be estimated that Ru/CeO 2 performs favorable activity as an ammonia synthesis catalyst under high pressure conditions. Additionally, the intermediate surface species (NH x ) on Ru/CeO 2 is suggested to be contribute to the total rate of ammonia synthesis under high pressure conditions.","['Chemistry', 'Green Chemistry', 'Energy Storage', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering', 'Energy Materials', 'Energy Systems', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management']"

Journalists report extreme transgressions leading to scandals, court cases and social or environmental disasters. The more moderate examples of unethical business behaviour are known by insiders, but less by outsiders. Business ethicists have rarely explored such more common transgressions empirically, and they lack own methods to do so. This chapter introduces four research methods that use business jokes on ethical transgressions. The chapter first explains how critical insider jokes can illustrate common unethical practices in business, second how they can stimulate conversation about them in open in-depth interviews, third how they can be used as statements to be rated in a survey and fourth how they can be used as a source for content analysis. This introductory chapter concludes with an outline of the entire book and its four methods, showing their contributions to research methods in business ethics.

Since real-world cases are complex and computationally challenging systems that require effective optimization techniques, therefore recently, approximate resolution methods, specifically metaheuristics frameworks are in focus. In this research, we investigate a specific variant of Network Design Problems (NDPs), namely the Generalized Discrete Cost Multicommodity Network Design Problem (GDCMNDP), which seeks to find a network that optimizes the total costs while fulfilling several design restrictions. A promising newly developed solution approach based on the Archimedes Optimization Algorithm (AOA) that has not been tackled in the previous studies for solving NDPs is proposed. To assess its performance, the proposed approach is applied to benchmark network scenarios from the literature. The obtained solutions are compared with well-known state-of-the-art metaheuristic solutions. Results highlight the promising performance of the AOA for solving such NP-hard Network Design Problems.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Therefore, metaheuristic algorithms are the best choice to find this optimal value.

It spans two neighboring countries, namely India and Bangladesh. In this article, we strive to assess the vegetation health of the Sundarbans region. We rely on the satellite images from Landsat 8 from January 2014 to January 2020. The vegetation health assessment is based on two indices, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and forest canopy density (FCD) analysis of the interest area. NDVI consists of two bands: red and infrared band, showing a negative trend of 0.0085 per year. The image difference technique is employed further to study the vegetation health of the area of interest. NDVI difference marks the coastal regions with a higher depletion rate of vegetation than the regions away from the sea coasts. The histogram of the NDVI difference shows a negative shift from the central zero axis, which is the zone of no change in the vegetation cover. Being an early model to study vegetation health, NDVI has some disadvantages. It tends to quickly saturates at high biomass content and blurs the difference between moderately high plant cover from very high plant cover. So, we have taken another model, FCD, to compare the results of NDVI with it. It highlights the sharp depletion of highly forested cover. Nearly, 80% of the highly forested region has been depleted and joins the medium forested area. The overall mangrove cover is likely to dip more in the ensuing decades if governments of the two countries do not take necessary measures.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics']"

However, this region faces more difficult challenges in attracting qualified labor forces than other areas. To meet the region’s needs, there should be coordination between management units, training units, investors, and construction organizations to provide strategies to attract more construction employees. Using a questionnaire which includes 36 potential factors regarding the retention of employees in construction, 160 responses were collected from different organizations in the Mekong Delta region. The results indicated several important factors which could affect employee retention such as base salary, salary payment term, labor contract, labor market mobility, and opportunities to participate in large construction projects. Using factor analysis, this study also identified eight main influential constructs of employee retention in the Mekong Delta area’s construction fields, namely organizational conditions and policies (C1), motivation (C2), working environment (C3), demanding (C4), income (C5), job opportunities (C6), welfare (C7), and job nature (C8).

In Russia, research in this area is carried out mainly in the field of technical resilience, while in Western Europe this area is considered more broadly and also includes environmental, psychological, social and economic resilience. When studying the resilience of energy systems, the authors are based on studies of energy security that use the concept of situational management. For a qualitative description of situations, it is proposed to use intelligent technologies, in particular, cognitive modeling based on a graph representation of cognitive models. After a qualitative assessment of the situation, it is usually desirable for a decision maker (DM) to have a quantitative justification for the recommended decisions. To meet this requirement, it is proposed to integrate intelligent and mathematical technologies. The team represented by the authors developed the cognitive modeling tool CogMap and reengineered the existing version of the legacy SP INTEC (a modern version of the multi-agent SP - INTEC-A was developed). Currently, the results of cognitive modeling are entered into the PC manually, while work is underway to automate the transition from cognitive maps to ExS scenarios in INTEC-A. An example of a computational experiment using cognitive models and INTEC-A software is given. It seems that the integration of intelligent and mathematical technologies can be successfully used to support decision-making in research and ensuring the resilience of energy systems and can become the basis of an intelligent decision support system (IDSS) in this area.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

When offloading parts of a robot’s processing to the cloud, system performance and safety become highly dependent on the capacity of network and cloud technologies to fulfill a given set of requirements. This is further complicated when the robot must interact with a person, and HRI may be compromised by poor QoS. Although research in the field of cloud-enabled and human-in-the-loop CPS has gained traction in the last years, there is still a need for systematically setting the requirements posed by the interplay of these factors. This results in a lack of understanding of how infrastructure-related QoS issues inherent to cloud robotics affect user-perceived QoE during HRI. In this chapter, we use the eHealth field to highlight the importance of understanding a system’s requirements during cloud integration. By the end of the chapter, we present a case study considering cloud-enabled robots used for assisting human locomotion. This kind of system relies on close physical HRI and imposes multiple challenges on the adoption of cloud robotics.

However, as society has looked to minimizing the impact on the natural world by implementing sustainability strategies, and more recently has recognized the need to make human settlements resilient as well as sustainable, the need to create sustainable and resilient human development has emerged. When one further considers the interrelationships between carbon emissions, climate change and climate impacts, this need becomes imminent. While this is true for many hazards, fire is a particular hazard of concern, since fire as a natural hazard is being increased in frequency and intensity by changes in climate that are increasing drought conditions and high temperatures, and fire as a technological hazard can be inadvertently increased by implementation of energy sustainability measures, such as localized energy sources (e.g., photovoltaics) creating potential ignition hazards, and thermal insulation (specifically combustible materials) creating additional fuel load. In order to most comprehensively address and mitigate the increasing fire risk is to adopt the concepts of a Sustainable And Fire Resilient Built Environment (SAFR-BE), where the built environment includes buildings (structures, facilities), infrastructure and communities. This chapter introduces the concept of SAFR-BE and how such holistic thinking can be applied to reduce environmental and other impacts of fire.","['Engineering', 'Fire Science, Hazard Control, Building Safety', 'Environmental Health', 'Climate Change/Climate Change Impacts']"

In the field of pressure, the advancement in technology is mainly based on two factors: (i) geometrical parameters (fabrication of large diameter cylinders and piston) (ii) on dimension and high accuracy. There are many devices for pressure measurement like barometer, manometer, deadweight tester, etc. However, the accuracy in measurement for deadweight testers is highest. Therefore, the main focus of this paper is on deadweight tester, precise and accurate measurements of the pressure and calibration and measurement capabilities (CMC) of parameter ‘pressure’ for CSIR-NPL (National Physical Laboratory). CSIR-NPL provides various services to the industry of India by generating the CMC value for different standards, including for the pressure metrology.","['Engineering', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation', 'Quantum Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation']"

Organizations require agility in their supply chains to better manage disruption risks, ensure uninterrupted service, and provide superior value to customers. A systematic cultivation of agility is required in all segments of the supply chain, with the ability to anticipate as well as respond rapidly, in a coordinated fashion, to supply and operational disruptions. Supply chain agility is thus of value for both risk mitigation and response. This chapter provides an updated perspective on agility, based on a summary of research conducted to date, along with current and emerging managerial and research concerns. Major gaps in the literature and shortfalls in practice are summarized, along with critical needs in both research and practice domains. The research literature on agility is covered under the categories of: (1) Supply chain disruption risk management; (2) Conceptualization and evolving definitions of agility; (3) Antecedents, drivers, and impacts of supply chain agility; (3) Current managerial concerns regarding the vulnerabilities of supply chains and major gaps in the literature; (4) Emergent concerns regarding both research and managerial practices on agility; and (5) Managerial implications and specific actions that may be pursued to enhance agility, followed by the conclusions. It is hoped that the material presented promotes convergence of research and managerial practices aimed at enhancing the robustness of global supply chains amidst increasing turbulence and volatility.","['Business and Management', 'Supply Chain Management']"

Changes in the profiles of women MPs and in gender patterns of elites are unable to cancel the idea that women in Parliament form an exception, while latent questionings are perpetuated, concerning who women elected represent: the “people”, or women? The latter, usually insinuated in the demand for “more women in parliament”, attests to the confusion among different meanings of “representation”. The article deals with the history of Greek women’s presence in parliament, the pre-1989 period indicating the climate of the first “exceptional women” elected, creating a pattern of “widows and wives” in politics. Dealing with the meagre results of electoral gender quotas and attempting to generalise its considerations on the Greek case the article discusses political representation in patriarchal societies, differentiating among more and less traditional gender regimes. It questions the implied causal direction in the relation of social inequality and political exclusion, claiming that in more traditional gender regimes more women in politics do not automatically serve better women’s interests, nor do they necessarily form a solution to gender inequality. The substantive solution to women’s political exclusion presupposes rather than provokes wider social changes.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Political Sociology', 'Political Communication', 'Political Leadership']"

Green Engagements and Compromised Conventions in the Twenty-First Century,ReviewPaper,"As the problem of (un-)sustainable urbanism has gained practical and intellectual prominence from the 1990s onward, scholars affiliated with the economics and sociology of conventions (EC/SC) have responded via new avenues of inquiry. Broadly speaking, these represent the meeting-point of two wider strands of questioning, one concerning the justification of ecology as a possible new order of worth, the other concerning the conditions of shared inhabitation and public-political coordination in the city. Since around 2010, these strands have merged in a concerted questioning of life, activism, and politics in and of the (un-)sustainable city, drawing mostly on Boltanski and Chiapello’s diagnosis of a new spirit of capitalism and Laurent Thévenot’s sociology of engagements and commonalities. This chapter reviews the resultant contributions and places them within a wider interdisciplinary landscape of studies into contemporary urban change. First, the text places issues of (un-)sustainability in the context of wider attempts by EC/SC-informed scholars to reframe widespread diagnoses of the “neoliberal” or “entrepreneurial” city, including by way of theorizing the rise of a so-called certified city. Based on this overall conceptualization, the chapter reviews in turn EC-/SC-based contributions to the study of sustainability-oriented urban planning, urban green activism, and new translocal regimes of urban sustainability benchmarking, the latter representing a still-emergent research domain. The chapter concludes by summarizing key EC/SC contributions to understanding strivings for sustainable urbanism in the twenty-first century and locates avenues where further inquiry will prove fruitful, based in part on reconnecting with broader strands of EC/SC.","['Economics', 'Labor Economics', 'Heterodox Economics', 'Organizational Studies, Economic Sociology']"

Undoubtedly, paragraph 49 of Notebook 3 is the one in which Gramsci most clearly outlines the historical task of a hegemonic conquest of the “elements of trenches and fortifications” underpinning the articulation of civil society, based on a process of material and spiritual self-determination of subaltern groups that, to use a typical expression of Georges Sorel, Gramsci identifies as the “spirit of cleavage”.","['Philosophy', 'Political Philosophy', 'History of Italy', 'Political Theory', 'History, general']"

Several IMU sensor fusion algorithms have been proposed in literature. Kalman Filter and its variants are the most used for more precision. However, they are computationally expensive. However, for faster computations, researchers and industry use complementary filter. More recently, a new variant of Kalman Filter was introduced as a Double Stage Kalman Filter in order to reduce the Kalman Filters computation cost. Our research investigates the performance of the Complementary and Double Stage Kalman filters in monitoring of joints in serial manipulators using Microelectromechanical-system MEMS based IMU. This study carried dynamic experiments using a serial robot to estimate the orientation of IMU, thus the joint angle of the associated segment. The study showed that both filters yield accurate estimations. The study showed also that Double Stage Kalman Filter has lower RMSE and achieves more precise estimates than Complementary filter mainly when the movement is around IMU x- and y- axis. Our findings indicate that the Double Stage Kalman Filter can achieve higher precision than the complementary filter using lower computation time than the former variants of the Kalman Filters in serial manipulator joint monitoring applications.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Materials Engineering', 'Classical and Continuum Physics']"

Having already been adopted by companies like Google, Microsoft, IBM, etc., it is slowly but steadily making its way into the mainstream market, which is evident from the exponential increase in the size of the cloud servers over the past few years. Being a computational process where extensible resources are conveyed as facilities to customers using online methods, Cloud computing needs to have a method for choosing the correct resources for executing processes within a given framework. This is called task-scheduling. Various task-scheduling models are in use currently, but the one that we will be focusing on is the NN (Neural Network)-based model. This model was set up to estimate the task execution status for resource allotment among the candidates. An NN-based model makes use of various scheduling algorithms to formulate optimum results in terms of quality of service (QoS), total cost, service satisfaction, etc. Through our work, we are simulating various task-scheduling algorithms in a virtual environment and comparing their efficiency based on the results we obtain from these simulations. While our focus will be on an emerging metaheuristic optimization algorithm called the Harmony Search Algorithm, we are also running simulations for the Moth algorithm, and the Genetic Algorithm.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering']"

Weeds are one of the main challenges that severely affect the agricultural production and its quality. An accurate, automatic, low cost, little environmental impacts and real-time weeds detection technique is required to control weeds effectively on fields. In addition, automating the classification process of weeds based on their growth stages is crucial for using appropriate weeds-controlling techniques. In this paper, we fly a drone to collect a dataset of four different weed (Consolida Regalis) growth stages. As well, we developed and trained deep learning object detector (YOLOv5) to detect weed (Consolida Regalis) and to classify its four growth stages in real-time with a sufficient accuracy. The results show that the generated YOLOv5 small model succeeds to detect and classify the weed’s growth stages in real-time with highest recall 0.794 at 156 FPS. However, YOLOv5 large model depicts efficient detection and classification precision of 0.827 at 70 FPS.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Solar energy, which generates both heat and light, is the most abundant source of energy. Solar photovoltaic modules use solar radiations to generate electricity and thermal energy, while the remaining solar radiation content is lost to the environment. The first law of thermodynamics was used to perform an energy analysis on a solar photovoltaic module, and the second law of thermodynamics was used to perform an exergy analysis to determine energy losses and exergy efficiency during the photovoltaic conversion process. The operating parameters of a solar photovoltaic module are as follows: ambient temperature, photovoltaic module surface temperature, overall heat transfer coefficient, short circuit current, open circuit voltage, fill factor and solar radiation. These were achieved on a sunny day in the month of February at R.L.J.I.T, Doddaballapur. The experimental data are utilised to calculate the solar photovoltaic module’s energy and exergy efficiencies. The efficiency of the solar panel performance decreases as the temperature of the module rises. As a result, by reducing heat from the surface of the solar photovoltaic module, the module’s efficiency can be increased. Surface heat can be eliminated by delivering water or air as a medium to the solar photovoltaic module. Finally, ANN model was developed to determine the performance prediction models using multilayer perceptron neural network, and it reveals that the developed model with six neurons gives better performance with a confidence interval of 95%.","['Engineering', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Energy Storage']"

It is associated with chronic disease, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, serious infections, and even an increased prevalence of morbidity and mortality in countries with poor socioeconomic or environmental factors. Adequate food administration is essential to satisfy the main caloric and nutritional demands of humans. The most significant factors seen in the development of protein-energy malnutrition in areas of high incidence, such as underdeveloped countries, are inadequate food and nutrient supplies. It has been well established that one of the strategies to alleviate undernourishment is the biofortification of staple crops. This is because vegetables and plants are significant sources of crucial nutrients for human growth and development. To enhance plant nutrition, recent tactics aim to formulated balanced and diverse diets with acceptable levels of vitamins and minerals that benefit human health. New advances in plant biotechnology and animal productivity could control key enzymes in several metabolic pathways, enriching important nutrients such as iron and vitamins and decreasing the content of disadvantageous compounds such as acrylamide-forming amino acids and phytic acids. Numerous biofortified crops such as rice, maize, and wheat have been created to resolve the problem of nutrition deficiencies.

This paper presents a simulation of the load shedding based on load priority parameters, such as economic, social, and technical. The approach considered in this paper provides a weighting method. The weighting method is modeled by assigning the weight factor to each load in the system depending on the momentary costs per outage per customer, the possibility of disconnection, and the level of criticality. Three types of loads are assumed: industrial (factories, hospitals, and fire stations), commercial (shopping centres, banks, schools), and residential (condominiums, houses, other loads). The load weighting factor is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the weighting factors related to technical, social, and economic aspects for each load. The percentage of power to disconnect from each load is obtained by dividing the weighting factor of the load by the sum of the weighting factor of all loads. At the moment of a generation power outage, the result obtained represents the percentage of power that each load assumes to disconnect, depending on the priority assigned to it. The development of a load shedding algorithm based on load prioritization is implemented on NE 39-bus test system.

However, heritable symbioses also tend to be inconspicuous and are often understudied. Heritable fungal symbionts of plants, which we call seed endophytes, have been discovered and rediscovered in a few grass species (family Poaceae) starting well over a century ago, but have been intensively researched only in the last 45 years since their ability to produce antimammalian alkaloids was revealed to cause major toxicoses to livestock. The characterization of those fungal Epichloë species has been followed gradually by documentation of other seed endophytes with bioactive alkaloids, such as those found in locoweeds (family Fabaceae) and morning glories (family Convolvulaceae).

Since the middle of nineteenth century, global surface temperature has risen by more than 1 °C. Since the beginning of the twentieth century, global mean sea level has risen about 200 mm. Extreme weather events have become more frequent and intensive since the middle of twentieth century. Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from human activities have substantially increased the greenhouse effect and global warming. To limit global warming to well below 2 °C and limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, the global community needs to achieve net-zero emissions as soon as possible. Given that China is the world’s largest emitter of GHG, the global fight against climate change would eventually fail without China’s net-zero efforts. The world needs China to succeed. However, major changes are needed for China to secure its net-zero emissions by 2060. This is a real challenge.","['Energy', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Sustainable Development', 'Climate, general', 'Fossil Fuels (incl.

Economic recovery is now an opportunity to rebuild natural capital alongside financial, physical, social and human capital, for long-term societal benefit. Yet, current decision-making is dominated by economic imperatives and information systems that do not consider society’s dependence on natural capital and the ecosystem services it provides. New international standards for natural capital accounting (NCA) are now available to integrate environmental information into government decision-making. By revealing the effects of policies that influence natural capital, NCA supports identification, implementation and monitoring of Green Recovery pathways, including where environment and economy are most positively interlinked.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Physical Geography', 'Environmental Management', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"
doi:10.1007/698_2022_847,en,Pharmaceuticals and Their Metabolites in Sewage Sludge and Soils: Distribution and Environmental Risk Assessment,OriginalPaper,"Pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs) are continually discharged to sewer systems through human excreta. In wastewater treatment plants, these compounds are partially removed by biodegradation or retention onto the sludge generated during wastewater treatment. As a result, they can end up in the aquatic environment, through the discharge of wastewater effluents to the receiving waters, or to the soil, through the application of the sludge as organic amended, or by the irrigation with recycled water. Moreover, these compounds are partially metabolized after their consumption, and, as a result, PhCs and their metabolites are present in the environment. This chapter summarizes recent research on the occurrence of PhCs and their metabolites in sewage sludge stabilization processes and on sludge-amended soils. Recent studies have shown that antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antidepressants, and antidiabetics are the most abundant PhCs found in sludge matrices. Overall, attenuation of PhCs concentrations occurs during sludge stabilization, and particularly during anaerobic digestion and composting. The potential ecotoxicological risk associated with the presence of PhCs in amended soils is medium-low for most PhCs. The most critical compounds found in sludge-amended soils are ciprofloxacin, 17α-ethinylestradiol, and 17β-estradiol.","['Environment', 'Environmental Chemistry', 'Waste Management/Waste Technology', 'Agriculture', 'Pollution, general', 'Applied Microbiology']"

In a first step, it gives an overview of the most relevant cases of art forgery in the recent past and addresses the consequences. Throughout this chapter it becomes visible that the status quo in authentication processes is inadequate and that art experts can face liability for expressing opinions. This liability, often referred to as leading to a crisis in authentication, is discussed within the jurisdictions of Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom and the United States and encourages the discussion of how art experts could and should take precautions against the risk of litigation. In a second step, the fact that an unprecedented number of authentication boards ceased their authentication activities due to an enormous increase in legal defence costs, prompts the assessment of several case studies in the field. Lastly, this chapter deals with the standard tool of catalogue raisonnés and with the question if art experts authoring such a volume should be fearful of liability as well. The chapter closes with case studies aimed at illustrating if courts of law are well equipped to rule on questions of authenticity and paths the way to the ensuing chapter, concluding that the current state of authentication is inadequate and in need of reform.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law', 'Theories of Law, Philosophy of Law, Legal History', 'Arts', 'Archaeology', 'Cultural Heritage']"

Therefore, the issues of studying the mechanisms for ensuring the sustainable development of a particular industry and the entire socio-economic sphere are relevant and necessary. This article discusses the problems of modern understanding and evaluation of the effectiveness of the functioning of the infrastructure of the Russian agro-industrial complex as a significant indicator of the sustainable development of agricultural production. To do this, we used an extensive methodological base based on the use of abstract-logical, monographic, economic-statistical, computational-constructive methods, factor analysis and the method of canonical correlations. On the example of the municipal districts of the Stavropol Territory, a methodology for assessing the relationship between the state of development of the non-productive sphere of the agro-industrial complex (its infrastructure), production potential and the efficiency of production activities is formulated. Based on the results of the assessment, we proposed a grouping of the municipal districts of the study region according to the level of interconnection between the production potential of the agro-industrial complex and its non-productive sphere. The proposed methodology makes it possible to determine the factors that constrain the intensive functioning of the production and social infrastructure, on the basis of which it is possible to develop directions for improving and balancing the production and non-production spheres of the agricultural industry. The conducted study made it possible to draw attention to the importance of not only a quantitative assessment of social and industrial infrastructure, but the importance of assessing the relationship between the state of development of the non-productive sphere of the agro-industrial complex (its infrastructure), production potential and the efficiency of production activities in order to develop further tools to improve the efficiency of the industry.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Data Engineering']"

However, there are limitations to FIB as accurate indicators of the presence of pathogens of concern, such as Cryptosporidium , as well as in the time-delay in FIB measurement. The objective of this work was to improve microbial water quality assessments by using data-driven approaches to predict day-to-day FIB, Escherichia coli ( E. coli ), and Cryptosporidium spp. concentrations based on simple water quality measures and weather data that can be monitored in real-time. To achieve this, we investigated the applicability of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs), an Artificial Intelligence-type algorithm that can provide probabilistic predictions using distinct data sources. Compared to other standard prediction methods, BBNs were observed to improve performance significantly and achieved greater than 75% accuracy for predicting FIB and E. coli concentrations. Following success in predicting FIB, predictability of Cryptosporidium , one of the major contributors to worldwide waterborne disease, was then investigated. One of the major challenges of modelling this parasite is dealing with a high number of non-detects and sparse data. Applicability of novel data augmentation and oversampling algorithms, such as the Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Algorithm (ADASYN), was investigated to improve the prediction model's performance. Leveraging the capability of the ADASYN significantly improved prediction performance of Cryptosporidium level presence, with 65% accuracy. The approach presented in this study can address the challenges of limited and time-delayed microbial water quality information and can be used to improve risk-based management and monitoring of water sources.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

Cluster is formed using containers which are provisioned based on the configuration provided as per application need. The environment has its own distributed cluster using physical machines to launch these containers. The dynamic allocation of containers provides the flexibility for clusters but does not ensure the processing of multiple requests at the same time due to resource limitations. It is difficult to figure out which request has to get the resource in terms of memory, GPU and CPU and which can be avoided due to shortage of resources. This paper describes a priority queue-based framework which is internally based on an algorithm to schedule the resource allocation incoming requests to the containers required to execute high performance computing (HPC) applications. It behaves like a priority-based scheduler to schedule resources allocation. Higher-based priority request will first get the requested resources. Request with same priority will be considered based on request submission time. It is implemented to provide a high performance computing environment to have the solution for allocating the required computing resources to containers and ensure that critical applications with higher priority will get the computing resources. The proposed framework will allocate the resources to containers in a well-balanced environment. The performance has been evaluated and compared with existing algorithms and scheduler.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

This chapter conducts a comprehensive review of the literature on the strategies for agricultural carbon sequestration and GHG emissions reductions and their economic feasibility. A general lesson from this review is that carbon sequestration and GHG emissions reductions in agriculture is potentially attractive, depending on the environmental conditions, socioeconomic contexts and strategies analysed. Various agricultural strategies have been identified as appropriate measures to increase carbon sequestration and/or reduce GHG emissions, including conservation tillage, crop rotations, continuous cropping, residue retention, improved fertilisation, and afforestation. Adopting conservative tillage and continuous cropping might be economically feasible, while the economic feasibility for crop rotations varies across regions. Studies on the economic feasibility of improved fertilisation and residue retention provide mixed findings. The economic variable costs of afforestation in developing countries are relatively lower than the costs in developed countries. More considerations of co-benefits should be integrated into relevant climate policies. We need to further improve our recognition and understanding of the policy-making of agricultural climate policies, thereby substantially increasing their effectiveness and robustness.","['Energy', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Sustainable Development', 'Climate, general', 'Fossil Fuels (incl.

Likewise, consultants and contractors are also attempting to be the most competitive in the market to get more business. Nevertheless, the scarcity of skilled labor and increasing material costs due to inflation are inevitably pushing construction costs up and forcing the industry to live with minimum possible profit margins. Therefore, the construction industry is in dire need of finding creative ways to lower overall construction costs, to not only align with project owner goals, but to also improve the bottom-line without impacting negatively on-time project deliveries. In the coming years, economists foresee a sizable surge in construction volume and a potential deficit of skilled workers, which obviously calls for the industry to pay higher wages to secure the right people, which means there will likely not be a way for the industry to lower costs in the human resources category. Therefore, the industry may be left with only the option to investigate more creative and modern ways of acquiring project materials to generate hard and soft cost savings to lower the overall cost and consequently improve profit margins. Researchers on construction procurement topics have already done a significant amount of work that is focused on refining conventional acquisition processes and pinpointing the right time to involve critical suppliers on individual projects in order to help with balance of projects (BOP) design, to minimize rework, and to improve schedule and labor productivity by ensuring timely material deliveries to the job site in order to realize some soft cost savings. Since very limited research has been done in the context of lowering material costs, there is an opportunity to study techniques with the potential to shift cost-saving approaches from conventional to world-class and to reposition the materials management function from individual projects to programs and from programs to portfolios with the intent to consolidate commodities and leverage enterprise-wide buying power.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

Simplified models of the interaction between the shaft and the bearing, between which there is a gap, are proposed for discussion. A design diagram has been drawn up that describes the main forces acting on the end of the shaft inside the bearing. The mode of motion of the shaft is described when its contact with the bearing is maintained for some time, i.e. the shaft is pressed against the bearing. A comparison is made of the modes of shaft movement with absolutely rigid and elastic bearings. A mathematical model of the motion of the shaft, in which it does not have contact with the bearing, is proposed. The resulting system of equations is solved numerically. An algorithm for constructing the movement of the shaft with separation from the bearing is described. The case is considered when the shaft is unbalanced, i.e. its center of inertia does not coincide with the center of rotation. The possibility of the occurrence of parametric oscillations and the occurrence of the phenomenon of parametric resonance has been proved.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Mechatronics']"

So, the action of these relays is bypassed for power swing conditions. Distance relays are equipped with features like power swing blocking and out-of-step operation functions to deal with such situations. Although, the fault in the presence of the power swing can be identified, but to detect the faults when power swing is present in a series compensated line is quite problematic because of the issues related to effects generated by the series capacitor and its protection aspects. This paper introduces a technique that uses the sum of negative sequence and zero-sequence voltages to identify the faults in the presence of the power swings in a series compensated line. Various types of faults like fault involving single phase or two phases or all the phases incorporating high fault resistance are simulated using this technique in MATLAB from the data generated by simulating the system in EMTDC/PSCAD to test the proposed technique.","['Engineering', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Energy Systems']"

Overall, the chapter argues that the policies of the Hungarian government reflected the populist political agenda of the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán. He used the pandemic (1) to further accuse the domestic opposition and the EU with acting against “the will of the Hungarian people”, (2) to further weaken the system of checks and balances through the adoption of a controversial “special legal order” to avoid hurdles in carrying out “the will of the people”, (3) to initiate policies which discriminated against opposition-controlled municipalities (i.e. “the undeserving non-people” in populist terms) and (4) to claim once again that the government represented “the people” as it listened to their voice expressed in National Consultations on pandemic responses and re-opening strategies.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Comparative Politics']"

Power Swing Blocking (PSB) function installed with distance relays prevents unwanted tripping. However, if a fault occurs amidst power swing, it must be detected and cleared. In a line with series compensation, fault detection at the time of power swing is challenging. The available techniques fail to detect fault in a line with series compensation. In this paper, a cumulative sum of zero-sequence and negative-sequence current is used to detect fault amidst power swing in a line with series compensation. The cumulative sum of zero-sequence component and negative sequence component helps in determining nature of fault along with the fault detection.

The deep learning architectures are expected to represent features automatically instead of feature extraction by human labor, and the transfer learning gives an approach to further increase the model generalization ability in different scenarios. First, a few-shot fault diagnosis method using deep belief network and continual learning is introduced to solve the issues that limited monitoring data are available to train the intelligent fault diagnosis model. Second, a method transferring knowledge from the laboratory to the real cases is presented for an extreme condition, i.e., none training data is available. Third, a deep partial transfer learning strategy is provided to promote the success of knowledge transfer when the required diagnosis knowledge is less than that provided. Fourth, when unknown fault condition exists in the testing scenario, instance-level weighted adversarial learning achieves the success of diagnosis knowledge transfer. The methods are demonstrated on diagnosis cases of industrial robots, locomotive bearings, gearboxes, etc. They come up with possible solutions to applications of intelligent fault diagnosis to engineering scenarios with respect to industrial big data.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements']"

In the last few years, to accurately identify web robots, machine learning classification methods were used. However, it was discovered that the multiclass distribution in the web robot detection system is substantially skewed due to the data set's class imbalance, which causes problems with classification accuracy. The research presented in this paper examines not only the role of feature selection in improving classification accuracy but also addresses the issue of class imbalance using under-sampling of major classes and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) of minor classes. After that, the classification performance is compared across a number of different classifier types. The results of this study show that oversampling (SMOTE) is more effective than under-sampling at discovering minor classes when employed with the class imbalance data set. Additionally, it was discovered that KNN and XGBoost are more accurately classified than other classifiers throughout this research. However, no single method can be utilized to classify multiclass data. This study proposes that a combination of KNN and XGBoost may be used to classify minor classes in a web robot detection system's unbalanced class data set.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Management']"

Many commercial applications also offer a wide range of shaded services. Owing to rapid increase in the usage of the internet, rapid access has also been the factor to the prosperity of the industry. Different services are built within the virtualized resources of cloud computing that allow us to perform the abstraction of the underlying resources. It offers flexibility, high capacity, and an ecological service-oriented mindset. In this work, algorithm development solves resource utilization, performance degradation, and availability issues. This problem requires an almost unlimited number of tasks assigned to cloud resources that are solved in polynomial time. The proposed Stochastic Bandwidth Allocation with Swam Optimization (SBA-SO) framework for dynamic network-based resource scheduling algorithms provides scalability and reliability by providing better resource utilization and minimum response times during migration. User requests arrive at the data center as bandwidth, response time and throughput quality check different parameters based on the request. Additive-polling load analysis is introduced to estimate each cloud datacenter load to categorize overload server and under load cloud servers. Each cloud resource monitors the usage and updates into the cloud index table. When the cloud suddenly increases the load, it searches other load servers to allocate to the user. The Swam Optimization method using a memetic hyper-heuristic algorithm is used to construct the network topology and establish the communication between servers. Optimization algorithms are also suitable for solving individual problems and can be used for managing cloud computing resources and scheduling resources.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

Resource conservation and increasing the level of resource efficiency in the use of hydrocarbon raw materials are priority issues, the solution of which will help to implement a set of energy, environmental and economic tasks for the transition to “green” development. Increasing resource efficiency will have a positive impact on the environment, as reducing the consumption of raw materials will significantly reduce waste and emissions. In the context of the growing shortage of non-renewable resources, the aggravation of environmental problems, the introduction of resource-saving and resource-efficient innovative “green” technologies aimed at the production of new types of “green” products is a necessary condition for the successful development of the economy and the preservation of the environment. In this regard, it is necessary to achieve the effect of “decoupling”, which implies an increase in the resource efficiency of the use of raw materials while reducing environmental risks. The most important direction of Russia's transition to “green development” is to increase the complexity of the use of raw materials, increase the depth of processing, processing and disposal of by-products, production waste through their recycling.

The experienced team from Sweden, Denmark, and Norway have collaborated for many years with early years teachers and the early childhood education and care (ECEC; i.e. in these national contexts, preschool/kindergarten) sector in their efforts to respond to societal problems alongside practitioners. Enhancing meaningful practices in the ECEC sector by creating relevant academic knowledge for and within this sector is a policy expectation in response to the wicked problem of societal problems. In the effort to do so, our experience is that even if this effort is rewarding and new knowledge is created and practices are transformed, a range of tensions occur already from the start of new projects, and we encounter problems we cannot solve as they lie outside our immediate responsibility. Additionally, collaboration can risk violating the standards of research and the traditions of education. This chapter draws on examples from Part II of this book (Wallerstedt, Brooks, Ødegaard & Pramling, this volume). While the projects reported on vary in pedagogical themes, sites, and participants, they share a participatory research design in their efforts to respond to challenges and develop practices while undertaking research. The chapter first elaborates on the nature and challenges of wicked tensions and problems and thereafter identifies some of the tensions and problems reported. The aim of the chapter is to articulate the tensions and problems on a meta-level for further efforts of partnership research. The vision for knowledge development entering practices-development research from the reported projects is clear and similar across the projects. The common vision is to nurture practices for long-term knowledge gains.

The use of “passive” and “active” (“zero static pressure chamber” together with “fan-closers”) ways to increase the efficiency of ventilation systems have led to different indicators in the consumption of electrical energy. Therefore, it was necessary to estimate the cost of electricity and the total discounted costs. A one-time investment for an active impact solution is 3.5% more expensive than a standard design practice solution. The combined use of the “zero static pressure chamber” and “fan-closers” is cost-effective, and the system is quickly recouped compared to the estimated equipment life of 20 years, and the non-discount payback period was 2.7 years. When designing branched air ducts, you should leave the branches with approximately the same aerodynamic losses. On the floor branches, it is advisable to use “fan-closers”.

The idea of DMAPF is to decompose a given MAPF problem into smaller sub-problems, then solve them in parallel. It has been shown that DMAPF can achieve higher scalability compared to centralized methods. This paper addresses two problems in the previous works. First, the previous works only divide problem maps in a simple, rectangular manner. This can create sub-problems with unbalanced numbers of locations in their maps when the shape of the original map is not rectangular or when the obstacles are not uniformly distributed. Having sub-problems that vary in sizes diminishes the effectiveness of parallelism. Second, the idea of DMAPF is to have agents move across sub-problems until they reach the sub-problems that contain their goals, but the previous works do not have a mechanism to regulate the number of agents residing in the sub-problems, thus it may fail to find the solution when a sub-problem is overcrowded. To mitigate the problems, we introduce ( i ) a method to decompose MAPF problems with balanced numbers of vertices; and ( ii ) a mechanism to regulate the number of agents in sub-problems. We also improve the performance of the Answer Set Programming (ASP) encoding, that was used in previous DMAPF implementations to solve MAPF sub-problem instances, by eliminating unnecessary parameters. The results show that the new solver scales better and is more efficient than the previous versions.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The efficiency of COVID-19 diagnosis has become highly significant. As deep learning and convolutional neural network (CNN) has been widely utilized and been verified in analyzing medical images, it has become a powerful tool for computer-assisted diagnosis. However, there are two most significant challenges in medical image classification with the help of deep learning and neural networks, one of them is the difficulty of acquiring enough samples, which may lead to model overfitting. Privacy concerns mainly bring the other challenge since medical-related records are often deemed patients’ private information and protected by laws such as GDPR and HIPPA. Federated learning can ensure the model training is decentralized on different devices and no data is shared among them, which guarantees privacy. However, with data located on different devices, the accessible data of each device could be limited. Since transfer learning has been verified in dealing with limited data with good performance, therefore, in this paper, We made a trial to implement federated learning and transfer learning techniques using CNNs to classify COVID-19 using lung CT scans. We also explored the impact of dataset distribution at the client-side in federated learning and the number of training epochs a model is trained.

But, it is an important aspect to study the difference in IS456 concrete model from the Hognestad’s one. Another objective is to find the reasons for adopting under-reinforced section. In this analysis, 106 samples of beam were analyzed and compared using the analytical model built in MATLAB R2020a and interpreted using MS-Excel. Parameters considered are percentage of tension and compression reinforcement, concrete’s characteristic strength, yield strength of steel and two concrete models which are IS456-2000 & Hognestad’s. This study helps understanding the fundamental behavior and effective usage of the reinforcing material by making the comparison between Hognestad’s and IS456-2000 concrete stress–strain model. Analytical analysis indicates that the under-reinforced section gives largest margin in ultimate curvature giving constant moment capacity. Comparison shows that adopting doubly reinforced beam enhances the margin from failure and makes the design economical by increasing moment capacity. Presence of compression reinforcement prevents the brittle failure of beam by making compression part of the section stronger.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics']"

One research question was clarified: which performance measurement dimensions related to the hospital’s sector can be observed in the existing studies? The process involved a systematic literature review of 48 studies formed on the basis of rigor, clarity, and trustworthiness. For the first time, we systematically reviewed the 8 Performance Measures (PMs) for the dimensions of the Performance Measurement System Framework (PMSF). The PMSF allows academics to obtain a basic understanding and conduct additional future studies in the area of PMSs in hospitals. Regarding the results of this research, it has been determined that a more thorough approach to PMS in hospitals is required. This research is also useful in that it offers knowledge to decision-makers who are considering using a PMS.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Sustainable Development']"

Therefore, it is necessary to create a learning environment that will motivate students to learn engineering professions. It is necessary to use all possible resources, as well as stimulate and encourage the creativity of both teachers and students. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to create a method for increasing motivation based on the use of new tools and approaches in training future engineers. Since virtual reality technologies allow a deeper understanding of real processes’ essence, demonstrate the main steps of the process and possible critical situations use of these technologies are very relevant. We put forward the assumption that the process of developing educational content itself can be used as an incentive motivating force in the educational process. We have developed virtual reality laboratory, with the help of which students are able to study the work of stands used in vehicle repair. They can master structure and operation principles of the balancing machine, study and practice of the technological process of balancing vehicle tires and disks. In order to maximize usage of students’ and teachers’ creative, it was proposed to attract computer students to develop the content of a virtual reality laboratory for the study of vehicle repair processes. A survey conducted among students showed that this approach allows to get a higher motivation level compared to the use of traditional teaching.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

However, training these models requires an increased amount of resources, which are limited, thus, the reuse of ML models becomes of paramount importance. Given that we do not have a pool of models to choose from, is it possible to determine which nodes in the network require distinct models and which of them could be reused? In this paper, we propose a solution to this question, an online model reuse framework which is evaluated for its precision and speedup. The framework considers all possible combinations of pairs in the network to determine which are good reusability pairs, by adopting statistical learning methods. Then for each pair, the node model is chosen that has the highest data space overlap. Our comprehensive experimental analysis in the context of both regression and classification shows the feasibility our solution in model reusability in Edge Computing environments.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Increasing the enormous amount of generating data through big data platforms and the use of IoT devices connected via the network have exploited the computational power of the cloud. However, the high utilization of the cloud leads to a longer execution time for a specific task. This paper proposing the hybrid strategy of scheduling the workflow in cloud computing called Genetic Algorithm with Differential Evolution (GA-DE). This research aims to investigate how heterogeneous cloud computing affects workflow scheduling. This study is aimed at reducing makespan and verifying if the metaheuristic technology is more suitable for the distributed environment by comparing it to existing heuristics, such as HEFT-Downward Rank,HEFT-Upward Rank,HEFT-Level Rank, and meta-heuristic algorithm GA. The proposed algorithm is validated through extensive experiments compared to three scientific workflows (Epigenomics,Cybershake,and Montage). Based on the simulation result GA-DE algorithm proves its superiority against the other comparing algorithms in term of makespan. Furthermore, the conducted experiment proves that montage scientific workflow is more proper for executing workflow scheduling in heterogeneous cloud computing.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This article considers the mechanical system of dispensers, discussing technological features and disturbing effects on the dosing process. Our findings indicate significant oscillation of the batcher weighing system during the loading process, determining the ways of increasing the dosing accuracy and explaining the fundamentals of the arrow movement of the quadrant dial pointer while loading the hopper. The dynamics of the balancing mechanism of the weighing mechanical lever system of the batcher is based on the equation of free vibrations and the oscillatory motion of the dispenser weighing system is determined by Rayleigh formulas. Expressions for movement of the dispenser weighing system and dynamic error are obtained. Taking into account the construction of the weighing system of the dispenser used in the production of concrete mixtures, the frequency of natural oscillations of the mechanical system was calculated.Results are obtained for the dynamic dosing error in the case of undamped movement of the weighing system and in the case of viscous critical damping.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Mechatronics']"

As per academic studies and media articles, it escalated during the COVID-19 outbreak. Domestic violence can portray verbally and physically in several ways (for instance, between partners or against children and older people). Deep Learning (DL) combined with the Internet of Things (IoT) technology could support the detection of domestic violence, which is one of many societal issues. This paper describes a system that uses a Deep Learning model and smart microphones to identify domestic violence. The datasets used are from the Google AudioSet (GA) and from the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS). For the training of the dataset, the system used spectrograms and MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients). The system employs two approaches: (i) an ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model, and (ii) a ResNet model. The Resnet model obtained an accuracy of 71%. The ANN model, which brought an accuracy of 83%, was tested and loaded to a Raspberry Pi, i.e., connected to the microphone for audio recording. The recorded audio was fed to the trained model, classifying the audio, and alerting the domestic violence to relatives, friends, or volunteers registered with the system via e-mail.

It is well known that sensor scheduling is an important mechanism that helps densely deployed wireless sensor networks save energy. On the other hand, geographic forwarding is an efficient scheme for wireless sensor networks as it requires maintaining only local topology information to forward data to their destination. Most of geographic forwarding protocols assume that all sensors are always on (or active) during forwarding. However, such an assumption is unrealistic for real-world applications where sensors are switched on or off (or inactive). This chapter describes our cover-sense-inform framework for connected k - covered wireless sensor networks, where k- coverage, sensor scheduling, and geographic forwarding are jointly considered. Based on our work on connected k- coverage, which is discussed earlier in Chap. 5 , we propose the first design of geographic forwarding protocols for duty-cycled k -covered wireless sensor networks with and without data aggregation. For the case of planar wireless sensor networks, this chapter discusses a few protocols that exploit the geometry of the configurations, which result from our connected k -coverage protocols, and the concept of virtual potential fields. For the case of spatial wireless sensor networks, it discusses our composite geographic forwarding protocol, which uses a combination of deterministic and opportunistic schemes to forward sensed data towards the sink. Moreover, it shows various simulation results of the proposed geographic forwarding protocols and compares them against others.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks']"

Emission control catalysis (ECC) is one of the most efficient and cost-effective end-of-pipe technologies for reducing emissions. The application of electrochemical promotion of catalysis (EPOC), especially that achieved through alkaline conductors (alkaline-EPOC), has been found to be extremely effective in ECC-related reaction systems. Its use made it possible to decipher the role and mode of action of alkaline promoters on these reactions, thus enabling the successful transfer of the obtained knowledge to the design of highly effective and simple, alkaline-promoted conventional catalyst formulations (alkaline-CPC), readily applicable in exhaust gas systems. Catalytic performance improvements by up to two orders of magnitude have been achieved on representative ECC-related reactions (e.g., deNO x ) via alkaline-EPOC and/or alkaline-CPC application.

The gains still fall short of the rate of increase needed to achieve universal access to electricity by 2030, indicating the need to increase the effectiveness of the multi-pronged approach. To do this the paper applies the triple embeddedness framework theory. Within the scope of Eastern Africa, we consider actors in the delivery of electricity access (irrespective of approach or whether public or private) as delivering similar goods and services, and conceptualize them as a collective entity i.e., firms in the electrification industry. The paper then analyses how these firms are shaped by the industry regime and influenced by the socio-political and economic environments, with a view to identifying where and how external pressure can be exerted to stimulate and facilitate the reorientation and recreation required to make progress towards universal electricity access. Through this exercise we demonstrate that the triple embeddedness framework provides a structured way of laying out the key aspects associated with electrification to create a picture that enables one to ‘see the forest for the trees’ and identify where and how to achieve more effective complementarity between on and off-grid approaches, and public and private firms.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Natural Resource and Energy Economics', 'African Politics', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'International Relations']"

It is governed by a multi-sectoral Protected Area Management Board (PAMB) with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources regional director as its chairperson and the Protected Area Management Offices of Regions XI and XII in Mindanao, Philippines, acting as its secretariat led by a protected area superintendent (PASu). In the latter part of the twenty-first century, the MANP has faced two major disasters; these are the Mt. Apo Fire Incident of 2016 that decimated 116 hectares of brushland in its strict protection zone (SPZ) near the peak and a landslide that has affected a major transportation artery and several local communities in 2019. This study aims to measure the level of disaster preparedness of the governing Protected Area Management Board with the descriptive analysis of its current polices such as the MANP General Management Plan (2013–2023) and the disaster preparedness plans of selected local governments as mandated by RA 10121 (Disaster Preparedness Act of 2009) and RA 9729 (Climate Change Act of 2009) and the Ancestral Domain Sustainable Development Plan (ADSDPP) of the unified Bagobo-Tagabawa Tribe in MANP. The study will outline recommendations with the purpose of formulating strategies for the enactment of improved board policies leading to improved disaster planning, management, and recovery for the Mt. Apo Natural Park. Mt. Apo Natural Park is an ASEAN heritage site, an active stratovolcano, and the highest peak in the Republic of the Philippines at 2954 MASL.","['Business and Management', 'Sustainability Management', 'Social Policy', 'Natural Hazards', 'Climate Change Management and Policy', 'Environmental Law/Policy/Ecojustice']"

For this book, a specific model and structure for presenting the scientific material were adopted that would be logical and allow the presentation of as many data as possible about the history of witchcraft in Romania. The selection of the bibliography used throughout the different chapters was a difficult task, due to the inevitable renunciations it imposed on the authors, but this sacrifice was necessary: we had to choose only the works that shed light on specificities of Romanian witchcraft in relation to Western European phenomena. This book should be used as a working tool, meant to provide useful information for a most accurate and comprehensive mapping of witchcraft in South-Eastern Europe and, as such, it may find its place in libraries alongside other similar volumes.","['History', 'European History', 'Cultural History', 'Social History']"
doi:10.1007/978-981-19-1061-6_4,en,Using the STP-EX Model for a Screening Level Assessment of Chemicals of Emerging Concern During the Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant Process,OriginalPaper,"Chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) can potentially flow through Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants (MWTPs) into receiving water bodies leading to human exposures and negative ecological impacts. However, throughout the multiple sequential MWTP processes, these CECs may be subjected to various removal mechanisms, including volatilization, sorption, and degradation (mostly biodegradation, but also may include photodegradation). The determination and quantification of these removal mechanisms in situ for MWTPs is difficult/impossible; thus, MWTP environmental fate models have been recognized as useful tools for studying and predicting the fate and transport of CECs through MWTPs. These models use both MWTP plant parameters (e.g., flow rates, solids concentrations, tank volumes, etc.) and CEC physico-chemical parameters (e.g., solubility, molecular weight, etc.) to determine CEC mass balances and fates. The current study uses the STP-EX model for the determination of partitioning maps using ‘typical’ activated sludge-type, facultative lagoon, and aerated lagoon MWTP process parameters. The partitioning maps are presented based on the octanol–water (Log K ow ) and air–water (Log K aw ) partition coefficients, which were varied incrementally from 1 to 9 and 2 to −9, respectively, creating a 9 × 12 grid ‘chemical space’ representing potential chemicals of interest. Using these partitioning based maps, biodegradation was then included in the model using ‘recalcitrant’ chemical biodegradation rates ranging from 100 to 25,000 h and ‘readily biodegradable’ chemical biodegradation rates ranging from 1 to 250 h. Generally, the impact of biodegradation was found to be highest for the activated sludge-type MWTPs (especially at low Log K ow values), while volatilization and sorption to solids dominated the facultative lagoon and aerated lagoon chemical fates with marginal impacts of biodegradation in low Log K ow value ranges. For further understanding of the partitioning maps, case studies were considered for five chemicals of interest (di-2-Ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), fluoranthene, toluene, cyclooctane, and dimethyl phthalate (DMP)) which are presented to discuss their fate and transport both with and without inclusion of either ‘recalcitrant’ or ‘readily biodegradable’ biodegradation rates.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

Many neural networks obtain outstanding results from visible spectrum devices for human activity and event detection, such as fall detection, object detection or pose estimation. However, these state-of-the-art neural networks are trained in datasets that do not contain thermal images, so their performance on them is not good. The main objective of this work is human body recognition and segmentation from thermal cameras. For this purpose, we propose ThermalYOLO, a neural network based on the YOLO neural network and fine-tuned with thermal images. For the generation and auto-labelling of the thermal dataset, an IoT device with two cameras, a visible camera and a thermal camera, is used. Therefore, the user does not have to manually annotate the dataset. As a result, ThermalYOLO outperforms YOLO in thermal images from two different smart environments.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In lieu of these unintentionally performed services, the pollinating insects are rewarded with their food (pollen and nectar) by the flowering plants they visit. The International Community has recognized the importance of pollinators as an element of agricultural diversity supporting human livelihoods. The insect pollinators play a major role in global food production, which makes them a key element of crop production all over the world. The bees form the most important group of pollinators; however, different kinds of insects, such as flies, beetles, weevils, butterflies, moths and wasps are also important pollinators of several crops. To ensure a reliable source of pollinators, both managed and native, a more comprehensive strategy for management of crop pollination is needed. Several insect species are known for their use in managed pollination systems of important crops. This chapter covers and discusses the co-evolution of angiosperms and insect pollinators, types of pollination and pollinators occurring in the nature, types of insect pollinators and their diversity, impact of insect pollination on the crop production, importance of insects as pollinating agents for managed pollination, major insect pollinators of different crops and effects of managed pollination on native ecosystem with conclusive remarks on the importance of conserving pollinators for a brighter future of the crop production.","['Life Sciences', 'Zoology']"

Since the 1990s, the city has been experiencing rapid urbanization. The encroachment issues have started degrading the river Vaigai and system of water holding tanks called the Vandiyur tank cascade system ( VTCS ). Due to limited holistic hydrological understanding of the region, conservation efforts at VTCS have limited efficiency. To increase understanding of the regional hydrology, this study analyzed normal and actual annual rainfall for the district based on the 50 years of IMD data (1969–2018). The LULC change was studied using remote sensing images from 2002 to 2018. Results indicated that rainfall, with an average percentage departure of 22%, recorded an overall reduction of 11.2% during N–E monsoon and 10.6% during S–W monsoon. Using aerial imagery, a rapid increase in the urban catchments, up to 330%, and the curve number, up to 86%, was recorded in peri-urban and urban catchments. As a result of this, water availability in VTCS was observed to be highly fluctuating (5 to 100%). Field investigation further revealed that about 30 to 70% of the total volume of the tanks was occupied by the silt and muck deposited either from the upstream tanks or due to sewage discharge. Subsequently, the practice of tank-fed agriculture became limited to one season from previously two or three seasons. Reviving VTCS was the most pressing recommendation discussed that would possibly provide scope for holistic ground-surface water management.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes']"

First, kinematics, a general dynamic model of the system consisting of manipulators and the object, is inferred about the position and direction of the object as the states of the derived model. Second, an FTSMC method is designed, followed by the construction of two RBF systems: one approximates uncertainties and external disturbances, and the other estimates the force applied to the object according to the object’s uncertainty model. Next, the Lyapunov theory is employed to demonstrate the stability of the closed-loop system and derive the adaptation laws for RBF NN. Finally, simulation results of the dual-arm robot system with three degrees of freedom (3-DOF) manipulators are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Electrical Engineering']"

With this chapter, the authors wish to achieve recognition for Indigenous knowledge as both critical and substantial for intervening in the decolonisation of social work studies that is currently underway. Decolonisation is a process through which those pained and hurt by colonialisation are enabled to voice or express their worldviews, narratives, and stories for analysis, education, research, governance, etc. in their own way. The field of Indigenous knowledge has gained traction, and many scholars have started to embrace its importance in their research and teaching and learning. The chapter considers the field of Indigenous knowledge with the aim of advancing social work practice, teaching, and research. The authors define both fields and demonstrate how these fields could benefit from crossing paths for the advancement of the social sciences with reference to appropriate examples taken from actual lived experiences. For this purpose, the authors used the Afro-sensed approach, which was developed within the Indigenous knowledge paradigm of reflection and enquiry. The authors explain their stance on the use of the Afro-sensed approach and perspective in this case. The Afro-sensed approach argues that African contexts and spaces present unique opportunities in the discourse of knowledge development. While the authors acknowledge the nomothetic characteristics of knowledge, they also realise the importance of its idiographic perspective. In this case, a balance is struck between universal and specific aspects of knowledge development.","['Education', 'Education, general', 'Social Work', 'Social Work and Community Development', 'Ethics']"

The goal of food security is to increase food availability for the population, resulting in a healthier and more favourable imbalance between food demand and supply. Recent advances in food technology, plant breeding, and genetic engineering have enabled places around the world to have enough food, resulting in a reduction in undernutrition and the growth of obesity and non-communicable diseases. Because functional foods can help to alleviate these issues, there is a need to produce more of them in order to ensure that they are used more efficiently and equitably as part of a complex and integrated worldwide plan for global functional food security. Thus all national as well as international agencies should collaborate to educate the global food business and governments about the importance of increasing the production of functional foods. Such attempts to buy or produce have not been made in middle-income countries, resulting in an obesity epidemic, which must be addressed across Africa to prevent obesity. Functional Food Security appears to be sufficient to treat all aspects of global malnutrition, including undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight, obesity, and diet-related National Sustainable Development Strategies (NSDS). This chapter contains a comprehensive view of the kinds of functional foods, their utility as a tool to mitigate nutritional deficiencies and achieve the SDG3 of good health and well-being, their use from a global perspective, and their role in the alleviation of food insecurity.","['Chemistry', 'Food Science', 'Food Microbiology', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-12034-3_9,en,Governance of Outsourcing Projects,OriginalPaper,"Although the outsourcing industry has demonstrated impressive growth during the past few years, some outsourcing relationships have yielded poor results, and some have even been terminated early. Both the professional press and academic publications have identified poor governance as a primary factor in these outcomes. For our purposes governance can be defined as specifying and enacting the decision rights and accountability framework that encourages desirable behaviour when outsourcing IT and business services (Willcocks, Global business: Management . SB Publishing, 2021a; Journal of Information Technology, 36 (2), 188–194, 2021b). After looking at 881 global companies, Joshi et al. ( Decision Support Systems, 153 , 113668, 2022) report that firms with IT governance processing capability, specifically the ability to identify, design, implement, and leverage IT decision-making, IT planning, IT infrastructure modernisation, IT service delivery, and IT monitoring, can significantly improve IT performance, and ultimately enhance business performance. This underpins the long-standing finding of Weill and Ross ( IT governance . Harvard Business Press, 2004) that firms with superior IT governance have more than 25% higher profits than firms with poor governance, given the same strategic objectives. Recent research confirms this to be the case for modes of outsourcing governance as well (Lioliou & Willcocks, Global outsourcing discourse: Exploring modes of IT governance . Palgrave Macmillan, 2019; Oshri et al., Journal of Management of Information Systems, 36 (4), 1248–1283, 2019; Krancher et al., Journal of the Association of Information Systems, 21 (1), 2022). One interesting dimension is that contracting for steady state delivery of services versus innovation requires different governance arrangements and relationships (Oshri et al., Relational and contractual governance for innovation. In L. Willcocks, I. Oshri, & J. Kotlarsky (Eds.), Dynamic innovation in outsourcing . Palgrave Macmillan, 2018). Another is that governance through strong relationships may take time to build and might not be a good way to start contracting for outsourcing (Lioliou & Willcocks, Global outsourcing discourse: Exploring modes of IT governance . Palgrave Macmillan, 2019). A further dimension is whether the structure of the client organisation is centralised, federal, or decentralised. In this respect, Weill and Ross ( IT governance . Harvard Business Press, 2004) found that if profit is the strategic goal, then a centralised governance structure is most effective. With an asset utilisation target, then a blended structure is better, while if looking for growth, a business should adopt a more decentralised governance structure. Outsourcing governance works best when it mirrors organisational structure (Miranda & Kavan, Moments of governance in IS outsourcing: Conceptualising effects of contracts on value capture and creation. In L. Willcocks, M. Lacity, & C. Sauer (Eds.), Outsourcing and offshoring business services . Palgrave Macmillan, 2017; Lioliou & Willcocks, Global outsourcing discourse: Exploring modes of IT governance . Palgrave Macmillan, 2019). The inexorable trend towards cloud sourcing—according to a 2022 MarketsandMarkets report, the cloud computing market is expected to grow from US$148.8 billion in 2019 to US$246.8 billion by 2023—is bringing additional governance factors into play (see Chap. 3 ). Our focus in this chapter is therefore understanding governance issues related to traditional outsourcing and the practices that support formal structures. In particular, we review the following issues: The governing structures for outsourcing ventures The roles involved in governing outsourcing relationships The most effective governance practices for outsourcing relationships.","['Business and Management', 'Operations Management', 'International Business', 'International Economics', 'Organization', 'Business Strategy/Leadership', 'Market Research/Competitive Intelligence']"

To date, phase separation has been identified as the main driving force for a membraneless organelles such as nucleoli, Cajal bodies, stress granules, and chromatin compartments. Recently, the protein-RNA condensation is receiving increased attention, because it is closely related to the biological function of cells such as transcription, translation, and RNA metabolism. Despite the multidisciplinary efforts put forth to study the biophysical properties of protein-RNA condensates, there are many fundamental unanswered questions regarding the mechanism of formation and regulation of protein-RNA condensates in eukaryotic cells. Major challenges in studying protein-RNA condensation stem from (i) the molecular heterogeneity and conformational flexibility of RNA and protein chains and (ii) the nonequilibrium nature of transcription and cellular environment. Computer simulations, bioinformatics, and mathematical models are uniquely positioned for shedding light on the microscopic nature of protein-RNA phase separation. To this end, there is an urgent need for innovative models with the right spatiotemporal resolution for confronting the experimental observables in a comprehensive and physics-based manner.

Firms’ reactions to concerns about sustainable development can minimize risks, boost positive impacts, and benefit society, markets, and ecosystems. Even though the SDGs were designed for governments and not for the private sector, businesses’ greatest contribution to the 2030 Agenda is incorporating ESG components into their strategy and therefore scaling up and accelerating SDG implementation. The private sector must be more responsive to the long-term development needs of each location where it directly operates, as well as the needs with downstream or upstream value chain implications. While businesses are stepping up to help achieve the SDGs, acceleration is needed. The world is rapidly changing and problems may intensify. As a result of such changes, businesses must rely on innovation and technology to achieve the SDGs. It is also important that firms measure and demonstrate their contribution toward this achievement. Though a company may have the individual resources to meaningfully contribute to society and the environment, a corporation can only sustainably do so in collaboration with other businesses, CSOs, or the government. When the private sector collaborates with national and local governments on long-term growth and value creation, the result will be much more effective. During the first year of COVID-19, with the added influence of the climate crisis, there was an increased need for corporations to form strong public–private partnerships with national and local governments, as well as engage in private–private alliances with other enterprises and entrepreneurial endeavors. Progress in the private sector is critical to the 2030 Agenda. Businesses not only shape the market, but also the state and society. Governments, civil society, firms, investors, and consumers must jointly collaborate in achieving global and local goals relating to the SDGs.","['Business and Management', 'Corporate Environmental Management', 'Governance and Government', 'Sustainable Development']"

This chapter identifies the relationship of critical computer resources to various workload categories. Low-level hardware measurements can be used to distinguish job transitions between categories and within phases of categories.

Most of the existing literatures are not suited for energy depletion due to indeterminacy in selection of cluster heads and uneven distribution of sensor nodes in WSN. The optimized clustering in presence of noisy and border lying sensor nodes is the main disadvantage while using the standard energy hole alleviation algorithms. This paper improves the process of alleviating void hole occurrence in WSN by devising a wedge-based partitioning to distribute the sensor nodes evenly. The standard Fuzzy C-Means algorithm’s efficiency is low when dealing a huge volume of traffic with limited memory. Another difficulty is how to optimize Fuzzy C-Means clustering is a major challenge and it is achieved by integrating MapReduce framework to improve clustering reliably. The MapReduce based Fuzzy C-Means clustering is developed in this research work to determine the optimized cluster head in presence of indeterminacy due to the dynamic nature of the environment and mobility of sensor nodes. Hence, it can perform parallel clustering of sensor nodes to improve the speed of the algorithm. Additionally, security is also considered as an important factor to accomplish better energy consumption in WSN. This proposed work introduced a deep neural network-based trust management scheme to overcome the issue of data packet loss and time delay. The simulation results proved that the proposed Empowered MapReduce and Deep Trust Management (EMR-DTM) with its ability of tristate mechanism greatly overcomes the problem of energy depletion and secure data transfer more precisely compared to other standard state-of-the-art clustering algorithms in WSN-IoT.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Structures and Information Theory']"

Consequently, ELG provides a habitat for various kinds of innovation and a home for the necessary community to put innovation into action. The marketplace is essential for attracting participants supplying and demanding services, resources, components and technologies on a European scale. Innovation and marketplace – as well as the overall business model – are tightly connected and need to be developed and managed in a joint manner. Clearly, this is not a one-off activity, but rather needs to be carried out continuously and extend into the future. ELG is designed and created to promote the excellence and growth of the European LT market, creating new jobs and business opportunities and supporting European digital sovereignty. Encompassing a wide array of technologies and resources for many languages spoken across Europe and in neighbouring regions, it contributes to the Multilingual Digital Single Market as a cross-European driver for innovation.","['Computer Science', 'Natural Language Processing (NLP)', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Knowledge based Systems', 'Computer Applications', 'Computer Science, general']"

In the 1960s and early 1970s he was the leader of Guiné-Bissau and Cabo Verde’s movement for independence from Portuguese colonial domination. Intellectual and political activity was central to his life, in which he sought always to tie together knowledge and social action. This chapter focuses on the writings of Amílcar Cabral on agriculture, soil erosion, mechanization and colonialism, covering the period between 1949 and 1955, which has been less researched, but which prepared the ground for the flourishing of the second phase. His thought and academic work in the field of agricultural engineering includes various articles on Cabo Verde, the work he did to complete his undergraduate degree, and the texts he wrote when he worked as an engineer in Guiné-Bissau. These texts show how Cabral consistently drew attention to the limitations of technological mastery of the land, mainly apparent when that mastery disregards the particular features of the cultural contexts in which it is applied and the fact that it increases the power of some men over others. Even before the social sciences had as yet not incorporated the notions of sustainable agriculture, risk and uncertainty, Cabral discussed the implications of importing the new technologies of industrial societies into Black Africa. This form of discourse, which encompasses contextual knowledge, protection of the land, careful technological choices and social development, stands out forcefully in the writings of Amílcar Cabral the agronomist.","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy of Technology', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'History of Technology']"

Studies in different animal groups have shown that this process is mediated by a population of intestinal stem cells (ISC) that can self-sustain over extended periods and potentially differentiate into enterocytes, goblet cells, enteroendocrine cells, and paneth cells. More than 300 million new epithelial cells must be produced per day in the small intestine to compensate for the high cell death rate in the villi, so cell losses in the tissue must be balanced by the proliferation Proliferation of stem cells Stem cell . While the decrease in the intestinal stem cell population causes tissue dysfunction, excessive stem cell proliferation may cause tumor formation. Autophagy Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that maintains cellular homeostasis by degrading long-lived proteins and damaged organelles in the cytosol. At basal levels, autophagy removes damaged components that threaten cellular homeostasis. It is also a particularly important mechanism that performs functions ranging from providing metabolic nutrients to cells under starvation stress to defending against microbial attacks. Autophagic mechanisms are highly active in ISCs and are critical for the survival and function of these cells. Deficiencies in autophagy in intestinal stem cells are associated with various pathological conditions such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, and gastrointestinal cancers. Understanding the roles of autophagy in the survival, stemness, proliferation Proliferation , and differentiation Differentiation processes of intestinal stem cells Stem cell is important for elucidating the cellular mechanisms of gastrointestinal diseases and for the development of new treatment options.","['Biomedicine', 'Cancer Research', 'Cell Biology', 'Developmental Biology']"

Therefore, urban regeneration is pursued by taking into consideration that the social, economic, environmental and institutional dimensions of a city are made fully sustainable. Although experiences of urban regeneration worldwide demonstrate that it is quite impossible to achieve, by equal measures, levels of sustainability in all dimensions, nevertheless, they demonstrate that practices of urban regeneration have the same rationale. The relationship between physical restoration and social renovation stands as a priority objective of urban regeneration policies that have developed in both large metropolitan areas and smaller communities. From this point of view, urban regeneration processes include actions of social innovation also aimed at re-characterization of espace vecu, i.e. the relationship between people and the spaces in which they act to meet certain needs. Initiatives of urban regeneration must have a ‘bottom up’ approach, underpinned by partnerships between key local players, hence, and are area-based. That means that urban regenerative actions gather a wide range of ambitions and activities of a social character directed to the community living in areas characterized by socioeconomic challenges. By this perspective, area-based regeneration stands as an umbrella term with a socio-economic and environmental focus.","['Energy', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Regional/Spatial Science', 'Archaeology']"

The proposed solution is based on static analysis of raw opcode sequences from disassembled programs and other complementary features such as API calls and permissions, with features indicative of malware automatically learned by the network. This removes the need for hand-engineered malware features while performing classification. Using the Drebin and AMD benchmark datasets, the benefits of this multi-view architecture to combine multiple feature sources are demonstrated in our findings. We conclude the use of deep learning architectures enables state-of-art results in automatic malware detection, while reducing the dependency on feature engineering and domain expertise. Using multi-view compared to single-view architectures improves performance through exposure to simultaneous sources of information, learning a more effective set of features. The model achieves state-of-the art detection performance in a challenging zero-day scenario, reducing false positives by 77% in relative terms on average, an important metric for potential real-world deployment.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Privacy', 'Cryptology', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

Since their description in numerous angiosperms and gymnosperms in the two decades from the 1860s, there has been little research into the functions of these enigmatic structures. Their cage-like organisation led to speculation that phi thickenings mechanically strengthen the root, but more recent ideas include that they regulate biotic interactions or control ion movements in a manner similar to the Casparian strip. There is, however, sparse direct evidence supporting these suggestions. In this review, we focus on the roles that phi thickenings might play within roots, and although we conclude that the primary function of phi thickenings is to mechanically stiffen the root apex, we emphasise that phi thickenings need not have a single role and that they can be “re-tooled” to perform other functions. We describe several experimental systems for studying phi thickening functions. Geranium and Pelargonium roots, in which phi thickenings form in cortical cells immediately under the epidermis, are well suited for cell biology investigations, whereas the large aerial roots of epiphytic orchids are ideal for investigating root biomechanics. For genetic analysis, however, the differential induction of phi thickenings in Brassica roots in response to water stress or hormones provides a powerful experimental platform to identify regulatory mechanisms and directly test our models of phi thickening functionality. Since phi thickenings typically form in the root apex, we propose that these structures function primarily to strengthen or stiffen the plant root. We reject the concept that phi thickenings function to block ion flows in a manner analogous to the Casparian strip, but instead see the potential for limiting ion flows within the root cortex as drawback to the presence of thickenings. This negative outcome due to the presence of phi thickenings may explain why phi thickenings are only induced in response to specific biotic or abiotic challenges in some species and are not formed constitutively. In some instances, however, phi thickenings may have been “re-tooled” to perform other roles including blocking uptake of ions, notably in the case of Brassicaceae species growing under extreme conditions.","['Life Sciences', 'Plant Sciences', 'Forestry', 'Plant Biochemistry', 'Ecosystems', 'Plant Genetics and Genomics', 'Plant Physiology']"

However, very often, and especially in recent decades, rivers are brought into the context of danger to humans, either in the event of high waters or because of their increasing pollution. Human development, population growth, urbanization, and climate change, are just some of the causes that have led to a significant decline in river health globally. The importance of preserving the quality of watercourses, and preserving the amount of water, is gaining weight, especially after the realization of the lack of it for many human needs. Unfortunately, water pollution is increasing day by day. Industries and households discharge their wastewater into rivers, household waste is usually dumped directly into it, and various chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which are mostly used unplanned in agriculture, are filtered into groundwater and surface water. Hydrotechnical facilities in the riverbed significantly change the natural water regime and the sediment transport regime, which in turn has an irreversible negative impact on aquatic ecosystems.

In conjunction with local impacts such as fishing, eutrophication or the invasion of alien species, to give just a few examples, the acidification of the oceans and the warming of the sea began to show its effects more than twenty years ago. These signals were ignored at the time by the governing bodies and by the economic stakeholders, who now see how we must run to repair the huge inflicted damage. Today, different processes are accelerating, and the thermodynamic machine has definitely deteriorated. We see, for example, that the intensity and magnitude of hurricanes and typhoons has increased. Most models announce more devastation of flash floods and a decomposition in the water cycle, which are factors directly affecting ecosystems all over the world. Important advances are also observed in the forecasting of impacts of atmospheric phenomena in coastal areas with more and more accurate models. Rising temperatures and acidification already affect many organisms, impacting the entire food chain. All organisms, pelagic or benthic, will be affected directly or indirectly by climate change at all depths and in all the latitudes. The impact will be non-homogeneous. In certain areas it will be more drastic than in others, and the visualization of such impacts is already ongoing. Some things may be very evident, such as coral mortalities in tropical areas or in the surface waters of the Mediterranean, while others may be less visible, such as changes in microelement availability affecting plankton productivity. In fact, primary productivity in microalgae, macroalgae and phanerogams is already beginning to feel the impact of warmer, stratified and nutrient-poor waters in many parts of the planet. Nutrients are becoming less available, temperature is rising above certain tolerance limits and water movement (turbulence) may change in certain areas favoring certain species of microplankton instead of others. All these mechanisms, together with light availability (which, in principle, is not drastically changing except for the cloudiness), affect the growth of the organisms that can photosynthesize and produce oxygen and organic matter for the rest of the trophic chain. That shift in productivity completely changes the rest of the food chain. In the Arctic or Antarctic, the problem is slightly different. Life depends on the dynamics of ice that is subject to seasonal changes. But winter solidification and summer dissolution is undergoing profound changes, causing organisms that are adapted to that rhythm of ice change to be under pressure. The change is more evident in the North Pole, but is also visible in the South pole, where the sea ice cover has also dramatically changed. In the chapter there is also a mention about the general problem of the water currents and their profound change do greenhouse gas effects. The warming of the waters and their influence on the marine currents are also already affecting the different ocean habitats. The slowdown of certain processes is causing an acceleration in the deoxygenation of the deepest areas and therefore an impact on the fragile communities of cold corals that populate large areas of our planet. Many organisms will be affected in their dispersion and their ability to colonize new areas or maintain a connection between different populations. The rapid adaptations to these new changes are apparent. Nature is on its course of restart from these new changes, but in this transitional phase the complexity and interactions that have taken thousands or millions of years to form can fade away until a new normal is consolidated.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"

Unstable nuclei are formed in nuclear reactions, which can occur either in hot and dense extremes of stellar interiors or explosions or from cosmic-ray collisions. In high-energy astronomy, direct observations of characteristic gamma-ray lines from the decay of radioactive isotopes are important tools to study the process of cosmic nucleosynthesis and its sources, as well as tracing the flows of ejecta from such sources of nucleosynthesis. These observations provide a valuable complement to indirect observations of radioactive energy deposits, such as the measurement of supernova light in the optical. Here we present basics of radioactive decay in astrophysical context, and how gamma-ray lines reveal details about stellar interiors, about explosions on stellar surfaces or of entire stars, and about the interstellar-medium processes that direct the flow and cooling of nucleosynthesis ashes once having left their sources. We address radioisotopes such as 56 Ni, 44 Ti, 26 Al, 60 Fe, 22 Na, and 7 Be 56 Ni, 44 Ti, 26 Al, 60 Fe, 22 Na, and 7 Be , and also how characteristic gamma-ray emission from the annihilation of positrons is connected to these.","['Physics', 'Astrophysics and Astroparticles', 'Astronomy, Observations and Techniques', 'Particle and Nuclear Physics', 'Cosmology']"

Hence there is immense demand of high-rise structures which has created a need for unconventional efficient structures. The need shows a potential solution to this problem which is increasing the height of the structures using different techniques like outrigger structures and tube in tube structures. The structural efficiency of high-rise structures heavily depends on the lateral stiffness and resistance capacity. The paper aims to review various researches done on outrigger and tube in tube structures. Performance of the structure under lateral loads like wind and earthquake loads as well as various parameters like story displacement, story drift and story shear are reviewed. The review will be helpful to researchers in the modelling of outrigger and tube in tube structures.","['Materials Science', 'Structural Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

It was first reported in Wuhan, China in 2019. It was discovered recently that COVID-19 disease can be detected using three main protocols. The first protocol is based on Polymerase Chain reaction (PCR), while the second protocol is based on lung chest (ultrasound, X-ray, and CT-Scan), and the final protocol is based on the ECG image reports. This review aims to present a survey on the methodologies and algorithms applied for the detection of COVID disease using electrocardiogram (ECG). In this study, various papers were presented for determining how the COVID can be diagnosed using ECG image reports relying on symptoms and changes in the ECG peaks and intervals. In addition to this, other studies are presented on techniques applied to the ECG reports for the detection of COVID. Also, the main limitations and future works are illustrated. It can be concluded that COVID can be detected with high accuracy using ECG reports and it is even more efficient than other protocols. Finally, based on the performance of the studies it can be shown that the ECG image report is close to an acceptable level in the detection of COVID disease.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

By discussing the various definitions of the family business, this paper presents the attribution of this type of business model toward the sustainability of cultural heritage in this country. The broader perspective from various literature has been compiled, and it showed the significance of family business activity in heritage management. This study aims to explore general guidance for navigating critical modelling decisions to develop a business foundation in the family business and transgenerational entrepreneurship related to heritage management. The essence of business foundation in family business usually involves the dimension of simple business organisation or ‘smallness’, survivability, resilience and mobilise in economic factors and competitive succession. In this context, family business research has undertaken considerable efforts to understand better continuity and succession and how existing businesses set their foundation in businesses primarily related to heritage-based tourism products in Malaysia. To capture and explain how families bring new transgenerational entrepreneurship, streams of values to their heritage tourism-based business activities to survive and prosper across many generations were investigated. Based on critical reading of previous literature, the existing theoretical foundations are discussed briefly. In conclusion, tourism activities may offer a powerful strategy for preserving tangible and intangible cultural heritage and at the same time enhanced family business-related. Family business involvement in heritage tourism nurtures its growth and makes it more sustainable for a more extended period.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

The MM operation principle is due to its chosen method: either a device for generating a control servo signal for the machine CNC system or a mechatronic power converter. In the first case (generating a control servo signal), the MM generates an unbalance servo signal which represents the required (according to the machining technology of the part) dependence of the force-torque parameters on the path traveled (along the CNC program trajectory) with adjusting the feed from the CNC machine system. In the second case (power converter), the MM works independently of the machine CNC system, maintaining communication with it. An example of a one-dimensional servo automatic control system is considered for the operations of drilling holes and forming grooves when diamond grinding inscriptions and patterns on the surface of parts, including parts made of superhard materials. During multidimensional machining of complex-profile surfaces (turbine blades, impellers, implants, etc.), the MM is embedded in CNC machines’ corresponding coordinate electric drives. In addition to adaptive control of the axial force and cutting torque, the developed MM design can take into account other signals (other than axial force and torque) generated by the monitoring system of the CNC machine for intelligent control.","['Engineering', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Engineering Design', 'Materials Engineering']"

It employed a mixed-method design as the data were collected through pre and post-test and semi-structured interviews. The pre and post-test of reading skills were analyzed through t-test, and the qualitative data were analyzed through thematic patterns. The findings showed a significant difference between the pre and post-test of reading skills, and the qualitative data analysis showed that face-to-face CACL has academic, social, and cognitive advantages. These findings showed that face-to-face CACL effectively teaches reading skills, which is attributed to the design of CALL and the implementation of cooperative learning principles. It is concluded that CALL and cooperative learning have a complementary advantage in teaching reading skills through face-to-face CACL. Therefore, teachers need to focus on the learning theories of CALL activities and implement the five principles of cooperative learning to make teaching reading skills through CACL more effective for EFL learners.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering']"

One of Ricoeur’s themes is his attempt to render Freud’s unconscious and the substitution of satisfaction relevant to hermeneutics by eradicating Kant’s distinction between explanation and interpretation. Another motif is Ricoeur’s collection of Marx, Nietzsche and Freud under the notion of a hermeneutics of suspicion, declaring consciousness a false surface juxtaposed to the reality of the unconscious. The chapter takes issue with Ricoeur’s preference of Frege’s paradigm of sense and reference to Husserl’s hermeneutically more fertile, expanded meaning chain, Ricoeur’s analysis of structuralism and semiology , as well as his writings on narrative for their neglect of literariness and the subtleties of the presentational process. While Ricoeur rightly dismisses truth conditions in hermeneutics, he fails to acknowledge the original source of this insight in Kant. Strengths in Ricoeur are shown to be his accent on the emancipatory hermeneutics and his contribution to the study of metaphor. The chapter concludes on Ricoeur’s Gadamer-inspired flight from Kant as an unjustified denial of the relevance of the Critique of Judgment to hermeneutics.","['Philosophy', 'Continental Philosophy', 'Hermeneutics']"

Lioliou and Willcocks ( Global outsourcing discourse: Exploring modes of IT governance . Palgrave Macmillan, 2019) noted in their case studies that managing outsourcing has remained a problem for many, and this continues to the present day, with the difficulties heightened by increasingly volatile business contexts and fast-changing technologies and services. Events in 2020–2022 have only served to increase uncertainty around global supply chains. According to the findings of a study of outsourcing arrangements by Lacity and Willcocks ( Nine keys to world class business process outsourcing . Bloomsbury, 2015), up to 15% were poor, some 40% were probably ‘doing OK’ (marginal cost savings delivered, acceptable service performance, marginal client satisfaction), while 25% experienced ‘good’ performance (cost savings delivered, service level agreements (SLAs) met, good client satisfaction). Looking at more recent research by Willcocks ( Global business: Management . SB Publishing, 2021a; Journal of Information Technology, 36 (2), 188–194, 2021b), probably only 20% of outsourcing arrangements can be called ‘best-in-class’, providing cost savings, improved services, delivering business benefits and innovation, and high client satisfaction. Poor management and governance of the outsourcing relationship have often been cited as primary reasons for less successful outsourcing contracts. But before we investigate the management and governance of outsourcing relationships, which will be further discussed in Chap. 9 , it is important to understand the key stages of the outsourcing process, as well as the key practices that can be applied at each stage. This chapter discusses the outsourcing life cycle. In doing so it provides a checklist of key activities a client organisation needs to fulfil to prepare and properly execute an outsourcing relationship, whether this be domestic, offshore, nearshore, or cloud sourcing. Fortunately, the outsourcing life cycle, and the requirements for managing it effectively, remains constant across settings and relatively stable in its stages. This chapter also elaborates on the key requirements for designing and executing the transition phase. We therefore focus on the following aspects: The key stages of the outsourcing life cycle The most effective practices available for clients to cope with challenges throughout the entire outsourcing life cycle The key requirements for executing the transition phase.","['Business and Management', 'Operations Management', 'International Business', 'International Economics', 'Organization', 'Business Strategy/Leadership', 'Market Research/Competitive Intelligence']"

Western culture has significantly challenged Chinese traditional culture and social norms, which have been dominated by men. Influenced by Western feminism, Chinese feminists fought to emancipate women and greatly improved Chinese women’s social status during the twentieth century. However, in the twenty-first century, witnessing the problems of previous feminist movements, which any human endeavors could not avoid, the globalized patriarchal world does not wait for feminists to find a solution but have a strong backlash against feminism. In China, misaligned with the rapid economic development, Chinese women’s rights have significantly rolled back to serve men’s interests in the twenty-first century. The double portion of the cultural constraints from both traditional Chinese and modern Western cultures provide Chinese women with both greater challenges and greater opportunities. On one hand, a Chinese woman should not make herself a bigger foot-binding cloth in her mind by internalizing the intersectionality of globalized patriarchal cultures; on the other hand, she should not follow the misleading information from the mass media to be manipulated as woman tools to make great leaps to serve patriarchal and capitalist interests. Surviving and succeeding in the double portion of the cultural constraints of a globalized world, Chinese women leaders have developed a double portion of wisdom from both traditional Chinese and modern Western cultures. If Western women leaders are like iron ladies with assertiveness, Chinese women leaders are more like water ladies with gentleness, flexibility, and fortitude. The hard iron could be broken by harder cultural constraints. Dripping water hollows out stone ( di shui chuan shi ) through persistence instead of force.

The limitation of the CGAN or ACGAN framework stands in putting too much emphasis on generating series and finding the internal trends of the series rather than predicting the future trends. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach on conditional GAN based on deep generative models that learns the internal trend of historical data while modeling market uncertainty and future trends. We evaluate the model on several real-world datasets from both the US and Europe markets, and show that the proposed HybridCGAN and HybridACGAN models lead to better portfolio allocation compared to the existing Markowitz, CGAN, and ACGAN approaches.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

What is surprising is its overwhelming role in business and social decisions and, sometimes, the incredible propensity of individuals and organizations to ignore this fact. Against the backdrop of increasing economic sophistication and ever-expanding risk exposure, particularly to high impact risks, it is of paramount importance to understand and rigorously manage the inherent uncertainty in practically every action we take. This chapter begins modeling risk not as an individual-level attribute (as with risk preferences derived from a utility function) but rather as a systemic property that needs to be understood and governed at a systemic level. To this end one can heavily rely on probability theory and a set of well-understood metrics but also never substitute it for sound reasoning.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Data Engineering']"

Traditional crowdsourcing approaches are significantly different from the queries posed to the audience for urban planning concerns. Since numerous components are available (e.g., a number of facilities) within a single query and as well as unavailability of correct ideal answers for ranking the population, this model differs from standard crowdsourcing methods. Due to conflicting characteristics, traditional ranking procedures, like the method of Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), are not the best solution for multiple goals against criteria for conflicting cases (utility, cost, etc.). It is not always practical because it is not possible all the time to find an optimal solution for all the objectives at the same time. Furthermore, very limited research has been performed to provide proper weighting schemes to deliver all possible rankings from constrained crowd opinions to the decision-makers. Hence, we provide an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)-TOPSIS-based integrated model for the solutions used to find the best way for ranking the population. Finally, a multi-objective strategy is presented in this paper in order to create better compromised solutions concerning competing characteristics solutions gathered from the crowd. The experimental findings are compared to state-of-the-art TOPSIS models utilizing a crowdsourced data set for actual urban planning challenges, and the experimental findings indicate the approach’s efficacy.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

Under monetary constraints, the economic policy choice among Japan’s conventional growth strategy, distribution, and fiscal discipline creates trilemma, where the government can pursue only two of these three goals. In this election, the LDP-Kōmeitō coalition managed to straddle between distribution and growth strategy, while exploiting policy space for the opposition parties. Although the coalition maintained the electoral majority, the inroad made by Ishin, Reiwa, and the Democratic Party for the People whose campaigns neglected fiscal discipline in favor of both growth and distribution foreshadows the challenge against the Japanese government’s future fiscal health.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Electoral Politics', 'Asian Politics', 'Political Communication']"

Data for the study was collected from secondary and primary sources. The secondary data were collected from the Palestinian SAIs’ annual and the interim specialized reports from year 2011 to 2020. Moreover, the study employed the questionnaire survey to know the perception of the CPAs who licensed and in the public practice of the audit profession in Palestine on the role of the SAIs on the audit quality in the municipalities, in order to support the result of the analysis of the SAIs audit reports. The study uses SPSS Software 20 in order to analyze the collected data by the questionnaire. The study finds that the SAIs have a medium impact on the relationship between the audit quality and the effective internal control components, as well as the auditors’ characteristics, but SAIs have weakness impact on the audit firm’s attributes. The findings of the study may help the policymakers in the municipalities, SAIs, profession regulators, and the audit firms to consider the impact of auditing of SAIs on external audit quality in the municipalities when they decide on the audit engagement’s agreement and audit process. Moreover, the study opens the doors to the academic researchers to examine effect of SAIs on the relationship between the audit quality and other audit quality attributes and use other research methods.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

In magnetic recording, optical domain, radio frequency identification, and for Visible Light Communication (VLC) the Miller decoder is utilized. Two Miller decoders proposed in this paper. The proposed Miller decoders constructed using digital circuits like D-flipflops and few logic gates. Proposed Miller decoders used D flipflops, logic gates of AND gate, OR gate, XNOR gate and inverters. Whereas the existing Miller decoders used both analog and digital circuits like Phase locked loop, Oscillators, Filters, amplifiers, counters, multiplexers and few logic gates. It means proposed miller decoder circuits are simple in construction and occupies less area when compared to the existing circuits. The proposed designs used less number of blocks because of that power is decreased which is confirmed through simulation and it offers a simpler design with reduced transistor-count. CMOS 180-nm technology on Cadence-platform was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed circuit. A simulation result shows that the power, delay and PDP are better in proposed Miller Decoder-2 when compared to all other designs.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes']"

doi:10.1007/978-981-19-7100-6_14,en,Impact of Anthropocene on the Fluvial Sediment Supply: The Mahanadi River Basin Perspective,OriginalPaper,"The Mahanadi River basin is the third biggest in central India and the longest in the state of Odisha. The peninsular river basin has a significant history of watershed land use changes and human disturbances in the channel. The Mahanadi Delta, located on India’s east coast, is a hybrid delta formed by water, suspended and bed sediments, and minerals from a web of distributaries of the Mahanadi River system. The current state of research on the quantification of river sediment supply and its connection to human catchment disturbances is discussed in this chapter, with an emphasis on the physical characteristics of the river basin. Nonparametric time series assessment methods are used to examine the annual runoff and suspended sediment characteristics of the gauging stations of the basin. The function of various attributes influencing runoff and suspended sediment dynamics of the gauging stations is also investigated. The average correlation between the discharge and suspended sediment load (SSL) is studied using sediment rating curves (SRC). Also, the role of differential supply of sediments from the watershed is characterized using the hysteresis analysis of suspended sediments. The development of the Mahanadi coastline subjected to the regulated sediment supply from the catchment in terms of land loss and gain is evaluated using geospatial data. The statistics of hydrological data reveal a large seasonal variance, with the monsoon being the most dominant. The annual SSL distributions are more irregular and non-normal relative to yearly runoff. The investigation of hysteresis loops revealed that the supply of sediments also significantly affected the transport capacity of all the channels within the basin. A substantial loss in SSL is evident throughout the majority of the stations in comparison to a negligible change in water outflow. Besides, 81% of the stations show a 2-year periodicity in runoff and SSL. Also, the flow of SSL to the ocean has fallen nearly three times more than the annual runoff, which is alarming. It, therefore, shows the strong impact of artificial force relative to natural variations. The statistical estimates for seashore morphological changes on a volumetric basis show that coastal landscapes prone to erosion are susceptible. The rating parameters vary inversely due to intense human-induced activities throughout the catchment. The rise in withdrawal over time for non-monsoon irrigation and hydropower generation is observed from the release of water from the reservoirs. The demand for thermal power stations has increased fourfold in the recent decade, significantly increasing water utilization. Overall, large impoundments, excessive water distribution across multiple business sectors, and varying watershed soil management efforts are highlighted as critical anthropogenic attributes impacting the decline in catchment sediment transport and eventually causing the delta to retreat. Further studies in the basin should focus on the impact of future land use on the sediment budget of the Mahanadi delta. This study aims to shed light on the dynamics of runoff and suspended sediment load over the past five decades and to fill in shortcomings about the evolving nature of rivers in the Mahanadi River basin.","['Life Sciences', 'Ecosystems', 'Ecology']"

Important examples are Vision Zero, continuous improvement, ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable), BAT (best available technology), cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, risk limits, and exposure limits. The error tolerance principles are based on the insight that accidents and mistakes will happen, however much we try to avoid them. We therefore have to minimize the negative effects of failures and unexpected disturbances. Safety principles telling us how to do this include fail-safety, inherent safety, substitution, multiple safety barriers, redundancy, and safety factors.

The crisis was caused by the termination of logistics operations as a result of lack of resources, as well as long delays in the supply of products from suppliers and logistics partners. The cardinal transformations which are taking place in the supply chains are also associated with the transition of all logistics operations to the digital environment. The purpose of the study is to develop a strategy for the formation of a sustainable supply chain that more comprehensive responds and effectively overcomes external influences. Redesigning of the global network, setting of the new parameters for supply chain buffers, and proactive supplier’s management are aimed to overcome external influences. Rapid response to emerging logistics chain failures is achieved through end-to-end supply management, the use of an artificial intelligence-based risk management system, and planning based on forecasting, modeling and scenario development. The application of the proposed strategy for the creating of a sustainable supply chain will improve the level and quality of customer service, increase the revenue and reduce risks through the cost savings.

Historically, adolescence is understood as a life stage in terms of its defining characteristics and features which gave it a sense of universalism and developmental predictability, largely drawn from a Euro-American lens. However, the discourse of the last three decades has questioned the universalistic approach by highlighting the role of culture, context, and diversity in determining the nature of adolescence. The key debates question whether adolescence is a biological or a sociocultural construct and whether there is a singular adolescence or several adolescences or in some cases, whether adolescence even exists. This chapter attempts to highlight and address these issues by building a kaleidoscopic image of adolescence as it is lived, experienced, and documented from an Asian Perspective. In the first section, research studies drawn from various regions in Asia examine issues related to universalism versus cultural relativity and consider questions of whether adolescence is a myth or a reality, an artifact of industrial societies, a stage marked by challenge and potential, and how it signals emerging adulthood. The second section discusses seven major developmental themes, including biological change, gender roles, self and identity, life-style choices, aspirations, media, and relationships, bringing out the nuanced specificities and generalizations across Asian regions and the world. The chapter concludes with insights that contribute towards planning educational experiences for adolescences in Asia.","['Education', 'International and Comparative Education', 'Education, general']"

Organizations have benefited from this practice by using ERGs to address workplace concerns, recognize diverse perspectives, and advance diversity and inclusion initiatives. This chapter describes how ERGs can also serve as an emancipatory strategy for marginalized, outnumbered, and/or excluded employees to practice advocacy and pursue social justice. In doing so, core principles of critical social theory and self-advocacy are used as a framework to examine the ongoing need for members of oppressed social groups (i.e., LGBTQ, persons with disabilities, women, and racial minorities) to incite social change for themselves and their communities. Research that identifies the unique challenges and objectives of different ERGs is also presented in a literature review. Thereafter, this chapter concludes with a discussion about how the field of human resource development (HRD) can further contribute to the development of ERGs and the advancement of social justice research.","['Business and Management', 'Human Resource Development', 'Diversity Management/Women in Business', 'Organization', 'Critical Theory', 'Social Justice, Equality and Human Rights']"

This chapter provides a typology and systematic overview of safety principles and an analysis of how they relate to Vision Zero. Three major categories of safety principles are investigated. The aspiration principles tell us what level of safety or risk reduction we should aim at or aspire to. Important examples are Vision Zero, continuous improvement, ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable), BAT (best available technology), cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, risk limits, and exposure limits. The error tolerance principles are based on the insight that accidents and mistakes will happen, however much we try to avoid them. We therefore have to minimize the negative effects of failures and unexpected disturbances. Safety principles telling us how to do this include fail-safety, inherent safety, substitution, multiple safety barriers, redundancy, and safety factors. Finally, evidence evaluation principles provide guidance on how to evaluate uncertain evidence. Major such principles are the precautionary principle, a reversed burden of proof, and risk neutrality.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

During the pandemic, the people experienced various restrictions and different problems were raised unlike before. While the people stayed in their homes, electronic device usage had a decisive spike. This increased time spent on the internet and the amount of misinformation followed the same trend. The problem with the information on the COVID-19 is that there are too many different sources presenting different data. While some are just trying to help and do not have the latest or the most accurate information, some sources are malicious. Either way, everything but the latest and the most accurate data needs to be filtered when regarding a serious matter as such. The research proposed in this manuscript is aimed to identify COVID-19 fake news by performing wrapper-based feature by using an improved version of the well-known firefly algorithm. Practical simulations were done against a well-known dataset used in the domain of this problem, Koirala.

Excessive vibration is one of the main causes of blade failure, which may affect the safe and stable operation of the equipment. Therefore, it is significant to detect and analyze blade vibration characteristics. Blade tip-timing (BTT) technology has the advantages of non-contact and simple installation, which is widely used in online blade vibration monitoring of turbomachinery. In this paper, the research of using BTT technology to measure the vibration characteristic parameters of the last stage moving blade of a steam turbine with integral shroud and snubber is carried out. Firstly, a finite element model of the last stage blade is built, the stress distribution and mode shape of the blade are obtained through simulation analysis. Secondly, the blade vibration measuring experiment is accomplished on a dynamic balancing test-bed, and the synchronous vibration parameters such as resonance speed are calculated correctly under lowing speed working condition based on BTT technology. Furthermore, the strain gauge method is used simultaneously to verify the accuracy of the measurement results. The resonance frequency and engine order of the blade are measured successfully. The analysis results show that parameters such as resonance speed identified by BTT method are consistent with that measured by strain gauge method. The research results prove the effectiveness of BTT technology in measuring the vibration parameters of the last stage blade with integral shroud and snubber, which can provide reference for design rationality verification and vibration characteristics detection of the steam turbine blade.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements']"

The network used in IoT is low power and lossy networks which is commonly known as LLN. The components in LLN use low power for its operations. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has defined routing protocol for standardized LLN, i.e., routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL). The RPL selects suitable path to reach the destination by constructing the destination oriented directed acyclic graph (DODAG). The DODAG can be constructed based on the type of objective function. RPL commonly uses two objective functions they are, MRHOF and objective function zero. The objective function zero uses hop count as its metric, and MRHOF uses the metric of expected transmission count. Hence, selection of the energy efficient objective function plays an important role to make the network of IoT more energy efficient. In existing research, the superiority of MRHOF and OF0 is experimented using only simulation not using the real testbed. Hence, it is essential to conduct the experiment in real testbed to identify the energy efficient objective function. Future Internet of Things (FIT) lab is a platform to carry out the large-scale experimentation using testbed. In this paper, two objective functions MRHOF and OF0 are considered, and experiments are performed in FIT IoT-Lab to identify the energy efficient objective function. After the experiment, it is identified that objective function zero is more energy efficient than MRHOF. From the results of simulation and real testbed experiments, it is concluded that OF0 consumes less energy than the MRHOF.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

One objective is to avoid direct mechanical irritation or insult to neural elements using spontaneous and triggered electromyography (EMG) to detect proximity of surgical instruments and implants. While an 8-mA threshold for pedicle screw testing remains the most prudent alert criterion, it should be adjusted based on patient factors such as bone porosity. A second objective is to alert the surgeon to possible evolving dysfunction. EMG and somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEPs) have historically shown relatively weak sensitivity in diagnosing spinal nerve root dysfunction during surgery, while motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) have demonstrated excellent accuracy when appropriate alert criteria and optimized anesthetic regimens are utilized.

Various applications of WSN are military, agriculture, monitoring or surveillance etc. As the SN are battery operated and power source cannot be replaced, so to maximize the network lifetime, energy-efficient protocols play a vital role by choosing some low energy path. The use of low energy path repeatedly may lead to exhaustion of battery of SNs in that area that will create energy holes as all the SN are dead in a particular region. So, the protocol must be chosen to prolong the network lifetime by involving all the SNs to participate in data transmission. Clustering proves to be an efficient approach for prolonging the network lifetime. In clustering, the strategy to involve all the SNs will provide efficient and balanced consumption of battery and increase the reliability as well. Various clustering techniques have been proposed over the years but still, there are chances of improvement. Clustering is an efficient approach for precision agriculture because it will provide lots of information to farmers about the field. Heterogeneous protocols are more reliable and energy-efficient than homogeneous protocols. A Heterogeneous Energy Efficient and Reliable Routing (HEERR), which is an advanced version of Distributed Energy Efficient Clustering (DEEC) protocol is proposed and compared with other hierarchical routing techniques.

This is the main concept of Internet of Things (IoT), which consists of intelligent devices connected together without location limitation. These devices can be sensors and actuators, which are used in environmental monitoring, home automation, disaster management and more. This is the definition of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), which is considered a subset from IoT environment. WSN consists of hundreds of nodes spread in different area for monitoring different physical objects, it suffers from highest energy consumption of nodes, which affect network lifetime. Different routing protocols are used to cope with this challenge, Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol is the most common used one. LEACH is a cluster-based micro sensor network protocol that offers energy-efficient, and scalable routing for sensor nodes. So, in this paper, we investigate and present a modified algorithm using LEACH in conjunction with K-means clustering approach in order to achieve a Full Connectivity Driven K-LEACH algorithm (FCDK-LEACH). Based on the CH selection, the k-means algorithm aids in decreasing energy usage and therefore extending network lifetime. The CH is chosen based on the remaining energy level and the CH’s position with relation to the sensor node. The evaluation results show that our modified k-means-based hierarchical clustering enhances network lifetime.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Identifying predictors for in-hospital mortality is an essential step toward MI prevention and consequent reduction in mortality. We aimed to develop machine learning (ML) methods for predicting in-hospital mortality in MI patients and apply novel techniques for models’ interpretability to detect the predictive importance of the variables. Random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) are applied to a dataset of 2035 MI patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. When comparing the models’ AUC (RF—0.9712 vs. XGB—0.9666) and accuracy (RF—97% versus XGB—98%), both techniques achieved similar performance. However, the RF model obtained a higher sensitivity (86%) than the XGBoost classifier (80%). Hypertension, cardiogenic shock, ejection fraction were identified as some of the main contributors to the outcome. Our paper contributes to the global effort of reducing mortality in patients with myocardial infarction by proposing two interpretable ML models that accurately predict in-hospital mortality in MI patients. These results are essential steps in improving current preventive strategies. However, future studies on larger datasets enriched with both categorical and continuous variables, and models validated on external data from other centers are needed to accurately assume generalizability in clinical practice.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Many of the previous studies have explored various factors, but not many put together corporate openness and compliance management in perspective. As such, this paper offers the concept as a foundation for improving innovation performance through openness and compliance management. Corporate openness is a key factor in the relationship of ambidexterity and innovation performance. Openness helps SMEs to gain access to external knowledge at minimal cost, and also understands competitor activity in the market thus helping SMEs to bridge the innovation gap between them, competitors and markets, with less time and cost. Compliance Management is a process to ensure companies and employees complies to all laws, regulations, ethical standards and practices applicable to organizations and industries. We argue that the absence of compliance with the laws, regulations, standards and ethical practices conducted by SMEs into the performance of innovation will be hampered. This is due to SMEs need to concentrate on resolving things that are obstacles to operationalization, then innovate after the problems are resolved. Therefore, compliance is needed in addition to corporate openness to improve the performance of SME innovation.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

The modeling results showed that the proposed control method is much better in terms of voltage quality and on the other hand it enhances the ability of the DVR to perform its task. .","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

However, there are cases in which Human experts are needed to label the data, which may have a significant cost in terms of human resources and time. In these cases, it is often best to learn on-the-fly, without expecting for the whole data to be labeled. Often, it is desirable to guide the Human annotators into focusing on the more relevant instances: this constitutes the so-called active learning. In this paper we propose an approach in which a clustering algorithm is used to find groups of similar instances. Then, the procedure is guided with the objective of favoring the annotation of the groups that are under-represented in the labeled dataset. Results show that this approach leads to models that are, over time, more accurate and reliable.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Additive manufacturing is being adopted widely by industries across the globe because of their potential ability to manufacture complex shapes economically and sustainably. However, for any manufacturing process to be cleaner and sustainable, material selection plays a vital role which considers appraising the material alternatives under the influence of often conflicting performance metrics. The present work therefore provides a systematic material selection framework for appraising the commercially available powders for one of the versatile additive manufacturing processes, i.e., selective laser sintering (SLS) process. The aggregation multiplicative rule (AMR) approach has been employed as a material selection framework that ranks sixteen commercially available powders for the SLS process under the influence of eight criteria: Young’s modulus [MPa], tensile strength [MPa], elongation at break, density [g/cc] , flexural modulus [MPa], flexural strength [MPa], Izod impact strength (notched) [J/m], and Izod impact strength (unnotched) [J/m]. The AMR approach considers the compromising attitude while appraising the material alternatives. Duraform GF was revealed to be the best ranked commercially available powder for the SLS process. The ranking results have been validated through the sensitivity analysis with respect to the criteria weights and the balancing factor ( λ ). The ranking results through the adopted material selection approach have been revealed to be stable. The presented material selection approach has been revealed to be robust and can aid in saving material wastage and hence the energy involved during early design phases of product development via SLS process.","['Materials Science', 'Structural Materials', 'Nanotechnology', 'Materials Science, general']"

Only a small proportion of events (symptoms, diagnoses, and treatments) are observed in the lifetime of an individual. The high degree of missingness of EHR can be attributed to a large number of factors, including device failure, privacy concerns, or other unexpected reasons. Unfortunately, many traditional imputation methods are not well suited for highly sparse data and scale poorly to high dimensional datasets. In this paper, we propose a graph-based imputation method that is both robust to sparsity and to unreliable unmeasured events. Our approach compares favourably to several standard and state-of-the-art imputation methods in terms of performance and runtime. Moreover, results indicate that the model learns to embed different event types in a clinically meaningful way. Our work can facilitate the diagnosis of novel diseases based on the clinical history of past events, with the potential to increase our understanding of the landscape of comorbidities.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

To address this issue, a clustering and cross-layer-based CH selection with data aggregation and compressive sensing scheme called (CLCCS) has been developed to maximize the lifetime in UWSNs. Initially, the network area is clustered using the K-means clustering technique, then the type 2 fuzzy logic (T2FL) algorithm is implemented to select the best Cluster Head (CH) candidate among the members in a cluster. The outcome of T2FL is the fitness score for each sensor node that is used for reliable route formation in intra- and inter-cluster data transmissions. Further, to minimize the energy consumption and communication cost at the CHs, the data reduction and compressive sensing (CS) mechanism are adopted. The proposed protocol shows its efficacy as compared to the state-of-the-art protocols in terms of energy efficiency, throughput, delay, packet delivery ratio (PDR) and network lifetime enhancement.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Attackers employ new techniques and methods to deceive the system and to take the most important information. An intrusion detection model is required to monitor wireless security breaches when the prevention methods in the preparation phase are passed. It is critical to have an automatic detection policy in place to respond to network threats as quickly as feasible. In this study, we propose a Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) based feature selection mechanism for wireless intrusion detection. The proposed mechanism utilizes the distance of FCM center point and data point, calculates the difference of normal and attack center distances, and adopts the distances to select the features. We evaluate the algorithm with the benchmark Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID), and the results show an impressive accuracy for the binary detection of flooding, impersonation and injection attacks.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Big Data', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering']"

While states retain their predominance in diplomacy, the assumed interdependence of the world, its globalization, the emergence of new non-governmental actors, and the growing complexity of modern issues require a new approach. Perhaps the main challenge of contemporary diplomacy is to find a right balance between old, traditional elements, and new, modern ones. Few international relations studies have ever highlighted the importance of network diplomacy. Yet the digitalization of the world and its transformation into a giant network, where communication is instantaneous and fast, leads us to ask new questions about global governance. There is a need to rethink the world in terms of networks, a more adapted way to seek better global solutions, and a more comprehensive, efficient decision-making process at the governmental level. This chapter analyses the main developments towards network diplomacy and the role it plays in broadening the scope of solutions to global challenges in a globalized era. It is based on history, on definitions, and on the work and opinions given by pioneer researchers on network diplomacy, who share their analysis of the theoretical implications of this new phenomenon.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Diplomacy', 'International Relations', 'International Organization']"

The “behavioral” perspective emphasizes the brain as doing the behaviors that flourishing people do. I spend more time fleshing out the “belief” perspective, which is the brain’s representions of ‘having flourishing.

In this paper, we have introduced seven different machine learning models to improve the results. Proposed framework has used principle components analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction of UCI-ML dataset. Results show that LDA is better than PCA. Kernel–SVM accuracy has increased from 95.39 to 96.23%. Naïve Bayes has shown 96.78% accuracy with dimensionality reduction. Simple dataset has shown low accuracy while dimensionality reduction has improved the performances of models. We have also introduced different challenges associated with machine learning models, fitness value, and future challenges. At the end of this work, we have done comparative study and error analysis of models.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Mobile and Network Security', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The tumor can be cancerous or non-cancerous. The cancerous brain tumor can spread to the breast, colon, lung, and kidney. Therefore, precise and appropriate detection of brain tumors is important to prevent loss of life. It is crucial to predict the size and location of the brain tumor. Many people lose their lives due to the time taken to diagnose the tumor’s presence in the brain due to such a complex structure of the brain. Thus, a model is required to detect the brain tumor in the reduced timeline. Due to the advancement in technology and image processing, Machine learning is capable to find probabilistic parameters. These parameters help to predict the insight of the image. In the research work, digital Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is used for image enhancement, and improved Otsu’s method is applied for the thresholding. Thresholding is applied to categorize the images in background and foreground. Five machine learning techniques- Logistic Regression, K-NN, Decision Tree, SVM, Naïve Bayes are applied to train the brain tumor detection model, among them K-NN technique performs better in comparison to other models. Five performance parameters: precision, accuracy, recall, F-score, and support are used to assess the effectiveness of the model. OpenCV library is used to perform the complete analysis.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Statistics, general']"

Delivering electrotactile messages using spatiotemporal patterns has been suggested as an efficient and reliable approach to transmitting information through the skin. However, the effectiveness of this approach depends on the user’s capability to recognize tactile messages in potentially challenging scenarios (e.g., rescue operations). Therefore, the present study evaluated the participants’ performance in identifying electrotactile messages while they performed a parallel cognitive task. Thirty-six electrotactile messages were delivered through a 3 × 2 pad-matrix at the lateral torso in the baseline and multitasking conditions. The task-switching paradigm was employed as the parallel task, introducing cognitive interference to the electrotactile message recognition. The assumption was that the simultaneous task would impair the identification performance, but that this impairment could be minimized by decreasing the speed at which the message was delivered. The results indeed showed that the identification success rates decreased from  ~83% in the baseline to ~61% during multitasking. Unexpectedly, the performance did not recover when the message duration was increased. Hence, modulating the message duration seems not to be an effective strategy to prevent lower performance while multitasking.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Machine Learning', 'Robotics and Automation']"

Entomotourism has emerged as a growing mainstream attraction for many tourists and insect enthusiasts. Work in this sector is less and sporadic due to the negligence for long time. At present scenario, a comprehensive study is an urgent need, to formulate conservation strategies and policies to conserve insects and boost insect tourism. Therefore, a thorough review on insects and tourism, its benefits and role in conservation has been elaborated. This sub-sector of ecotourism encompasses a wide range of insect-related entertaining activities, such as educational or multimedia entertainment, and insect encounters in controlled environments, such as butterfly parks, gardens and insectariums. Tourists all over the world may engage in activities, such as photography, observation, entomophagy, and other forms of direct interaction with various groups of insects. There are various butterfly parks, firefly parks, insect kingdom themed parks and beetle’s rooms present in India as well as in other countries. The butterflies’ parks have its huge attraction due to its colorful appearance and easy-common accessibility. All insect species are facing threat to their population due to native habitat loss, degradation and pollution. Coordination, alliances and partnership between various stakeholders along with better application of standard techniques would strengthen conservation strategies while implementing their coordinated actions could preserve insects’ future.","['Life Sciences', 'Zoology']"

The communal ‘atelier’ functioned as a repair workshop (Allemeersch et al. 2014 ) concerned with re-negotiating the relation and knowledge between the inside and outside world. Through a synchronic ethnographic report on the inside world of the housing ensemble, this article aims to characterize the lived citizenship (Warming and Fahnøe 2017 ) of residents, formal and informal, based upon the opposition between formal and informal order (Goffman 1966 ; Scott 1998 ), the notion of ‘underlife’ (Goffman 1963 / 1996 ) and hidden and public transcripts (Scott 1990 ). As the deserted stronghold of a previously ‘pillarized’ welfare state, this article pictures an inside world that is unbalanced between formal and informal order, and lacking the latter (Scott 1998 ). This results in a social closure between the inside and outside world, and the loss of self of residents. Essentially, residents are caught in the double bind between isolation and social closure (Wacquant 2008 ) on the one hand, and the loss of façade (Goffman 1959 / 2019 ) on the other.

Persons sentenced to life imprisonment in Japan may be paroled once they have served 10 years in prison and evince signs of reformation. However, the chance of parole is extremely slim. Fewer than 10 prisoners are released each year out of 1,800 serving life sentences. In the meantime, life imprisonment—especially life imprisonment without the possibility of parole (LWOP)—has often been discussed in the context of abolishing the death penalty. This chapter examines the existing sanction of life imprisonment and potential alternative sanctions to the death penalty from the standpoint of international and regional human rights standards. It concludes that the establishment of LWOP without reformation of the current life sentences, which offer very little possibility of parole, could bring about another form of despair in place of the death penalty.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Human Rights', 'Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law', 'Social Justice, Equality and Human Rights']"

As in many countries, also in Finland, the emergence of current counter media sites is closely connected to the rise of the anti-immigration movement, and immigration policies and immigrants have been targets of the massive social media disinformation and misinformation campaigns. By employing a nationally representative survey (N = 3724) from Finland, this study investigates how three social-media-related concerns addressing misinformation and disinformation are explained by political party preferences, media trust, and immigration attitudes. We found that the supporters of the populist party, the Finns, had more critical views on freedom of expression and monitoring of hateful content on social media. Moreover, they were less concerned with the flow of fake news on social media. Based on mediation analysis, we found that trust in traditional media and attitudes on immigration are lowest among the supporters of the Finns, which also explained their different views on fake news, freedom of expression and hateful content monitoring. Even though the independent variables were highly inter-correlated, they also associated individually with social media users’ perceptions. We argue that the accumulation of negative immigration attitudes and low trust in the media is reflecting attitudes towards social media among the supporters of populist parties. The results underline the populist right-wing communication strategy, which questions the reliability of mainstream media, undermines professional journalism, criticises political correctness, and appeals to those who are most frustrated with mainstream media and critical towards immigration.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Political Sociology', 'Political Communication']"

The decision-making agreement is also the cost of the window beyond its benefits. Marginal increase in cost will be offset by the savings in the energy consumption. The energy consumption saving is calculated using three star air-conditioner which is most widely used in buildings. In the recent work, novel configuration are experimented and introduced to have lower heat ingress and savings in energy substantially for composite climatic conditions. It has been observed that the minor and budget changes in the design of windows make them more energy effective. With the usage of recommended configurations in the building, it is projected to reduce the building energy consumption by 17.61%. The effect of configuration can save maximum of 15 watts per hour. It is recommended that buildings should be designed using these configurations to reduce the electricity bill and have the satisfactory energy efficiency level.","['Engineering', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Environment, general']"

According to the cognitive behavioral perspective, the undue influence of body weight and shape concerns can lead to abnormal eating practices, such as binge eating, frequent body checks, and subsequent compensatory behaviors. In the phenomenological perspective, the classic symptoms of bulimia nervosa, including the overvaluation of body shapes and weight for self-esteem, are epiphenomena of a deeper core nucleus represented by a disorder of the embodiment, which consists in an alteration of the way that people experience their own body and shape their personal identity. According to the optical-cenesthetic hypothesis, the embodiment disorder derives from a disproportion between the optical and the cenesthetic perception of one’s body, as a consequence of the interoceptive deficits that characterize patients with bulimia nervosa. As an effect of the incapacity to experience one’s body from within, patients with bulimia nervosa adopt a maladaptive coping mechanism focused on external means of self-definition, and the body becomes just an object that is looked at by others. The implications of embodiment disturbances regard not just eating behaviors but also many other domains of life in patients with bulimia nervosa, including the evaluation of time or space dimensions and sexuality. Beyond bulimia nervosa, embodiment disturbances were shown to influence body image concerns and sexuality in other clinical samples, as well as in the general population.","['Chemistry', 'Nutrition', 'Health Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology']"

With the help of EnergyPlus energy consumption simulation analysis software, the sample data can be generated by simulating the software. Thus, a three-layer radial basis function (RBF) neural network is used to train and learn the sample data, and the models of building energy consumption and indoor comfort can be established. The established energy consumption and comfort models are verified by the experiments. On this basis, NSGA-II multi-objective optimization algorithm is used to balance the building energy consumption and indoor comfort to obtain the value range of design parameters and the Pareto front. So, the optimization results can be used to guide energy saving architectural design.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Public Policy', 'Arts']"

Here, we evaluate horseshoe crab resource use across ontogeny (instars 14–18 and adults), sex, seasons, and between two spatially distinct populations that exhibit different migratory patterns. Multi-tissue stable isotope analyses of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur were used to examine (1) ontogenetic and sex-specific variability in the reliance of resource pools; (2) variation in isotopic niche breadth within and among populations; and (3) seasonal variability in resource use within juvenile life stages. We found evidence for subtle ontogenetic shifts in resource use, with increased contributions of phytoplankton with ontogeny, but all age groups predominantly relied on sedimentary organic matter (SOM) pools. Sex-specific differences in resource use were observed with SOM serving as the predominant source assimilated in males, while females exhibited a higher dependence on phytoplankton resource pools, indicating foraging or spatial preferences may be different between sexes. Low trophic niche overlap between adult and juvenile horseshoe crabs was evident, likely arising from differences in migratory patterns and size constraints. Within juveniles, no seasonal differences in resource use were observed, indicating that dietary patterns may remain static across temporal scales, consistent with limited dispersal of that life stage. Spatial differences in resource use were, however, observed between adult crabs likely reflecting the migratory strategies of different populations. Our results are consistent with previous evidence that horseshoe crabs are dietary generalists but provide novel insights into the linkages between movement and trophic patterns.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Freshwater & Marine Ecology', 'Environmental Management', 'Coastal Sciences', 'Water and Health']"

Drawing from many others who place identity as the central factor explaining the mutually reinforcing dynamics of protracted conflicts and protracted peace processes, this chapter suggests that the processes of identity building in protracted conflicts bear specific characteristics due to the multigenerational aspects of these contexts. The argument developed is that peace processes in this kind of conflicts tend to become protracted themselves, turning into a structure of their own that impact perceptions about the ‘self’ and the ‘other’, thus influencing the negative dimension of identity—the detachment or difference from others—and, therefore, the very behavior and interests of actors involved in the conflict. For this reason, identity and violence must be read as mutually constituted in the cases of historical conflicts, making it impossible to discuss conflict transformation without addressing the main categories of identity and violence, as well as their interconnectedness.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'International Relations', 'Political Science and International Relations, general']"

Quite contrary to common belief, it is shown that the axle characteristics can take into account many vehicle features, like toe-in/toe-out, roll steering, camber angles and camber angle variations. The steady-state analysis is carried out first using the classical handling diagram. Then, the new global approach based on handling maps on achievable regions is introduced and discussed in detail. This new approach shows the overall vehicle behavior at a glance. Stability and control derivatives are introduced to study the vehicle transient behavior. Moreover, the relationship between data collected in steady-state tests and the vehicle transient behavior are thoroughly analyzed in a systematic framework. To prove the effectiveness of these results, a number of apparently different vehicles with exactly the same handling are generated.","['Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Complexity', 'Control and Systems Theory']"

A complex characteristic of the success of the organization's business processes and management efficiency is financial sustainability. In the theory and practice of financial management general approaches to the analysis of financial stability, based on the study of the structure of capital of the organization, identifying the degree of financial independence of the business and the provision of reserves by own sources are recommended. Agricultural production has historically developed a capital structure with a predominant share of own sources and a high share of inventories in current assets, resulting in an inherently high degree of financial stability of the organization. But at the same time in economic activities can be fixed ups and downs in sales, net profit, return on capital. This in no way reflects the sustainability of the organization's development, its progressive economic growth. In the scientific study the methodology of analysis of financial sustainability of agricultural organization was proposed, the stages of which are based on the analysis of creditworthiness and evaluation of the effectiveness of agricultural production. The system of indicators of financial sustainability of agricultural organization is proposed for realization of the analytical task. Particular attention in this system is paid to the analysis of material and biological liquidity ratios, the monetary content of net profit and the impact of economic value added on the increase in equity. The implementation of the proposed methodology in practice is designed to provide a real assessment of the relationship between the financial stability of the organization and its economic growth, contribute to the validity of management decisions being developed.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Data Engineering']"

The efficiency and dispatchability of power generation from renewable energy sources can be increased using thermal energy storage (TES). Moreover, high-temperature latent heat storage (depicted as thermal battery) can provide cost-competitive solution to obtain significant energy storage density and small charging duration. This study illustrates the methodology to compare the performance of thermal batteries with existing Li-ion batteries. The charging duration of the designed thermal battery is found to be 23 min smaller than Li-ion cell with the smallest heat flux (625 W/m 2 ). Moreover, the gravimetric and volumetric energy density of the thermal battery is observed to be nearly four times higher than the selected Li-ion cell. This present study establishes the high-temperature latent storage-based thermal battery as a potential alternative to storage technology.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Solid Mechanics', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

In recent years, studies have sought to propose milk proteins as natural carriers for bioactive compounds and develop nanostructures containing these compounds. Although most bioactive compounds have beneficial effects on health, some limitations such as low solubility in aqueous media, low stability to pH and temperature variations, and low bioavailability have hampered their use. We carried out a systematic review analyzing interaction mechanism studies and nanoencapsulation studies to analyze the progress of using milk proteins as carriers of bioactive compounds. To better understand the subject, a brief review of the characteristics of milk proteins and the techniques used in interaction mechanism studies were also included in this review. We initially discuss interaction mechanism studies involving milk proteins and β-carotene (BC), a bioactive compound chosen to be explored. These studies are essential because they report the different mechanisms of milk proteins in BC complexation. Thus, it made it possible to understand that hydrophobic forces were the main ones involved in the interaction mechanism between milk proteins and BC. Changes in pH and/or temperature can cause changes in the structure of proteins, which influence the complexation process. Finally, we analyzed the studies that formed nanostructures containing BC from milk proteins. Emulsification was the outstanding methodology in nanoencapsulation of BC by milk proteins. The use of polysaccharides and polyphenols improved the milk proteins’ performance in formingation and stabilizing nanostructures containing BC.","['Chemistry', 'Food Science', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general', 'Agriculture', 'Biotechnology']"

As a consequence, there are now more people serving longer sentences or held preventively in indefinite incarceration. Based on ethnographic data generated in two high-security prisons, this book provides insights into the everyday lives of long-term prisoners in Switzerland who are labelled as ‘dangerous’ and preventively held in indefinite incarceration after completing their regular prison sentence. This chapter provides the background for the study on which this book is based. It presents information on the research context and in-depth reflections on how to conduct ethnographic research in a constrained context with heavily stigmatized people.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Human Rights', 'Crime and Society', 'Cultural Geography', 'Social Justice, Equality and Human Rights', 'Forensic Psychology']"

Smallholders could significantly intensify production with the adoption of modern agricultural technologies, but many farmers are unable to find buyers willing to purchase their outputs at profitable prices. Meanwhile, buyers and traders have demand for agricultural goods but face high costs in finding farmers who can consistently supply goods with certified quality. Similarly, there is a lack of investment in food processing infrastructure because processors cannot reliably obtain produce as inputs to operations. These market failures typically manifest in the form of two development challenges: (1) there is a misalignment in the supply of and demand for the agricultural goods produced by smallholder farmers, and (2) smallholder farmers are often at a price disadvantage when it comes to knowledge of prices of their commodities. This case study measures the effect of introducing digital trading and market platforms (including price alerts, mobile phone-based trading platforms, and commodity exchanges) in Ghana, through a series of randomized control trials and quasi-experimental studies. Technologies like mobile price alerts (from Esoko) and a mobile phone-based trading platform (Kudu) are found to increase yam prices by 5%, with benefits for smallholder farmers. This increase declines over time, but there are net benefits for farmers as a result of “bargaining spillover.” The potential impacts of a new commodity exchange in Ghana are also discussed, exploring how this technology can influence the decisions of smallholder farmers, incentivizing them to produce higher-quality products.","['Environment', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Development Economics', 'Development and Sustainability', 'Engineering Design', 'Social/Human Development Studies']"

The concept of usability was first defined by Shackel in 1991 as the extent of successfulness of the user's work, then was gradually formalized by Nielsen and ISO standard Standards . In 1998, Norman coined a new term “UX” (User eXperience) to represent the wider range of quality Quality of human experience that could not be expressed by just the concept of usability. But, the lack of formal definition and methodology Methodologies gave birth to various interpretations. Because of this confusing situation on the concept of UX, “UX White Paper” was published in 2010. But various interpretations still exist in terms of the concept of UX. For the purpose of solving this confusing situation, authors proposed (1) a conceptual model of UX that clarifies the difference between the usability and UX, (2) the process model (DECAGON model) of UX that is related to the lifecycle Lifecycle model of the product or service, and (3) the measurement Measurements method (ERM-AT) of UX that can be used to clarify how the automation and UX are related.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Many definitions of traceability can be found and defined by organizations and individuals with different perspectives based on different products’ supply chain. The global concern for food safety and quality and the need for traceability are being addressed by the development of legislation, new international standards, and industry guidelines. Quality and safety are both linked to traceability, whereas safety is implicated by traceability more often. They are two very important elements of people’s conceptions of food and associated decision-making (i.e., food choice). Traceability is primarily viewed as a tool for the food safety by providing means for recall as well as proof for authenticity of food, but it also related to food quality. Since both quality and safety were shown to be related to confidence, traceability may indeed boost consumer confidence through quality and safety assessments.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Operations Management', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes']"

The Palaeocene Ranikot Formation is untested to date and requires detailed investigation to evaluate its generative potential. The Ranikot section is dominated by clay components (up to 60%), and thus, the unit of interest can be called the Ranikot shale. It was deposited in the shoreface system exhibiting intercalations of sandstones and mudstones formed as thin beds. Lithology and properties of the source section allow considering the formation as a hybrid unconventional petroleum system with organic-rich shales and organic-lean sandstones. The generative potential of the Ranikot shale has been analysed using the wireline logging, X-ray diffraction (XRD), total organic carbon (TOC)/Programmed pyrolysis, kerogen composition and vitrinite reflectance. Average organic richness in individual wells varies from 1.6 to 2.2% TOC. The inferred source intervals reach the thickness between 120 and 200 m. There is a progressive and fairly uniform increasing TOC trend with depth, and it clearly corresponds to mudlogging gas readings, even up to 11–46% of gas. Moreover, there is also overpressure recorded (up to 4500 psi) with pore pressure gradient of 0.59 psi/ft. Pyrolysis S2 and HI yields vary from 0.5 to 3.1 mg HC/g rock and 32 to 143 mg HC/g TOC, respectively. Kerogen composition indicates diverse relation of gas-prone to oil-prone type, which reflects mixed-type organic matter. The northern section of the study area is enriched in type-III kerogen (up to 86%) with very small amount of inertinite (1–6%). The southern section, however, contains much more type-II kerogen (22–74%), but contribution of inertinite reaches even up to 77%. Thermal maturity of the most perspective interval indicates an easterly increasing trend between 0.8 to 1.13% Ro. Therefore, depending on kerogen composition and its thermal maturity, the transformation ratio of organic matter varies between 50 and 90%. The calculated original TOC and hydrocarbon potential is then 1.7–3.2% and 2.8–10 mg HC/g rock, respectively. The gas generation potential is between 5.6 and 7 m 3 /m 3 (243 and 306 Mcf/ac-ft). According to the source section net thickness, the volume of gas generated at the maturity level of around 1.1% Ro was between 0.84 and 1.1 BCM/km 2 (76 and 100 Bcf/mi 2 ).","['Earth Sciences', 'Earth Sciences, general', 'Geochemistry', 'Paleontology']"

Existing approaches to the use of various fundamental solutions for certain space-planning conditions often allow us to provide normalized microclimate parameters, but cannot guarantee them with a certain accuracy. In this regard, numerical modelling of heat and mass transfer processes for non-standard design conditions makes it possible to identify zones whose parameters do not correspond to the normalized ones. Choosing one of the types of heating systems that provide a microclimate of the room, it is impossible to check all areas of the working area for compliance with the requirements of regulatory documents on air temperature. The tasks of checking the thermal regime of the room were considered in many studies and scientific and technical works, however, heat exchange by convection was not taken into account in these works, and the air temperature was assumed constant throughout the working area, which is not a physical solution. In this paper, computational studies were expanded by taking into account the temperature fields of the airspace for three types of heating systems using numerical modelling methods implemented in the ANSYS Fluent software package. The changes in air temperature along the height of the working area were revealed, and the “unfavourable” areas of the working area were checked for compliance with regulatory requirements.

Current research interest in the field of predictive structural modeling has emphasized analytical and sampling approaches to Bayesian inference, which have the respective advantages of either computational speed or inference accuracy. Recent work in optimization-based inference approaches have created new opportunities to balance these advantages and generate flexible, efficient, and scalable filters for joint parameter-state identification of complex nonlinear structural systems. These techniques, commonly referred to as variational inference, infer the hidden states of a system by attempting to match the true posterior and to a parameterized distribution. In this study we build on the theory of automatic differentiation variational inference to introduce a novel approach to variational filtering for the identification of complex structural systems. We evaluate our method using experimental observations from a nonlinear energy sink device subject to base excitation. Comparison between identification performed using our approach and the unscented Kalman filter reveals the utility of the variational filtering technique in terms of both flexibility in the stochastic model and robustness of the method to poor specification of prior uncertainty.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Civil Engineering']"

Various pollutants are released into the environment as industrial wastes from paper and pulp mill, mining, food, electroplating, photographic, textiles, and pharmaceutical industries. In the last decade, there has been an increase in studies to improve the removal of these pollutants from the environment. As a result of multiple studies, bioremediation of these pollutants is getting considerable attention. Bioremediations using microbes have potential for future development because of their cost-effectiveness and eco-friendly nature. A wide variety of microbes are employed in bioremediation including fungi, algae, and bacteria. They work as biologically active methylators. Microorganisms cannot degrade metals, but they can change the chemical properties of metals by their mechanisms. This chapter deals with different groups of microorganisms utilized in bioremediation.","['Life Sciences', 'Microbial Ecology', 'Microbiology', 'Environment, general', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology', 'Sustainable Development']"

The detection of the disease is not perfect as until now, it is having mostly been done manually by the humans. Since human observation is prone to mistakes and can generate inconsistency, there is a need to create a program that is able to improve upon the current diagnosis and detection of the disease with better accuracy. To make such a program, for this paper, a detection model is proposed that utilizes SPECT images of healthy and diseased persons to find the affected region of the brain, this region helps determine the region of interest (ROI) for the study. The model uses artificial neural network and image processing to accomplish its main task of detection. The area values of the ROI are then fed into the model which aims to calculate the pattern of the diseased region to determine the extent of Parkinson’s disease, and whether the brain is healthy or not. This simple but efficient ANN model classifies the subjects with and without PD, with an accuracy of 93%, sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 86%. The ANN model undergoes constant improvement and fed larger datasets over time to improve the accuracy of the model and achieve a better performance than any previously available modes of detection. Hence, the proposed system has the potential to aid the doctors and nurses in the medical field of neurobiology and can be practically implemented to improve the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Sociology, general', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

The term was coined by the President-elect when presenting her would-be College to the European Parliament for its consent vote. The Chapter starts by arguing that such narrative was functional to a “legitimacy by power” approach, linking the Commission’s authority, in the absence of a Spitzenkandidat procedure, to its effective delivery of global leverage. On this basis, we challenge the idea that the Commission has so far failed to deliver on its “geopolitical” ambition. In fact, by assessing it in terms of “open strategic autonomy”, emerged as a cross-cutting strategic response to a set of interlinked megatrends whereby “geopolitics starts at home”, the evidence points to: (i) a positive track record of delivery—starting the Commission’s front-runner role in the global vaccine race and recovery strategy; and (ii) a noticeable inflection point towards increased awareness of the need for more assertiveness and coherence between domestic and external policy agendas. We conclude that the Commission’s geopolitical leadership should increasingly become a strategic foresight leadership, leveraging its unique role as system integrator and coalition builder to collectively reach long-term goals, while challenging the status quo and telling inconvenient truths when needed.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Legislative and Executive Politics']"

Due to the abundance of growth hormone receptors in the body, it is a systemic disease that leads to many complications and concomitant diseases. An obvious medical concern in the context of acromegaly is diabetes. It can be the result of excess growth hormone and its mediators, but it can also result from the treatment of acromegaly. This chapter reveals the pathophysiological role of leptin in glucose and lipid metabolism in diabetic patients, especially those with acromegaly. In addition, there is a section highlighting the effect of acromegaly treatment on glucose metabolism, including approved drugs as well as those currently being explored. It also reviews the observations of the use of antidiabetic drugs in acromegaly patients. Glucose homeostasis is an important feature of the comorbidity of acromegaly and has further care. Although several trials have tested glucose homeostasis in acromegaly, more basic, translational, and clinical investigations are still needed to better consider the underlying mechanisms and how to better report them.","['Biomedicine', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Pharmacology/Toxicology']"

Moreover, epidemiological and clinical research has shown that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is continually associated with IR, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and dyslipidemia. Therefore, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and NAFLD are studied as two conditions that coexist. However, the relationship between these conditions is so solid and convoluted that it is difficult to identify the consequence and the cause. Further, insulin impairment enhances hepatic glucose production and reduces glucose uptake by peripheral tissues. Thus, NAFLD has been identified as a hepatic expression of metabolic syndrome and is strongly associated with visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and IR. Likewise, molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance are influenced by the abnormal secretion of tissue-derived factors such as adipokines, myokines, and hepatokines, which have been recently proposed as praised markers for insulin resistance, NAFLD, and T2DM.","['Biomedicine', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Pharmacology/Toxicology']"

Plants require macro- and micro-nutrients for their growth, development, and reproduction. As a consequence, crop production depends mainly on the availability of mineral nutrients provided as fertilizers. After nitrogen, phosphorous is the second most important growth-limiting macro-nutrient. Therefore, new agricultural practices are needed to improve phosphorus uptake. Here we review the role of biochar, a carbon neutral recycled material, as amendment to soils, in improving phosphorus availability. Biochar is an organic amendment produced by pyrolyzing biomass. Biochar amendments increase soil organic carbon contents and improve soil physical, chemical, and biochemical properties, which in turn leads to better soil fertility and quality. Biochar influences soil phosphorous dynamics by modulating the chemical and biochemical pathways of phosphorous cycling. Biochar addition has increased soil phosphorous content, resulting in higher phosphorous uptake and crop productivity in various cropping systems. Moreover, integrating biochar amendments with organic and mineral phosphorous fertilizers can enhance phosphorous uptake by plants and crop productivity.","['Life Sciences', 'Agriculture', 'Science, multidisciplinary', 'Pollution, general', 'Biotechnology']"

The island was historically far from the mass tourism developments dominant on the other Canary Islands. Tourism accommodations in El Hierro are few compared to more developed coastal areas in the Archipelago, and recreational activities are mainly linked to cultural and natural sites and resources. This chapter focuses on La Restinga fishing village and its coasts, where the ‘Sea of Calms’ and one multiple-use Marine Reserve (MR) are located, both of which became popular over the last decade. The tourist development experience has promoted a new way of looking at the sea and conceptualizing its habitats and populations. In 2014, after the submarine volcano eruption occurred in 2011, we estimated that at least 25,391 dives had been carried out in the diving spots established by the MR and other diving sites close to La Restinga. Despite the difficulties experienced after the volcano eruption, a unique imaginaire has been consolidated, thanks to the image of the island's exclusive nature and iconic elements. In addition, the rapid recovery of the destination is an excellent example of how the tourism system can adapt and incorporate unexpected events such as volcanic eruptions.","['Earth Sciences', 'Geology', 'Geomorphology', 'Archaeology']"

Recently, the XGBoost framework has become very popular among machine learning practitioners and data scientists due to its effectiveness, flexibility, and portability. It exploits the gradient boosting framework and adds several improvements that enhance the performance and accuracy of the model.

It is due to a lack of evidence and consensus on what determines financial performance in the construction context. This paper explores the determinants of Small and Medium Construction Firms’ Financial Performance in Ghana through factor analysis. Study design/methodology/approach The paper employed a factor analytic approach to validate the financial variables of contractors, involving 125 respondents from two areas in Ghana in a cross-sectional survey using a self-administered structured questionnaire for data collection. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) discovered the underlying latent variables that significantly influence the contractor’s financial performance were discovered using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Findings According to the findings, three dimensions relevant to the research setting emerged: funding strategy, management strategy, and prior performance. The developed model’s constructs have a high level of reliability and validity. Originality/value The research adds to the body of knowledge in construction financing models in developing nations. Research limitations The findings of this study should be interpreted in the context of Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly the Ghanaian construction industry. Before making broad generalizations, similar research should be conducted in similar circumstances in multiple nations.

Therefore, accurate and quantitative post-earthquake damage evaluation of real-world structures is crucial for safe operation of buildings. Structural-health monitoring provides sensor-based information regarding the structural state and informs post-earthquake building assessment. With the utilization of monitoring data, which is recorded during earthquake excitation, damage-sensitive features (DSFs) can be extracted in both purely data-driven or hybrid forms; with the latter term referring to damage indicators (DIs) that fuse data with dynamic models. In this paper, data-driven and hybrid damage identification methods are introduced and compared with respect to their performance and robustness in detecting and quantifying structural damage. The damage localization and quantification performance are discussed for varying number of building floors. Moreover, numerical models are used to enable the comparison of DSFs with metrics of nonlinearity, such as maximum drift, and with response metrics that are traditionally used to quantify damage, such as maximum inter-story drifts. Finally, uncertainties in DSFs and their sensitivity to sensor noise, prior knowledge of mass and the spectral content of earthquake excitation are assessed to explore the robustness of the hybrid DI.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

There are victims and profiteers of inflation. Victims include holders of cash assets, savings accounts, fixed incomes, and fixed-income securities, as well as creditors. Profiteers include holders of inflation-resistant assets as well as debtors. A serious shortcoming is the lack of experience with inflation among the current generation of managers. The last inflation scenario similar to the current one occurred in the 1970s. Low-income consumers and those with unavoidable expenses such as commuters are hit hard by inflation. In response, consumers adopt evasive strategies such as not buying, substitution with cheaper products, accepting reductions in utility, or finding additional sources of income. Individual sectors encounter very different consumer reactions to inflation. The scope for price increases varies accordingly. In terms of their price behavior, consumers show an ambivalent reaction. On the one hand, they pay more attention to prices in order to still buy cheaply, so that price elasticity increases. On the other hand, constant and high price changes disrupt the reference price system, so that prices lose relevance. As a large debtor, the State benefits from inflation.

The skulls of early Triassic archosauriforms have been extensively modified in each group, allowing the filling of continental niches available after the Permian-Triassic mass extinction (~252 Ma). The internal anatomy of those skulls reflects the soft tissues that they contained and protected (i.e. central nervous system, vascular tissues, sensorial organs), and the study of these bony correlates, better known as paleoneurology, has been applied to archosauriforms and pseudosuchians since the late 1800’s. Although not enough information is known about the paleoneurology of these groups, it is a flourishing area that has seen remarkable advances in the last decades and still needs to be explored in more detail.

Considering the importance of the water resource and all the problems involving the critical issue of water in Brazil, it is emphasized that sustainability indicators are important for the management of basins and sub-basins, as they serve as a basis for the formulation of action plans to propose improvements and implement solutions. Thus, the results obtained from the information and data collected can be used to understand the indicators related to water resources in the municipalities of the Metropolitan Region of Campinas, in order to alleviate water scarcity and related problems.","['Social Sciences', 'Science and Technology Studies']"

In very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits, the interconnect wires are connected to each other to form thousands of signal nets. It may be challenging to handle large VLSI interconnect structures with the FRW method. In this chapter, we present the basics of FRW method for the capacitance extraction problem, along with two techniques addressing the challenges with large VLSI interconnect nets. One is a virtual Gaussian surface sampling technique. It makes efficient random sampling on the Gaussian surface for complex nets with vias, and optimizes the sampling scheme to reduce the time of random walk. The other is a parallelized, improved construction approach for Octree based space management structure. It can bring more than 5000X speedup and provides same convenience to the FRW procedure. Numerical experiments on large cases with up to about half million conductors validate the presented techniques, and demonstrate a fast FRW based capacitance solver for VLSI interconnect extraction tasks.","['Engineering', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation', 'Engineering Mathematics']"

In recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) promises to automate the development of locomotion controllers and map sensory observations to low-level actions. However, legged locomotion still is a challenging task for DRL algorithms, especially when energy efficiency is taken into consideration. In this paper, we propose a DRL scheme for efficient trotting applied on Laelaps II quadruped in MuJoCo. First, an accurate model of the robot is created by revealing the necessary parameters to be imported in the simulation, while special focus is given to the quadruped’s drivetrain. Concerning, the reward function and the action space, we investigate the best way to integrate in the reward, the terms necessary to minimize the Cost of Transport ( CoT ) while maintaining a trotting locomotion pattern. Last, we present how our solution increased the energy efficiency for a simple task of trotting on level terrain similar to the treadmill-robot environment at the Control Systems Lab [ 1 ] of NTUA.","['Engineering', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Robotics', 'Computational Intelligence']"

In view of this, the purpose of the article is to substantiate the nature, determinants and varieties of moral risks, determine their place in the system of risks of banking activities and develop proposals to improve the effectiveness of moral risks management in the context of economic uncertainty’s. The article determines that among the whole set of banking risks, moral risks are inherent in not only one, but almost all types of banking activity. Therefore, the emphasis is placed on the consideration of moral risks as a component of such systemic risks of banking activities as credit, market, operational and technological, currency risks and risk of change in interest rate. The necessity of considering the moral risks in the two-level plane, at the macro- and micro-levels is argued. It has been determined that one of the ways thus to neutralize moral risks, is to have a system of guaranteeing of banking deposits. It is substantiated that the detection of tendencies unwanted development of events with the purpose of subsequent neutralization of the negative consequences that can lead to one or another risk is carried out through an organized system of management of risk of the functioning of the bank. It is determined that the system of management of risks of the bank should be consistent with the risk classification, which is mandatory to separate into a separate group of moral risks, which will allow banks to have clear and transparent guidelines for building a system of management of risks in banks. Considering the specific nature of moral risks and the considerable level of their unpredictability, are proposed to create in the banks a separate department or position whose functional area of activity will be the identification, assessment and general management of moral risks, as well as to specify the tasks and methodological support of this department (position) in management of the moral risks of bank.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

In this paper, we present the development of a mobile application-based DRS system for SAVs that optimizes profile matchmaking in rides considering users’ preferences. We found rich evidence that comfort (a human experience regarding social aspects and personal safety) impacts the adoption of an environmentally friendly mobility option. Through a design methodology composed by user research, information architecture, and prototyping, we generated knowledge for further development of these systems. Further research is encouraged on the implications of profile matchmaking systems in passengers’ discrimination.

The nanoparticles were synthesized in different proportions of biopolymers and TPP and characterized regarding their size, zeta potential, morphology, chemical interactions, structural characteristics, and antibacterial activity. They were also applied as coatings on strawberries with the aim of increasing fruit shelf-life. Circular dichroism spectra revealed that the addition of TPP altered the secondary structure of lactoferrin. The nanoparticles 3.5L:5.5C:1TPP and 4.5L:4.5C:1TPP showed higher zeta potential values and lower hydrodynamic diameters (+39.30 mV, 81.87 nm and +33.07 mV, 97.67 nm, respectively) and intense bacteriostatic action against S. aureus (0.0370 mg/ml and 0.0463 mg/ml, respectively). The minimum inhibitory concentration of these nanoparticles was three times lower than those of pure biopolymers. When applied to strawberries coating, the nanoparticles delayed the ripening and degradation of the fruit. These results confirm that it is possible to intensify the antimicrobial properties of lactoferrin and chitosan through ionic cross-linking with TPP and, thus, expand their use as natural food preservatives.","['Chemistry', 'Food Science', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general', 'Agriculture', 'Biotechnology']"

In view of the great importance that specialized nutrition represents for epiphytic bromeliads, this chapter gathers the most recent findings regarding the strong influence that ontogenetic stages and some abiotic factors, such as nitrogen nutrition, can exert on the anatomical formation, absorptive capability and distribution of trichomes present on the leaf surface. Studies showing the existence of water inward transport systems involving high- and low-affinity membrane transport proteins and aquaporins are also discussed. Furthermore, we present new discoveries about how the process of water uptake occurs through the entire anatomical structure of the trichome, highlighting the relevance of the wing cells of the shield. Important advances in recent studies regarding the physiological function of the roots of epiphytic bromeliads are also highlighted. Contrary to what was believed in the past regarding the roots of these plants, considering them no more than holdfast structures, the roots of some species of epiphytic tank-forming bromeliads have shown to play an important role in the processes of absorption and metabolization of resources. The new findings related to (1) the influence of developmental stages on the absorptive capability of the roots of epiphytic tank-forming bromeliads, (2) the independence of the absorption mechanisms exerted by the trichomes and roots, and (3) the synergy between the processes of resource uptake carried out by the root system and leaf absorbing trichomes are also presented and discussed in this chapter.","['Life Sciences', 'Plant Sciences', 'Forestry', 'Plant Biochemistry', 'Ecosystems', 'Plant Genetics and Genomics', 'Plant Physiology']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-16262-6_5,en,Failed Negotiations,OriginalPaper,"This chapter constitutes a detailed analysis of why negotiations failed to solve the problem of Nagorno-Karabakh after the First Karabakh War ended in 1994 and eventually led to the Second Karabakh War in 2020. This is largely because both Armenia and Azerbaijan compulsively portrayed themselves as victims of the other’s aggression and their own violence as necessary acts of self-defense. Thus, any just solution to the Nagorny-Karabakh dispute would have entailed painful compromises on both sides, and the necessity to balance radically opposing principles. The main arena for negotiations—the OSCE Minsk Proposals and Madrid Principles—gave first priority to their member states’ own interests and actually helped continue and even facilitate the conflict. The current cease-fire that returns occupied Azerbaijani lands, while allowing the core of Armenian-populated Karabakh to remain, a situation policed by Russian peacekeepers, seems a possible solution. However, although Azerbaijani officials have promised reconciliation and equality to Armenians remaining in Karabakh, given Armenian ambitions few believe this will actually work.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics']"

The periodic structure has a unit cell with three degrees of freedom. We devise an approach that replaces the linear stiffness characteristic of the structure with a nonlinear one in which the nonlinear stiffness coefficients provide the same strain energy. The effect of this approach on the frequency response is analysed using numerical simulation, focusing on band gaps. The approach to determining nonlinear stiffness coefficients is based on the concept of equivalent elastic strain energy. This is different from the common approach found in the literature of adding a cubic term to the linear one, resulting in an increase in the elastic deformation energy of the system. Once the strain energy of the linear system is determined, a family of possible nonlinear stiffness coefficients is found, parameterised by the ratio between the linear and cubic coefficients. This approach can be used with hardening or softening stiffness characteristics. With the nonlinear stiffness coefficients defined, the dynamic response of the metastructure shows the usual shift to high and low frequencies. In addition, some frequency ranges are shown where vibration levels can be greatly reduced when the ratio of nonlinear stiffness coefficients is increased, compared to the case where there are only linear springs. Also, it is shown that the addition of the nonlinear component in the structure can increase or decrease the distance between the resonant frequencies.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis']"

In a critical reading of Hilferding, the author explores the double face of capital defined as social relations and incarnated into capital both in productive capital and in capital-property (property rights). He offers a definition of contemporary finance capital as the intertwining of monopoly industrial, merchant, real estate, land and bank capital under the control of capital-property. He then addresses the relationships between finance capital and militarism. He contrasts Hilferding’s and Luxemburg’s approach to this issue, provides historical evidence of the connections between finance capital and militarism, and concludes on the relevance of Luxemburg’s analysis of militarism with regard to present-day contemporary capitalism.","['Economics', 'Social Choice/Welfare Economics/Public Choice/Political Economy', 'Political Economy/Economic Systems', 'History of Economic Thought/Methodology', 'European Politics']"

Such heat and mass transfer is observed in the seasonal accumulation of natural sources of cold for air-conditioning. Therefore, it is necessary to know heat and mass transfer criteria for the engineering design of cold storages. A theoretical analysis of the observance of the constancy of the heat transfer and mass transfer coefficients for different options of the flow of the cooling process of the air flow in schemes with direct contact of air flow and ice has been carried out. Depending on the option of the process and the method of analysis, possible conditions for observing the similarity of heat exchange and mass exchange processes have been identified, however, in most cases, the processes are not similar. The results of theoretical analysis have been compared with the results of modeling heat exchange and mass exchange processes in the experimental installation. The data obtained during the physical experiment shows that the ratio of heat transfer and moisture transport coefficients is not equal to the theoretical value obtained by Lewis for liquid evaporation. The similarity of heat and moisture transfer processes is not observed over the entire experimental range of changes in the partial pressure of water vapor. This shows the necessarity to improve the theory of heat and mass exchange of air flow with natural sources of cold used for accommodation air conditioning systems.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

A standalone MSE is designated as the most energy-intensive unit, hence, various Energy Reduction Schemes (ERSs) are integrated to enhance the energy efficiency of this unit. Steam Consumption (SC) and Steam Economy (SE) are the two major energy efficiency parameters to judge the energy performance of the MSE. Hence, a single objective optimization problem is developed by considering the interrelation of SE and SC as the objective function for the hybrid MSE. The dependency of the problem variables is stated by the constraint functions developed by employing thermo-dynamical laws that create a couple of nonlinear equations for each stage of MSE. The solution to this optimization problem is obtained using two metaheuristic approaches named Differential Evolution Algorithm and Archimedes Optimization Algorithm. Employment of these algorithms provides excellent performance in searching for optimized unknown process parameters with enhanced energy efficiency for this complex optimization problem.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Sustainable Development', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

Smartphones‚ in particular, stand out as being an ideal self-tracking technology that permits both active logging (via self-reports) and passive tracking of information (via phone logs and mobile sensors). In this chapter, we present the results of a literature review of smartphone-based personal informatics studies across three different disciplinary databases (computer science, psychology, and communication). In doing so, we propose a conceptual framework for organizing the smartphone-based personal informatics literature. Our framework situates self-tracking studies based on their substantive focus across two domains: (1) the measurement domain (whether the study uses subjective or objective data) and (2) the outcome of interest domain (whether the study aims to promote insight or change in physical and/or mental characteristics). We use this framework to identify and discuss research trends and gaps in the literature. For example, most research has been concentrated on tracking of objective measurements to change either physical or mental characteristics, while less research used subjective measures to study a physical outcome of interest. We conclude by pointing to promising future directions for research on self-tracking and personal informatics and emphasize the need for a greater appreciation of individual differences in future self-tracking research.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Health Informatics', 'Health Psychology', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction']"

It is difficult to achieve functional recovery for the damaged central nervous system (CNS) because of its limited ability to regenerate. Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are abundant in the CNS and are known to play essential roles in cell-cell recognition, adhesion, signal transduction, and cellular migration, that are crucial in all phases of neurogenesis. Despite intense investigation of CNS regeneration, the roles of GSLs in neural regeneration remain unclear. Here we focus on the respective potentials of glycolipids to promote regeneration and repair of the CNS. Mice lacking glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide or gangliosides show lethal phenotypes. More importantly, patients with ganglioside deficiencies exhibit severe clinical phenotypes. Further, neurodegenerative diseases and mental health disorders are associated with altered GSL expression. Accumulating studies demonstrate that GSLs not only delimit physical regions but also play central roles in the maintenance of the biological functions of neurons and glia. We anticipate that the ability of GSLs to modulate behavior of a variety of molecules will enable them to ameliorate biochemical and neurobiological defects in patients. The use of GSLs to treat such defects in the human CNS will be a paradigm-shift in approach since GSL-replacement therapy has not yet been achieved in this manner clinically.","['Biomedicine', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurochemistry']"

In this research article, the development of a mist nozzle and its CFD simulation is carried out at different inlet water temperatures and its effect on pressure drop at the outlet end of the nozzle. By measuring the reduction in temperature, cooling capacity, and saturation efficiency, the experimental analysis leads to the discovery of performance characteristics such as cooling effect. These performance parameters were measured in a variety of environments and with variable air mass flow rates. Using the experimental data, a linear regression analysis is used to construct an empirical association to forecast the decline in air temperature.

However, this is a fairly recent development. Through the greater part of mankind’s history, adultery was a crime—one that frequently only women could commit. A man could be punished for being an unfaithful wife’s lover, but not for cheating on his own wife. Even when male adultery was prescribed as an option as well, discrimination was still present: more restrictive conditions were prescribed for a man’s act to be classified as adultery, or punishment was less severe, or seemingly egalitarian rules were interpreted in practice so as to favour men over women. As the fight for women’s rights reached the regulations against adultery, the reforms went not in the direction of equal regulation, but rather of complete decriminalization of adultery. This paper gives a brief overview of the regulations against adultery since Antiquity to the present. Various factors are analyzed, such as the degree of gender (in)equality in regulations against adultery, the prescribed penalties, the influence of religion, the possibility of the justifiable homicide of adulterers.","['Law', 'Theories of Law, Philosophy of Law, Legal History', 'Gender Studies']"

While it is not always evident who should, and should not, be included under the umbrella of “Big Tech,” some candidates are fairly apparent, including Apple, Meta, and Alphabet. These companies and their products have had an outsize impact on smartphones (and other similar devices, as well as enabling services such as digital payment systems and media), social media, and Web search. At the same time, it has become evident over the last several years that companies not traditionally or currently classed as Big Tech companies, such as Tesla, but also large defense companies, such as Lockheed Martin, have also made important innovations in various subfields of AI. We briefly comment on these, before switching our discussion to the Chinese “Big Tech.” Finally, we comment on the important and disruptive role that small- and medium-sized enterprises, including startups, play in fostering and commercializing innovation in emerging technologies such as AI. We close the chapter with a case study on neural language models that have revolutionized applications in natural language processing and potential ethical concerns.","['Business and Management', 'IT in Business', 'Industries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Business Strategy/Leadership']"

Enzyme testing can be performed to validate an experimental system prior to a difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) proteomic experiment and can also be utilized as an integral part of multifaceted experiment in conjunction with DIGE. Data from enzyme tests can be used to corroborate results of DIGE proteomic experiments where an enzyme or enzymes are demonstrated by DIGE to be differentially expressed. Enzyme testing can also be utilized to support data from DIGE experiments that demonstrate metabolic changes in a biological system. The different types of enzyme assays that can be performed in conjunction with DIGE experiments are reviewed alongside a discussion of experimental approaches for designing enzyme assays.,"['Chemistry', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general']"

The majority of MSW is discarded in open dumping which contains all sorts of complex organic and inorganic fractions in higher concentrations, and this creates all types of nuisances like leachate and bad odor in the surrounding area. The produced leachate percolates through surrounding soil altering its characteristics. In this particular paper, we review the effects of open dumping of MSW on surrounding soil characteristics. By geochemical analysis, it has been observed that the soil sample obtained contains enough higher concentrations of the organic fraction to influence the properties of soil. The soil samples were obtained at various depths at locations surrounding the dumpsite. The soil samples were also subjected to other tests for further analysis of mechanical properties, namely specific gravity test, grain size analysis, California bearing ratio test (CBR), Atterberg’s limit test, direct shear test, compaction test, and permeability analysis. It has been observed that there was a decrease in the trend of specific gravity, CBR, and Cohesion values and an increase in trends of permeability of soil compared to unaffected soil in the same region. The study done on biological activity in soil showed increased microbial activity. It has been reported that open dumping has altered the mechanical properties of soil and altered its ecology.","['Engineering', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Environment, general']"

In this chapter, we argue that blockchains are not about trust per se and that supply chains can and do function effectively – with the mediation of blockchain technologies – without the presupposition of trust. Through the phenomenological lens of Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty and Todes, we posit how blockchains redefine trust in the supply chain context with an exploratory field study. Our analysis suggests that blockchains are better understood as sources of information reliability and accountability that make supply chain transactions possible in a zero-trust environment. Overcoming information asymmetry as a basis for enhanced supply chain functionality through undisrupted parallel flows of products, money and information is what blockchain can significantly contribute towards. If blockchains are – despite commonly held beliefs – not in-and-of-itself about trust, their technology-mediated features can redefine trust in supply chains. The chapter exemplifies the argument by looking at the rise of social commerce in China, which is a good example to illustrate such possibilities.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Supply Chain Management', 'Professional Computing', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Logistics']"

The current earthen defence systems are crucial assets for the safety of the built environment but require a reliability assessment and possible renovation to keep up with new safety standards. To this purpose, the numerical methods represent an effective tool, when the soil-atmosphere interaction is accurately modelled and the relevant constitutive parameters are identified. Their effectiveness hinges also on the possibility to use environmental data from site monitoring as input loads. Within this framework, the paper presents thermo-hydraulic finite element analyses of a floodplain and river levee, aimed to assess the system response to a flood event. The role of two aspects is discussed: (i) the unsaturated soil properties, namely the soil water retention curve and the permeability function, and (ii) the soil initial saturation condition that depends on the environmental load history preceding the flood event. The results confirm that the soil’s natural capability to mitigate the flood event is driven by its saturation condition.","['Engineering', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Offshore Engineering']"

However, support for the act was elicited through the depiction of Fascism as foreign and un-British. The government therefore leveraged the very same xenophobic sentiments and fears—the same fetishes of difference—that characterise Fascist ideology. Moreover, by rejecting the inclusion of specific reference to racial and religious prejudice in s 5 of the Act, the POA36 created an offence that could be used just as easily against those resisting racism as against those promoting it. Thus, the ability of the state to pacify outbreaks of disorder was a stronger motivation for the POA36 than the protection of Jews.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Critical Criminology', 'Human Rights', 'Political Sociology', 'Socio-legal Studies', 'Public Law', 'Political Science']"

To survive, endophytes have adapted to produce secondary metabolites mimicking their host plant and synthesize the required enzymes which are used for cell wall penetration and colonization of the host plant. Therefore, endophytic microorganisms could be a source of novel enzymes able to catalyze the organic transformation of a wide range of valuable fine chemicals derived from natural products. This chapter presents various strategies to discover new biocatalyst within the endophytic community. The chemical entities naturally present in the plant suggest that the associated endophytes could be able to synthesize, metabolize, or modify a portion of the chemical structure. Enrichment and isolation in the presence of the metabolite of interest is a useful strategy to selectively isolate endophytes with the metabolic capacity to modify or degrade the compound. In addition, the use of different growing media, including one that mimics the internal environment of the plant, has also proven advantageous.","['Life Sciences', 'Microbiology']"

The recent COVID-19 pandemic is an all too real example of how disruptive this variation can be to the unprepared. Clearly, structurally flexible and short lead time supply chains can help. Beyond this flexibility, we introduce the concept of agile supply chain planning, which deals with early detection and quick and effective decision-making. This chapter describes how agile supply chain planning systems can complement the advances made in dealing with normal variation by successfully dealing with “special” events and lead to significant impact both for drastic, generalized crises or less dramatic occasions. Keywords: agile; decision making; planning; execution; uncertainty, special causes of variation; digital fact based","['Business and Management', 'Operations Management', 'Operations Research, Management Science', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

First, it explores the historical background to the migrations. Second, it moves nearer to the present and looks at the context of Cold War labor migration programs. Lastly, it examines the economic and geopolitical context. In the second part of the chapter, the lens shifts from the policies to those affected by those policies. Based on oral history interviews with migrants, I examine their complex reasoning for signing up for the labor migration programs. Angolan and Mozambican migrants to East Germany were as much educational migrants, war migrants, and aspirational migrants as they were labor migrants. Demonstrating the complexity of the bottom-up perspective of this migration, I argue that exploring migrants’ multiple, overlapping, and fluid motives challenges prevailing concepts of socialist migrants as passive participants, as well as stagnant definitions of labor migration.","['History', 'World History, Global and Transnational History', 'African History', 'European History', 'Labor History', 'Migration']"

Natural rewards and drugs of abuse can trigger similar changes in the neurobiological substrates that drive food- and drug-seeking behaviors. This review examines the impact natural rewards and drugs of abuse have on perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs are specialized extracellular matrix structures that ensheathe certain neurons during development over the critical period to provide synaptic stabilization and a protective microenvironment for the cells they surround. This review also analyzes how natural rewards and drugs of abuse impact the density and maturation of PNNs within reward-associated circuitry of the brain, which may contribute to maladaptive food- and drug-seeking behaviors. Finally, we evaluate the relatively few studies that have degraded PNNs to perturb reward-seeking behaviors. Taken together, this review sheds light on the complex way PNNs are regulated by natural rewards and drugs and highlights a need for future studies to delineate the molecular mechanisms that underlie the modification and maintenance of PNNs following exposure to rewarding stimuli.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Psychiatry', 'Neurosciences', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Biological Psychology']"

Although the behavior of Lamb waves has been dealt with in depth, there are still topics where research is needed, for example, the influence of prestress on Lamb wave propagation. In order to gain profound insight into this area, experimental methods and results on wave propagation under the influence of prestress have been presented in previous work by the authors. These results are characterized by the use of a 2d Fourier transform to evaluate the observation of this behavior over large frequency ranges. Based on these results, the work presented here deals with a 2d numerical modeling approach of the wave propagation in a prestressed structure. The focus is on analyzing the suitability of linear and non-linear material models for reproducing the wave velocity changes. For this purpose, the numerically obtained results for different material models are compared with experimental data. The numerical data is generated using a FE model which combines a nonlinear static computation for the prestress and a linear eigenfrequency computation for the dispersion behaviour of Lamb waves. Finally, the comparison of simulated and experimental data will provide a well-founded basis for further numerical analysis on this topic.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

doi:10.1007/124_2022_59,en,Experimental Evidence for Fruit Memory and Its Applications to Post-harvest Physiology and Technology: An Overview,OriginalPaper,"Memory is a phenomenon that allows organisms, including plants, to store and recall information from previous events and then change their responses to future stressful conditions. The mechanisms of memory in plants seem to have (epi)genetic, metabolic, and also electrical bases. Fruits, like other plant modules, are subject to different stimuli from the environment and the plant that bears them. They are expected to have the ability to retain and use information and to be able to send signals to the rest of the plant. In the post-harvest, priming and acclimation behind several storage techniques are closely related to memory. Here, we revisited the literature addressing memory-related traits in fruits and we propose it as experimental evidence for fruit memory. Additionally, we offer an experimental design to test memory in fruits. Several studies related to fruit acclimation and resistance have demonstrated memory effects. Pre- and post-harvest treatments and stresses, of biotic and abiotic origin, can induce long- and short-term memory in fruits. An example is the use of pre-treatments with low temperatures to acclimate fruits to freezing temperatures and reduce cold injuries. A new perspective in this study, such as attributing memory to fruit, may help to find new solutions to improve post-harvest shelf life and quality, as well as a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the observed responses. Still, one of the major problems is the lack of experiments designed specifically to test the hypothesis of fruit memory. To complete our contribution in this work, we propose an experimental model to test fruit memory involving pre- and post-harvest stimuli.","['Life Sciences', 'Plant Sciences', 'Forestry', 'Plant Biochemistry', 'Ecosystems', 'Plant Genetics and Genomics', 'Plant Physiology']"

Also, the strength calculation shall be preceded by a kinematic analysis to determine the kinematic parameters and links of the mechanism which is required to finding the inertial forces and moments of the links. One must know in advance or obtain the weights and inertial moments of the links, the external loads impacting the mechanisms, the useful resistance force to be overcome by the mechanism, and all geometrical dimensions. Strength calculation of a mechanism is aimed at finding reactions in the kinematic pairs, as well as counterbalance forces or counterbalance moments. The data on forces in the kinematic pairs is required to calculate strength, rigidity, vibration resistance, and wear resistance the mechanism links, to calculate bearing durability and to perform other similar calculations during the mechanism design. The dynamic force analysis method (d’Alembert’s principle) is applied in strength calculations allowing to solve the complex dynamic problem of the mechanism using rather simple static equations. This paper professionally describes a method of strength analysis on a bulldozer ripper mechanism used in open-cast mining and construction. This model of the ripper mechanism strength calculation is expected to be subsequently used for computer-aided calculation of the strength parameters of such mechanism.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Mechatronics']"

But when the final aim is to perform live on stage, the employment of these technologies is anything but straightforward, for sharing the virtual musical experience with the audience gets quite arduous. In this chapter, we assess in detail the several technical and conceptual challenges linked to the composition of IVMI performances on stage, i.e., their scenography , providing a new critical perspective on IVMI performance and design. We first propose a set of dimensions meant to analyse IVMI scenographies, as well as to evaluate their compatibility with different instrument metaphors and performance rationales. Such dimensions are built from the specifics and constraints of DMIs and VEs; they include the level of immersion of musicians and spectators and provide an insight into the interaction techniques afforded by 3D user interfaces in the context of musical expression. We then analyse a number of existing IVMIs and stage setups, and finally suggest new ones, with the aim to facilitate the design of future immersive performances.","['Computer Science', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Computer Appl. in Arts and Humanities', 'Music', 'Media Design', 'Multimedia Information Systems']"

This history will show how the economy has played a decisive role in some turning points characterised by innovation not only on a strictly commercial or productive level, but also on that of spirituality and culture. Damanhurian economy, based on the ethical values of reciprocity and trust—represented by the credito , the complementary currency system—appears as a field for the development of best practices to be exported outside the Community. By bringing values and practices across the spatial and symbolic boundaries of the Community, the economy acquires a performative character: “performative economy” is a means for citizens to learn collectively and reflect on their own norms and identity.","['Religious Studies', 'Spirituality', 'History of World War II and the Holocaust']"

Lessons from a Multi-sectoral Perspective,OriginalPaper,"Vision Zero is a term mainly connected with road traffic safety and has its roots in the Swedish road safety strategy. It was formally adopted by the Swedish parliament in 1997, and due to the initial success of lowering the number of deaths in traffic crashes significantly, it has become a role model for road safety strategies in countries and cities all over the world. In Sweden, Vision Zero for road safety has also inspired the introduction of Vision Zero policies in other sectors, and this chapter focuses on Vision Zero from a multi-sectoral perspective. The purpose of this chapter is twofold: to present five different cases of Vision Zero policies and to discuss what constitutes a Vision Zero policy based on these five cases. The five cases are found in road traffic safety, fire safety, patient safety, suicide, and workplace safety. Every case has its unique preconditions in terms of laws, actors, scope, etc., but they are also similar in relation to injury prevention and the ambition to decrease the number of deaths and serious injuries. The five Vision Zero policies are summarized by presenting the problem and problem framing, the goal, measures, and solutions as well as leading actors and governing structures. We find that the problem itself is quite self-explanatory in each case but that the problem framing and attribution of responsibility differ. All cases have on paper been inspired by the road safety strategies, but the systems approach, so intimately connected with Vision Zero, is more or less absent in the cases of fire safety and suicide. Furthermore, in the field of fire safety, responsibility is placed on the individual and on the business sector rather than based on a shared responsibility and ultimately on the system designers. In all five cases, there are a set of measures in place, but there are differences in implementation due to temporal factors and also what kind of governing and steering structures are in place. There is also a difference in internal support where the Vision Zero for suicide stands out as having less support among agencies working with the issue. Finally, the monitoring systems differ from case to case. The Vision Zero for road traffic safety stands out as having a monitoring and evaluating system based on specific safety targets ultimately aiming toward zero (management by objectives). Based on the empirical findings, we argue that besides having a clear problem and problem framing, a toolbox of measures, a monitoring system, and a governing structure, a policy based on a visionary approach with an ambition to reach zero needs additional perspectives or criteria in order to be successful: (1) a scientific approach to problem framing and solutions, (2) a comprehensive approach, (3) a long-term commitment, and (4) a system and structure based on governance . These criteria do not necessarily have to be in place in order to adopt Vision Zero, but they are a prerequisite for building a system based on Vision Zero.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

Multiple sensors or sensor-networks are deployed to create Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), which comes with advanced technologies to assist the driver’s decision making. These systems aid by providing cognitive information collected by the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) from the sensor-network to the drivers by means of alerting, beeping, and warning or by taking control of the system itself, with very minimal warning time (generally in msec or µsec). ITS help in maintaining the minimum safe distance & speed, assists the driver to change lanes with necessary information on the traffic scenario in adjacent lanes. In coming days/times ahead, the automotive industry is focused towards achieving fully autonomous vehicles (Level-5). For autonomous vehicles to become a reality, the ITS will play a key role, as the major milestones would be to reach high-speed connectivity between the interconnected systems and data processing/transfer between them also becoming more stimulating. With systems becoming complicated in design and implementation, Systems engineering (SE) today can manage and help industries to deploy their ideations, due to the consistent evolution of its methodologies and engineering modelling techniques. This paper focuses on the need of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) standard practices, integration of modelling and simulations along with other digital enterprise functions to manage the ever growing and evolving systems, and how alignment with it would help automotive Tier-1 Component Suppliers and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to manage the mobility needs for the future. The content highlights the essence of utilizing MBSE along with SE practices to minimize project lead time overruns. It outlines the generic information of ITS and a note on ever growing complexity of systems. Additionally, this paper will also touch upon the SE Vision 2025 and key take-aways for the automotive industry.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In addition, we assessed sex-specific associations between the validated proteins and pathophysiological pathways of type 2 diabetes. Methods This cross-sectional study included Black South African men ( n =380) and women ( n =375) who were part of the Middle-Aged Soweto Cohort (MASC). Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to determine fat mass and visceral adipose tissue, and fasting venous blood samples were collected for analysis of glucose, insulin and C-peptide and for targeted proteomics, measuring a total of 184 pre-selected protein biomarkers. An OGTT was performed on participants without diabetes, and peripheral insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index), HOMA-IR, basal insulin clearance, insulin secretion (C-peptide index) and beta cell function (disposition index) were estimated. Participants were classified as having normal glucose tolerance (NGT; n =546), IGM ( n =116) or type 2 diabetes ( n =93). Proteins associated with dysglycaemia (IGM or type 2 diabetes) in the MASC were validated in the Swedish EpiHealth cohort (NGT, n =1706; impaired fasting glucose, n =550; type 2 diabetes, n =210). Results We identified 73 proteins associated with dysglycaemia in the MASC, of which 34 were validated in the EpiHealth cohort. Among these validated proteins, 11 were associated with various measures of insulin dynamics, with the largest number of proteins being associated with HOMA-IR. In sex-specific analyses, IGF-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) was associated with lower HOMA-IR in women (coefficient –0.35; 95% CI –0.44, –0.25) and men (coefficient –0.09; 95% CI –0.15, –0.03). Metalloproteinase inhibitor 4 (TIMP4) was associated with higher insulin secretion (coefficient 0.05; 95% CI 0.001, 0.11; p for interaction=0.025) and beta cell function (coefficient 0.06; 95% CI 0.02, 0.09; p for interaction=0.013) in women only. In contrast, a stronger positive association between IGFBP2 and insulin sensitivity determined using an OGTT (coefficient 0.38; 95% CI 0.27, 0.49) was observed in men ( p for interaction=0.004). A posteriori analysis showed that the associations between TIMP4 and insulin dynamics were not mediated by adiposity. In contrast, most of the associations between IGFBP2 and insulin dynamics, except for insulin secretion, were mediated by either fat mass index or visceral adipose tissue in men and women. Fat mass index was the strongest mediator between IGFBP2 and insulin sensitivity (total effect mediated 40.7%; 95% CI 37.0, 43.6) and IGFBP2 and HOMA-IR (total effect mediated 39.1%; 95% CI 31.1, 43.5) in men. Conclusions/interpretation We validated 34 proteins that were associated with type 2 diabetes, of which 11 were associated with measures of type 2 diabetes pathophysiology such as peripheral insulin sensitivity and beta cell function. This study highlights biomarkers that are similar between cohorts of different ancestry, with different lifestyles and sociodemographic profiles. The African-specific biomarkers identified require validation in African cohorts to identify risk markers and increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes in African populations.

It has been praised by philosophers and cognitive scientists alike for its unificatory power as a theory of cognition in general, and recently some researchers have also claimed that it can provide a unifying view of social understanding.

doi:10.1007/978-1-0716-2748-8_6,en,How the Sucrose Preference Succeeds or Fails as a Measurement of Anhedonia,OriginalPaper,"The sucrose preference test is used in laboratory rodents as a reward-based test to indicate a decrease in the sensitivity to a reward (anhedonia), which is a key symptom of major depression. It is based on the animal’s natural preference for sweets, with the assumption that this preference is in proportion to the pleasure that the animal experiences when it consumes sweetened solutions. As such, a reduction in the intake and preference of a sucrose-sweetened solution in rodents, typically compared to plain water over a fixed time frame, is considered as a manifestation of anhedonia. Despite the seemingly technical simplicity of the test, many laboratories experience serious difficulties in establishing this method in a sufficiently reproducible manner, especially in mice. Moreover, while a manifestation of anhedonia in the sucrose test parallels other depressive-like changes in rodents, the stratification of animals upon their hedonic responses as anhedonic and non-anhedonic is often problematic. Here, we address the most common technical, physical, and physiological phenomena that typically confound the evaluation of hedonic sensitivity with the sucrose test in laboratory mice and rats. The impact of these factors is often underestimated or neglected in routine laboratory work. When taken under control, however, the accuracy and sensitivity of the test is substantially increased and the abovementioned limitations with this method are resolved.","['Biomedicine', 'Neurosciences']"

To prove this, I shall divide the dissertation in three sections: in the first one, I meditate on the phenomenological framework of feeling, music and history that leads to a tragic experience of time; in the second section, I set out in broad outline how tragedy opposes metaphysics, Christianity and romanticism so as to make comprehensible why man is essentially a weak or rather an insubstantial being that gets his identity beyond the would-be natural or egotistic identity of his; in the third section, I dwell upon some events of the last century that are supposed to symbolise a radical change in the perception of humanity and I choose one of them for the reasons that I give there so as to confirm the precedent approach. This way, the phenomenological exposition provides the indispensable thread to weave the cultural interpretation and vice versa. In a brief colophon, I epitomise the whole conceptual development to emphasise that this is not an exegesis of Nietzsche’s thought (which is moreover obvious in view of the freedom wherewith I move through the initial and the last phases of its development) but an application thereof to the understanding of the present sense of man through the notions of feeling and weakness that I use both in an ontological and a critical sense.","['Philosophy', 'Phenomenology']"

The modalities used and the types of procedures for which IONM is utilized have expanded greatly since 1979. Today, the most common pediatric procedures for which IONM is used are those that may place the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts, brainstem auditory pathways, dorsal columns, cranial nerves, and/or somatic nerve roots at risk.

Design/methodology/approach We conducted a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications indexed in one of the largest international citation databases of peer-reviewed literature (Scopus) for the past 5 years. The following terms were selected: Blue Economy, Ocean Economy, Blue Growth, Ecosystem-Based Management and Marine Spatial Planning. For the detailed search query, we adopted the classification of the traditional and emerging sectors of the Ocean Economy, developed by the OECD, and integrated relevant keywords (equivalents) from the marine economy framework classification of the EU, US and China Blue Economy sectors. Findings The results show that non-regional actors (like the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada) have been actively involved in the research agenda in the field of the Blue Economy, inter alia in the Black Sea Region, while the representation of the regional stakeholders (in particular, the BSEC Member States) is relatively low.

The basic concepts of project planning are introduced, describing the statement of work, statement of compliance, work breakdown structure, and organisational breakdown structure. These are highly relevant tools for the proper definition of the contractual framework of a project that clearly defines the expectations and obligations. The initial project schedule is introduced as an important means to estimate the overall project duration prior to its start. It is then replaced by the working schedule which monitors the actual state and reflects potential delays accrued during the project execution. The early detection of delays and the understanding of the underlying reasons allow the project responsible to take early corrective actions. This helps to recover or at least minimise potential negative implications on the project (e.g., a budget overrun). The precedence diagramming is presented as a method to put the various activities into the required sequence of execution. The identification of the critical path is needed to identify all those work packages that could potentially delay the overall project duration which is demonstrated using the example of a TT&C antenna deployment. The need to identify potential risk factors for a project and to describe and track them in a risk register, is emphasised. The definition of system hierachies allows to decompose a system into subsystems and trace specific functions and requirements to them which simplifies the development, verification, and integration activities. The definition of life cycle stages decomposes a project into different phases that are characterised by a set of mile stones and gates, at which it must be decided whether to proceed from one stage to the next one. The Vee model being one of the most prominent life cycle models in SE is explained in more detail. Whereas plan-driven or waterfall models adhere to a strict sequence of how the life-cycle stages and processes are executed, incremental and iterative development methods are described as an alternative approach that allow to adjust the system design based on intermediate user inputs, before delivering the final product. Furthermore, the main concepts of model based systems engineering (MBSE) and other agile SE methods are outlined. Finally, the need for quality assurance is explained which defines the set of standards used for the specification, development, reviews, and testing in a project.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Astronomy, Astrophysics and Cosmology', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Management of Computing and Information Systems', 'Operations Management', 'Security Science and Technology']"

In order to promote the economic development, the grid interconnection and the market construction are the main objectives of the power industry. As a part of ancillary service, frequency regulation plays an important role in the electricity market and has an important impact on the stability of smart grid. With the concept of demand-side management put forward, controlling the working state of load has become an effective method to regulate the power grid frequency. With the continuous improvement of people’s living standard, TCL accounts for a large porportion of industrial, commercial and residential electricity. The proportion of power consumption is rising, and the impact on the smart grid is gradually increasing, especially in the peak period of power consumption. If the TCL is not controlled, it is easy to cause serious problems such as power failure, power grid fluctuation and line burning, which will have an adverse impact on the power generation side, transmission network and users. In addition, with the introduction of renewable energy generation, demand side energy management is particularly important. TCL has high flexibility, which can be used as an energy storage system to control it properly and provide a variety of auxiliary services for smart grid. Based on the stochastic battery dissipation theory, the convergent TCL is equivalent to a generalized energy storage battery, and the adjustable energy threshold of frequency regulation service provided by large-scale TCLs is analyzed. The results show that the aggregated TCLs have the characteristics similar to energy storage device, and its adjustable energy storage capacity is limited, especially when the set value is unchanged. However, when the set value is dynamically adjusted, its energy storage capacity can be increased accordingly, so as to provide more services. However, under the control of existing controllers such as linear quadratic controller and internal model controller, the accurate control of convergent air conditioning load cannot be realized. Therefore, in the process of providing frequency regulation services for smart grid, the research focus is to ensure the energy storage capacity and control accuracy of aggregated TCLs.","['Engineering', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks', 'Control and Systems Theory']"

The wide ratification of the ICC Statute together with the domestic implementation of international criminal law and international humanitarian law, as well as the establishment of war crimes units pursuant to legislation at times allowing for universal jurisdiction can attest to the success of the complementarity system. In fact, the atrocities committed in the last decade during armed conflicts in Syria, Iraq, and Ukraine are at the centre of domestic accountability efforts that can meaningfully contribute towards the dynamic development of international criminal law, or—in the words of the Presiding Judge in a Syrian case before the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart, Germany—‘help the law, including international criminal law, achieve a breakthrough’ (OLG Stuttgart, 5—2 StE 5/17-4). This chapter will attempt an interpretation of the counter-hegemonic turn in international criminal law through the lens of the hegemony of the United Nations Security Council members, particularly Russia. Although Russia’s involvement in both Syrian and Ukrainian conflicts is significant, there has been little scholarly attention to date focusing on the Russian approaches towards the evolution of international criminal law in these contexts. The cognizance by the local populations that the UN-affiliated institutions cannot intervene in conflicts such as Syria or Eastern Ukraine, had an impact on the proliferation of grassroots documentation initiatives. These initiatives, broadly described as ‘Entrepreneurial Justice’ coordinated by civil society actors, continue to provide professional assistance to prosecution authorities which has paradoxically led to ‘justice ownership’ by the communities in Syria, Ukraine and beyond, thus pointing towards a breakthrough in the development of international criminal law.","['Law', 'International Criminal Law', 'Public International Law', 'Human Rights', 'Sources and Subjects of International Law, International Organizations']"

The new UN system allowed for a more intense scrutiny of colonial realities and provided new opportunities to anti-colonial actors. In the International Labour Organization, new standards emerged regulating labour and social policies in “non-metropolitan territories”. This chapter focuses on the ways Portuguese imperial and colonial officials interacted with, and reacted to, these political, legal, and institutional transformations in the immediate post-war years. Overall, they regarded international efforts to expand social rights or to outright eliminate forced labour in colonial settings with suspicion. Officials and experts shared the belief that “native” workers were essentially different from their European counterparts. As such, “special” juridical regimes were still needed in the colonies. In the meantime, local reports and news continued to arrive in imperial and colonial offices pointing to the persistence of forced labour in Portuguese African colonies. These dynamics fed imperial anxieties about the possibility of international normative integration. But international labour standards, associated mechanisms, languages and norms gradually became incorporated into the daily routine of administrative officials.","['History', 'Imperialism and Colonialism', 'Labor History', 'African History', 'History of Modern Europe', 'World History, Global and Transnational History']"

Results showed that the area fraction of the β-Li phase remained unchanged, and the grain size of the β-Li phase decreased after forging. The as-rolled forged alloy (FR-LZ91) exhibited the highest area fraction of the β-Li phase and the longest grains. The corrosion resistance of the forged LZ91 alloy increased due to grain refinement that prevented further corrosion during the immersion test. Among the experimental alloys, FR-LZ91 showed the highest resistance of corrosion film and charge transfer resistance values due to its protective film caused by the high area fraction of the β-Li phase.","['Materials Science', 'Materials Science, general', 'Metallic Materials', 'Characterization and Evaluation of Materials', 'Ceramics, Glass, Composites, Natural Materials', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings']"

Despite the importance of education to gain required expertise, there is dearth of in-depth understanding of the effectiveness of current pedagogies. Engagement is an essential aspect of any pedagogical experience, directly affecting knowledge retention. However, the traditional evaluation methods are unsuitable for objectively understanding engagement. Interpretation of physiological response can provide insight into the emotional state of learners. Recent advancements in wearable technologies and physiology offer objective approach to measure the engagement level. In this regard, this study aims to assess the feasibility of wearable physiological sensing technologies for understanding the engagement level of students learning emerging technologies in construction. The potential of electrodermal activity (EDA), photoplethysmography (PPG), and skin temperature (ST) was investigated in detecting the engagement level of students. Ten minutes of biosignals were acquired from 5 students in two different learning experiences (i.e., passive learning through slides and active learning through didactic videos). Different metrics (electrodermal level, the mean value of PPG, mean skin temperature, etc.) were calculated from the time domain and frequency domain to investigate the potential of the suggested biosignals. Results indicated a statistically significant difference in the physiological metrics extracted from biosignals of the student in different learning setups with varying levels of engagement. Findings demonstrated the feasibility of wearable sensors to evaluate the students’ engagement level in their learning of emerging technologies of construction.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

To research bearing health state and remaining useful lifetime, several datasets have been developed. Among these datasets, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset is the most commonly used for bearing diagnosis. A large variety of approaches are applied on CWRU dataset and generating good even the tendency of perfect results. However, most of these approaches are based on supervised learning approaches and focus on classification of bearing faults. In this contribution, in difference to well-known existing approaches, an unsupervised approach combining autoencoder with k-mean is applied on the CWRU dataset. Firstly, the original data are segmented into proper parts. Segments in time domain are transformed to time-frequency domain by adjusting the window length and window function using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), and an associated spectrogram is generated. Spectrogram features are extracted using autoencoder and clustered using K-mean. Various metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. All metrics values demonstrate that this approach could distinguish CWRU bearing from fault-free state to faulty state. As a new result, the requirement of related training datasets of the other approach is – for fault detection – no longer necessary in the future.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

However, it is not used by typical model-based RL (MBRL) agents. We propose a data-centric approach to this problem. We build a controllable optimization process for MBRL agents that selectively prioritizes the data used by the model-based agent to improve its performance. We show how this can favor implicit task generalization in a custom environment based on MetaWorld with a parametric task variability. Furthermore, by bootstrapping the agent’s data, our method can boost the performance on unstable environments from DeepMind Control Suite. This is done without any additional data and architectural changes outperforming state-of-the-art visual model-based RL algorithms. Additionally, we frame the approach within the scope of methods that have unintentionally followed the controllable optimization process paradigm, filling the gap of the data-centric task-bootstrapping methods.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Neurosciences']"

Their primary usage is to perform image classifying tasks. All neural networks, including convolutional neural networks, are susceptible to the overfitting issue, which can occur when the network exhibits good performance on the train data while failing to accurately predict the new data when it is fed to the inputs. Few regularization approaches exist that may help in avoiding the overfit. This paper proposes a novel swarm intelligence optimization method to address the overfitting problem by choosing the adequate dropout parameter value. Swarm algorithms have previously been used to optimize the structure of neural networks; however, the full potential of these algorithms has yet not been thoroughly investigated. Scientists must invest a lot of time to choose the appropriate dropout value if they execute this task manually. In this research, an automated framework, that uses improved sine cosine metaheuristics to perform this task, is proposed. The proposed framework was tested on four standard benchmark datasets, namely MNIST, CIFAR10, Semeion, and UPS. The simulation results have been validated against the results generated by several other state-of-the-art swarm intelligence algorithms. The comparison shows that the proposed method outperforms other cutting-edge algorithms in terms of classification error, therefore achieving higher accuracy percentage.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Cognitive Psychology', 'Personality and Social Psychology', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

Here we provide an overview of these findings, focusing on measures that have traditionally been thought to reflect synaptic spine density or synaptic activity and that are relevant for understanding if there is lower synaptic density in the disorder. We conducted literature searches to identify meta-analyses or other relevant studies in patients with chronic or first-episode schizophrenia, or in people at high genetic or clinical risk for psychosis. We identified 18 meta-analyses including over 50,000 subjects in total, covering: structural MRI measures of gyrification index, grey matter volume, grey matter density and cortical thickness, neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging, PET imaging of regional glucose metabolism and magnetic resonance spectroscopy measures of N-acetylaspartate. We also review preclinical evidence on the relationship between ex vivo synaptic measures and structural MRI imaging, and PET imaging of synaptic protein 2A (SV2A). These studies show that schizophrenia is associated with lower grey matter volumes and cortical thickness, accelerated grey matter loss over time, abnormal gyrification patterns, and lower regional SV2A levels and metabolic markers in comparison to controls (effect sizes from ~ −0.11 to −1.0). Key regions affected include frontal, anterior cingulate and temporal cortices and the hippocampi. We identify several limitations for the interpretation of these findings in terms of understanding synaptic alterations. Nevertheless, taken with post-mortem findings, they suggest that schizophrenia is associated with lower synaptic density in some brain regions. However, there are several gaps in evidence, in particular whether SV2A findings generalise to other cohorts.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Psychiatry', 'Neurosciences', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Biological Psychology']"

Plant-based pesticides can therefore be an ecological alternative to synthetic pesticides to improve the efficiency of agricultural production and sustainably reduce the food crisis, while protecting the health of consumers. They are cheap, biodegradable, environmentally friendly and act more specifically through multiple mechanisms of action, suggesting that they are less dangerous to humans and the environment.

The use of plum fruit ( Spondias mombin ) as a substrate in a biowaste energy conversion system is a solution to the problem of fossil fuel through gasification. The aim of this research is to design and fabricate a gasifier for liquid fuel production from S. mombin (plum seed). This work was achieved by harvesting, drying, and pulverizing of plum seed after which the detailed design of the gasifier was done with the aid of solidworks. Materials were carefully selected and purchased based on availability, cost, thermal properties, mechanical properties, and their physical properties. The reactor system which consists of the reactor, pipes, and bends, shell in tube condenser, and thermocouple were fabricated. The performance evaluation of the gasifier was carried out, and various parameters such as operating time, start-up time, total operating time, fuel combustion rate, specific gasification rate, and combustion zone rate were obtained as 0.167 h, 1.17 h, 1.417 h, 11.98 kg/h, 24.94 kg/m 2  h, and 4.7 (m/h) respectively. The heat load of the condenser, the logarithmic mean temperature difference (LMTD), mass flow velocity, Reynold’s number of fluid entering the condensing unit, and volume of burning chamber were also obtained as 145 kJ, 25 °C, 0.5 kg/s, 4.5448, and 0.062 m 3 , respectively.

Studies have shown improved outcomes and decreased length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay for patients treated in a dedicated neurologic intensive care unit (Neuro ICU), likely secondary to specialized nursing care, neurointensivist teams, and protocolized management of complex neurologic illness. When it comes to monitoring a patient in the Neuro ICU, there is a wide variety of tools and parameters we record to help guide treatment plans and communicate prognostic information to patients and families. Some examples of neuromonitoring typically performed in a Neuro ICU include intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), transcranial Doppler (TCD), electroencephalograms (EEGs), brain tissue oxygenation, and pupillometry. The purpose of monitoring patients in the neurocritical care unit is to detect, prevent, and treat reversible causes of further brain injury. In our patient population, this information is often complicated, and misinterpretation can lead to inaccurate diagnosis and treatment. In this chapter, we discuss how the data we collect can be translated to the clinical context with some case presentations to exemplify the complexities of monitoring and managing patients with severe neurologic disease.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Anesthesiology', 'Neurosurgery', 'Pain Medicine']"

Despite the implementation of public policies aimed at its formalization in the educational structure, and the promotion of technological development and the digital ecosystem, the new generations have not been actively involved. The incorporation of playful elements has a dynamic effect on literacy processes, promoting the development of skills and competencies that influence learning. Through a systematic review (PRISMA-P) of the scientific literature on health literacy and its relationship with games, this article provides a specific and structured synthesis of the empirical studies published in the last 10 years, identifying contributions and patterns between multidisciplinary contributions, with a particular focus on the combination between gamification and serious games. We concluded that immersion in a playful experience favors the emotional and cognitive learning of the player.

A larger number of participants participate in the selection of the location for the landfill, i.e. it is a matter of group decision-making. The choice of location for municipal waste disposal should be a balance between different conflict criteria. Criteria for the evaluation of municipal solid waste landfills based on the recommendations of the European Union and Directive 1999/31/EC were used.

The conceptual model relied on the measured hydro-geological data and boundary conditions related to hydraulic conductivity, storage coefficient, specific yield, general head, recharge and river boundary. The model calibration yields a linear correlation coefficient of 0.978 for flow model and 0.947 for the transport model. Sensitivity analysis of the calibrated model shows that migration of fluoride is more susceptible to changes in hydraulic conductivity than other input parameters. From the scenario analysis of the conceptual model, different rates of fluoride migration in different stratigraphic layers of the aquifer have been observed. The simulation results inferred that horizontal migration of fluoride had made the surroundings of the contaminated aquifer unsafe for drinking water and irrigation purposes. From both scenario and sensitivity analyses, it has been found that some common hydrologic phenomenon prevails in subsurface environment of the study area that leads to enrichment and migration of fluoride from the contaminated zone to the other part of the model domain along with groundwater flow.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Water, general', 'Ecology', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology', 'Environmental and Sustainability Education']"

For this purpose, the crack growth behavior is observed on rubber test specimens with various of the amounts of CB. Then, the images recorded with a high-speed camera are analyzed by using digital image correlation (DIC). From this experiment, the relationship between tearing energy and crack growth rate is obtained for NR. It is revealed only the specimen filled the most CB is not broken.

In 2021, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control issued alarming new data indicating that the rate of autism among American eight-year-old children had risen again, this time to 1 in 44, or about 2.3% (American Psychiatric Association in Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders. Arlington [ 1 ]). Many studies prove the effectiveness and positive impact of using smart telephones, mobile apps, and computer games to practice skills as therapy for children with ASD (Meghan et al. in Pediatrics 141:335–345 [ 2 ]). This review summarizes some of the most interesting and accessible serious games described in the scientific literature and designed to improve the social and communication skills of infants and toddlers with ASD. Learning and playing games are fundamental to the development of children's social skills allowing them to form independent relationships with peers (Simonoff et al. in J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry 47(8):921–929 [ 3 ]). As autistic children often have difficulty with peer relationships (Gordon-Lipkin et al. in Pediatrics 141(4) [ 4 ]), developing game-based skills through computer-assisted solutions could be an essential tool for autistic children to improve their social performance. The results were identified through extensive literature search conducted in the Central and Eastern European Online Library (CEEOL), EBSCO: Academic Search Complete, EBSCO: eBook Academic Collection and ScienceDirect, Academic Search Complete, Health Source: Consumer Edition, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science and Wiley Online Library for a time period between 2006 and 2021 by using a combination of the following free-text terms: autism, ASD, social skills, serious games, computer games, education, communication, software, portable, computer-based.

The performed check by calculating the oscillations of a nonlinear system with a sinusoidal disturbance of increased amplitude in comparison with the calculations of random oscillations of the same system showed a high adequacy of the results obtained. The used method for determining the probabilistic characteristics of random oscillations of a nonlinear system based on the procedure of averaging over a set of implementations can be used in the future for probabilistic calculation of more complex nonlinear systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

The chapter explicitly links absurdity and hypernormalization to its ideological functioning and is based on Žižek’s theory of ideology as fantasy construction. In this theory, absurdity and its normalization can be understood to function ideologically and are maintained through the emergence and development of a fantasy of normality. This serves a strong psychological function, in providing a feeling of security and sense of self (i.e., ontological security).

This paper proposed a fractional-order proportional plus integral (FOPI) controller for effective voltage and frequency management in autonomous MG VSC systems. Because of their fractional features, FO controllers make the VSC system more resilient than traditional PI controllers. Along with the conventional PI controller K p and K i gains, the FOPI controller has an extra edge of flexibility “ λ ”. The FO controllers parameters are tuned using the quasi-oppositional salp swarm algorithm (QSSA), a novel metaheuristic process. A droop controller that utilizes the dynamic change in the droop coefficients is also used to condense power transient and enhance the systems dynamic response while operating in the islanded mode. Furthermore, simulating the MG system in MATLAB Simulink, the dynamic performance of the proposed controllers is validated for the various abrupt change in system condition such as different initial load switching conditions for unequal ratings of distributed generation inverter and the effect of momentary fault (i.e., double line to ground fault). This paper compares the performance of conventional droop with PI controllers in inner voltage and current controllers and the suggested QSSA optimized FOPI controller with modified droop controller for autonomous MG systems. The simulation findings showed that the MG performance has improved using the proposed controller.","['Engineering', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Energy Storage']"

Initially, an attempt was made to adopt the draft changes in their entirety, but it was met with fierce resistance from the legal community. As a result, the process of making changes to the Civil Code is still incomplete. In particular, the changes affected the law of obligations and contract law. However, important innovations took place in inheritance law and in a number of other sections of civil law.

The paper demonstrates empirically that this shift has two key characteristics: one, a relative decline in economic power of the developed capitalist economies (mainly in the West), together with the concomitant rise of emerging economies in the East in the world capitalist economy; and two, the movement of the geographical centre of capitalist development away from economies with relatively small populations to economies with massive populations. Inequality persists globally between high-income developed/Western economies and countries in the East with relatively low per capita incomes, but the gap is narrowing swiftly. This narrowing gap is most evident in some of the key emerging capitalist economies in the BRICS region. The combination of rising average per capita income in the emerging/BRICS economies and their high populations has unprecedented ecological consequences in terms of consumption of natural resources and generation of waste. The limits placed on global ecological damage which were evident during the earlier phase of capitalist development, confined as it was to sparsely populated regions of the world, are no longer holding. A stage in global history has reached where any further development of capitalism could create conditions of barbaric ecological collapse. The paradigm shift from ecologically damaging capitalism to a new model of socialism compatible with nature (ecological socialism) has become a historic necessity. This new model of socialism stands in opposition to the old Soviet style of socialism which was environmentally as destructive as capitalism. An alternative capitalist paradigm (green capitalism) is not feasible given the inherent conflict between nature and the imperative to maximise profits. The paper concludes by outlining a few key aspects of the path of eco-socialist transition.","['Economics', 'Natural Resource and Energy Economics', 'Public Policy', 'Climate, general', 'Economic Growth', 'Business and Management, general', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management']"

Among the gases responsible for global warming, methane and nitrous oxide are emitted from improperly stored manure. These gases have a 25 and 298 times greater impact on the climate, respectively, than carbon dioxide. However, the use of cow feces as a substrate for biogas plants allows, on the one hand, to reduce gaseous emissions during manure storage and, on the other hand, to produce “green” fuel (biomethane) and/or electricity and heat.

The Arctic city of Murmansk was chosen as the base region for the study. Six variants of the construction of the “floor—outer wall” node were considered. Thermal calculations for each of the options were performed using the Elcut 6.4 software. The calculation results are summarized in a single table and confirm the hypothesis of the relevance of using a double facade structure in a cold region. The relationship between the width of the buffer zone and the thermal conductivity of the double facade structure is found. With an increase in the buffer zone, the average temperature of the two inner surfaces increases systemically, and, accordingly, the difference in their temperatures decreases. The Double-Skin Facad creates the self-illuminated effect required for the Arctic regions and demonstrates sufficient energy efficiency.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology', 'Building Materials']"

Thousands of proteins involved in gene transcription, protein translation and degradation as well as the regulation of signal transduction contain O-GlcNAc. Brain is one of the tissues where O-GlcNAc is the most highly expressed and deletion of neuronal O-GlcNAc leads to death early in development. O-GlcNAc is also important for normal adult brain function, where dynamic processes like learning and memory at least in part depend on the modification of specific proteins by O-GlcNAc. Conversely, too much or too little O-GlcNAc in the brain contributes to several disorders including obesity, intellectual disability and Alzheimer’s disease. In this chapter, we describe the expression and regulation of O-GlcNAc in the nervous system.","['Biomedicine', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurochemistry']"

However, this contribution is relatively small in the countries of Middle East compared with other regions. In addition, previous literature focuses on examining the effect of IC on the performance of banks while other sectors received less attention. This research aims to examine the effect of value added intellectual capital (VAIC) and its components (Human capital efficiency (HCE), Structural capital efficiency (SCE), and capital employed efficiency (CEE)) on the performance of industrial and service sector of five countries in the Middle East. Data was collected from listed companies in the five selected countries in the Middle East. This research finds that VAIC has a significant effect on financial performance and CEE is the most important component of VAIC and has strong positive effect on ROA and MTBV. The effect of HCE, SCE, on both ROA, and MTBV was found to be insignificant. The findings are varied based on countries and sectors. Policy makers in the five selected countries need to pay more attention to the contribution that VAIC can make to the performance of their economies. The heavy dependence on financial capital and physical capital (observed in the CEE) that is common in these economies, should be redirected to the institutional and human intellectual categories (SCE and HCE).","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Business Information Systems']"

These signals have various applications that include the detection and prevention of arrythmia disease. But these signals are by default predicted with noise which leads to wrong classifications. To avoid noisy inference, numerous approaches for denoising ECG signals have been proposed, including adaptive filtering, wavelet methods, and empirical mode decomposition. Our motive is to illustrate supremacy of clinical practice by demonstrating enhanced denoising as well as compression performance. Here, we offer a new /emphFCN-based denoising technique for ECG data in this study. DAE is well known for its ability to learn low-dimensional representations and for its ability in recreating noise-free data. To eliminate noises from the noise-corrupted ECG data, we propose an FCN-based DAE. As a result, the experiment’s findings reveal that FCN is superior with the lower RMSE, PRD and greater SNRimp. This denoising approach has a low computing complexity and is quite accurate.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Big Data', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks']"

Integration of these lacO sequences into a genomic region of interest allows to monitor the functional consequences of HAT/HDAC targeting on chromatin (de)compaction, histone modification, and interaction with other proteins by quantitative light microscopy, as described here. As DNA-binding of LacI can be tightly controlled by the addition of galactose-derivatives, this method also allows to monitor the effects of locus-specific recruitment in a time-resolved manner.","['Life Sciences', 'Protein Science', 'Enzymology']"

The direct method provides the overall efficiency based on input and output while indirect method shows the losses in each process which is more valuable in identify the inefficient process. Therefore, in this study, the effect of different boiler load on the efficiency of the boiler is analyzed using both methods. In addition, the analysis using indirect method also shows the effect of boiler load on the losses in dry flue gas and moisture in air. Data of the temperature, pressure and flow rate of the steam, flue gas, air and fuel are measured onsite. The flue gas analysis was performed to obtain the percentage of flue gas components. Direct efficiency and indirect efficiency based on heat losses at different points were calculated. From the study, it is found that, the efficiency of the boiler increased with the increment of boiler load and reach the maximum efficiency of 83.3% for direct method and 89.8% for indirect method at 55% load. Operating above 55% load will results in the decrement of boiler efficiency for both direct and indirect method. As the load increase, the amount of excess air is increasing which increase the combustion efficiency. However, as the excess air quantity increased further, the heat loss due to the excess air is higher than the heat input by the combustion therefore decreased the efficiency of the boiler. This result could give a clue to the boiler operator to tune the excess air rate when operating the boiler more than 55% load.","['Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Energy Storage']"

Drawing on the literature on prostitution policy in Europe, the feminist literature on prostitution and trafficking in women and EU Gender Studies, I argue that the EP’s neo-abolitionist turn can be explained by the coalescence in the mid-1990s of three key factors: Sweden’s accession to the EU and the attendant positioning of Swedish feminist neo-abolitionist norm entrepreneurs in central positions of power within EU institutions; the consolidation of a feminist neo-abolitionist velvet triangle through the creation of strong institutional links between the EC, EP and EWL, which remained unchallenged, and the articulation of a neoliberal model of gender and sexual emancipation within the violence against women policies of the EU that strongly resonated with neo-abolitionist ideals, all the while neo-abolitionism itself became gradually associated to gender equality as a fundamental EU value. In addition, I argue that this proclivity of the EU’s violence against women policies towards neo-abolitionism results from the operation of what I call the neoliberalism–vulnerability–security nexus , to refer to the imbrication of security as a technology of neoliberal governmentality, through the related role of the notion of vulnerability, with the gender and sexual politics of neoliberalism.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Politics and Gender', 'European Politics', 'International Security Studies']"

With this Marxist interpretation now considered, the discussion moves to what is not oneness including intersectionality and or autonomous cultures . This chapter also includes a very critical response to the oneness position by United Kingdom Marxists of Education (UKME). This accounting is important because as opposed to simply agreeing or disagreeing with the position of oneness, the reader can engage with alternative or opposing points of views as well. However, if the oneness point of view is going to have a significant effect in challenging the status quo and moving toward a more equitable society, the implications of oneness for an extended Marxism are included (e.g., ideology , the dialectic , and related topics).

This chapter will begin with an overview of mental illness and the main links with employment. The self-selection or social drift hypothesis suggests that people with mental illness face higher risks of employment difficulties due to various disadvantages. The social causation hypothesis suggests that certain characteristics of workplaces can trigger or worsen mental illness. The relevance of these explanations depends on the type of mental illness that is being considered. Using common mental disorders, psychotic disorders, and youth mental health as examples, the evidence relating to these arguments is illustrated. Responses to them include anti-stigma campaigns, early intervention for mental illness, supported employment models, workplace awareness, stress alleviation and general well-being programs, occupational health interventions, and policies targeting employment practices. Mental illness and employment are also indirectly linked through their impacts on carers (caregivers), family members, and colleagues. Evidence on these links and responses comes mainly from high-income countries, and a great deal remains unknown in low- and middle-income countries. The COVID-19 pandemic brought further uncertainties regarding macroeconomic recession and new work practices, affecting jobs and employee mental health.

Here, we propose the design of a miniaturized AFM scan head for 3-axis nano-positioning. The scan head uses parallelogram-based flexures for amplifying displacements in-plane and a bridge-type displacement amplifier for out-of-plane positioning and achieves a displacement range of ±5 μm along X -, Y - and Z -axes. Subsequently, a lumped parameter model has been obtained for analysing the quasi-static and dynamic characteristics of the different subsystems of the positioner. A comparison of the analytical expressions for the displacement gain and eigen frequencies with Finite Element (FE) analysis revealed match to within 4%. The bandwidth along Z -axis is about 5 kHz, which is much larger than that of a conventional AFM scan head. Finally, a feedback control system has been designed to achieve position control using model inversion.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics']"

Localizing the cause of comprehension in either the reader or the text is fraught with contradictions. A proposed solution uses a Rasch equation to models comprehension as the difference between a reader measure and text measure. Computing such a difference requires that reader and text are measured on a common scale. Thus, the puzzle is solved by positing a single continuum along which texts and readers can be conjointly ordered. A reader’s comprehension of a text is a function of the difference between reader ability and text readability. This solution forces recognition that generalizations about reader performance can be text independent (reader ability) or text dependent (comprehension). The article explores how reader ability and text readability can be measured on a single continuum, and the implications that this formulation holds for reading theory, the teaching of reading, and the testing of reading.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Education, general', 'Psychometrics', 'Applied Statistics']"

This chapter introduces vehicle interior noise generation mechanisms, including air-borne and structure-borne noises. An automobile is a complex vibration system with multiple excitation sources (engine, intake/exhaust system, transmission system, tire/road excitation, vehicle body, and wind noise) which deliver vibrational energy to multiple target points through different transfer paths. Several transfer path analysis methods are introduced to identify the transmission and contribution of each vibration/ noise source. Furthermore, the vibration/noise prediction methods based on the model and data are discussed. Under varying high-speed conditions, the vehicle interior noises are nonlinear and nonstationary. Based on machine learning and compressed sensing approaches, the so-called signal decomposition optimization-based back propagation neural network for ear-side noise reconstruction (DBENR) and the multi-variable based time-domain signal reconstruction (MTSR) are introduced for vehicle interior noise. The research results suggest that the two methods can effectively reconstruct the nonlinear and nonstationary vehicle interior noise signals and may provide high-precision reference signals for vehicle active noise control.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Engineering Acoustics', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing']"

However, such methods often require the human teacher to know what is the correct action that the agent should take. In other words, if the human teacher is not always reliable, then it will not be consistently able to guide the agent through its training. In this paper, we propose a more effective interactive reinforcement learning system by introducing multiple trainers, namely Multi-Trainer Interactive Reinforcement Learning (MTIRL), which could aggregate the binary feedback from multiple non-perfect trainers into a more reliable reward for an agent training in a reward-sparse environment. In particular, our trainer feedback aggregation experiments show that our aggregation method has the best accuracy when compared with the majority voting, the weighted voting, and the Bayesian method. Finally, we conduct a grid-world experiment to show that the policy trained by the MTIRL with the review model is closer to the optimal policy than that without a review model.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Due to this, the development of highly efficient detection and remediation technologies is required to assess the contamination by EOCs. Traditional detection methods and remediation technologies have some major drawbacks, like high-cost and time-intensive methodologies that are needed to overcome to assess the growing contamination of marine environments. The use of electrochemical sensors, especially electrochemical biosensors, is a promising alternative for in situ monitoring the concentration of EOCs. Regarding the degradation of EOCs, the role of technologies employed at WWTPs is crucial to reduce the discharge of contaminants to marine ecosystems.

To teach these concepts, instructors often adopt a theoretical approach because replicating the dynamic conditions of construction projects within the classroom is challenging. This paper describes a management game approach to teach undergraduate civil engineering students how to plan and control construction project performance. The management game objective is to construct a major project comprising three bridges, 4 km dual-carriageway highway, drainage system, and culverts over a 60-week contract period and to achieve maximum profit. The project details are available through drawings, a longitudinal profile, productivity data, rates and resource costs. Once students have completed their preliminary program, they are required to submit their plans for the first 12-weeks. Each submission contains the tasks the group chooses to complete and the resources necessary. Once the order request is submitted, the game controller informs on resource utilization (over/under-ordered), costs incurred, payments received, and whether the groups could complete the tasks. A risk affecting the project performance, such as adverse weather or equipment non-availability, is randomly selected from a predefined list. Each student group is required to formulate resolution strategies to address the selected risk. This process of randomly selecting a risk and formulating a resolution is repeated five times, and students are assessed based on their ability to make profits and complete all tasks. Based on student feedback, the management game engages students, develops their decision-making skills, and facilitates their understanding of key concepts on project planning and control.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

Based on various schemes of interaction between the wheel and the rail, determined by railway track operating conditions, the advantages and disadvantages of various contact schemes are revealed. The necessity of forming asymmetric rails profiles is indicated and the concept of conformal wheel-rail contact is considered. The conformal contact occurs when the running rail fillet and the wheel flange wear down to common profile due to intense flange contact at the curves. Due to the conformal contact, the relative slip expands the contact zone, the specific pressure decreases, meanwhile the rail and wheel profiles, worn to the corresponding configuration, successfully show good performance in terms of fatigue endurance. Thus, it is recommended that the wheel and rail profiles are conformal. Such a profile can be given to wheels and rails during current maintenance; the rails can be tramped or profiled immediately after railing. It is noted that this profile is approximately the same under various conditions of flange contact on different railways. Recommendations are given to reduce the intensity of rail wear in curved track sections based on the formation of asymmetric profiles of inner and outer rail faces. Based on the proposed recommendations for reducing the rail head wear, general principles of designing repair profiles have been developed in order to reduce their defects. The requirements for repair profile design are developed, taking into account the structural and operational characteristics of the railway track.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

One can imagine that there was a request to change this law to respond to society’s need for changes in the regulation of private relations at the end of the 20th century. In the Brazilian case, to understand the process that resulted in a new Civil Code, it is necessary to know much about the elaboration of the 1916 Civil Code, as well as when and why there were demands to replace it eighty years later. After considering these aspects, this contribution examines the debates on whether the 2002 Civil Code is actually a new code, or just an update of the 1916 Civil Code, and to what extent the 2002 Civil Code can be considered a law capable of regulating the Brazilian society in the twenty-first century. In fact, due to the passage of time, the 2002 Civil Code corresponds to the 1916 Civil Code as updated until the 1970s. The real impact of this new Civil Code on the regulation of private relations is then analyzed, explaining the reasons why some important articles of the Code were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, and what should have been done for the Civil Code to be able to respond to the current expectations regarding its ability to regulate private relations.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Civil Law', 'Fundamentals of Law']"

To recognize and reduce ENV in micro-level analysis such as sampling of works and balance charts explaining the balance of the asset is used broadly. These methods are particularly successful when analyzing operations with modest performance variance in each cycle and can discover redundant stages in highly repetitive building activity. Data is gathered through literature reviews and site visits. The main aim of this study is to construct a dynamic tool that can detect and enumerate ENV, and changes can be done in the design. This proposed model was then used in two case studies, it was discovered that errors and changes caused 18.61% ENV and if the project is delayed, there will be a delay of 128 days in the case of project I and 72 days in case project II. Furthermore, productivity loss and Interruption (RFIR) form the major part of ENV, causing delays in both the case studies. Based on the findings, this research stated that this proposed tool could be used as a device to improve ENV comprehension in projects, resulting in a more significant reduction in ENV.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Building Materials']"

Every wind turbine creates a low-speed, highly turbulent, plume-like airflow called a “wake.” To minimize the said losses, one needs to reduce the overall exposure to upstream turbines’ wakes. One can achieve this goal by optimizing the farm’s layout and actively controlling the parameters that can either steer or weaken the wake, such as yaw or pitch angles. Both practices, i.e., layout optimization and active yaw control, are still insufficient, leaving the wind farms as one of the least power-dense forms of plants with a power density of 1–2 W/m 2 . In this article, we propose the application of external vanes to steer the wake from downstream turbines in real time. While acknowledging that implementing this strategy with a current technology readiness level of 1 is not easy, this research only serves as a preliminary proof of concept demonstrating this idea’s effectiveness. The study utilized large-eddy simulations and an inline, three-turbine configuration. It revealed that a sizeable external vane between the front- and the second-row turbines increased the production of the second and third turbines by approximately 45% and 42%, respectively, which is significant compared to all other studied active wake control strategies.","['Energy', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Environmental and Sustainability Education', 'Sustainable Development', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Natural Resource and Energy Economics']"

The machine tool is considered in two modes of its operation: at idle and working strokes. Spindle bearings, heat fluxes from cutting fluid, heat fluxes from main engines are presented as the main heat sources. Basic data for convective and heat fluxes were taken according to the methods used in the calculations of machine tools. To obtain adequate models, the values ​​of heat and convective fluxes were refined from experimental data for temperatures and temperature displacements. Convective heat transfer in the thermal model of the machine tool was set for 450 surfaces. Heat fluxes were specified for 161 surfaces. The simulation of the thermal behavior of the machine tool was carried out for 6 h of its operation in the Ansys. The ten-node Solid227 element was used as a typical finite element. The problem of thermoelasticity was solved in a coupled formulation. The error in calculating thermal characteristics did not exceed 0.5 ℃, the error in calculating temperature displacements did not exceed 5 µm. The results of computer simulation confirmed the experimental relationships characteristic of this group of machine tools in the positions of the left and right grinding wheel. At idle, the mutual position of the grinding wheels can be attributed to the type of deformation as “below is wider”. On the working stroke, this deformation state can be represented as “below is narrowly”.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Mechatronics']"

The microchannel was shaped by machining 300 µm wide × 700 µm deep groove (i.e. a hydraulic diameter 420 µm) into the surface of brass block having length of 60 mm. The working fluid was deionized water. The experiments were conducted over range of mass flux from 300 to 600 kg/m 2 .sec, and heat flux (based on wall) from 5.4 to 376.5 kW/m 2 at the degree of sub-cooled (20 K and 35 K). The results found that the pressure drop and heat transfer values are dependent on the degree of inlet degree sub-cooled over the range of heat fluxes tested, wherever lower values of pressure drop and decreasing of heat transfer coefficient values were noted at higher degree of inlet degree of sub-cooled. However, the dominate mechanism of heat transfer is the nucleate and forced convection boiling for present work. The results of boiling pressure drop and heat transfer coefficient were compared with different micro scale correlation; these correlations predicted an acceptable reasonably well for the flow boiling characteristics.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks', 'Energy Storage']"

Polysaccharides are convenient biopolymeric carriers due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability. Furthermore, the hydroxy-, amino-, or carboxylic groups are predestinated for functionalization.

These everyday devices are distinct from traditional computers because they typically have notable constraints on their RAM, flash memory, and computational power. Due to these constraints, we believe that many of the proposed encryption schemes are too heavyweight to be employed in the IoT. In this paper we present a lightweight, flexible encryption scheme that relies on the one-way information loss property of a secure hash function. Our scheme imposes minimal computational and storage requirements, and imposes no non-negligible burdens on the encrypting device, except for the hash itself. We find that the encryption algorithm is particularly lightweight, and holds up strongly in terms of its speed and memory efficiency.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Agile supports an early return of investment that supports circular reinvesting and makes the product more adaptable to variable social-economical environments.

Project information requires an efficient record of the requirements, aims, governance not only for the investors, owners or users but also to keep evidence in future health and safety and other statutory compliance-related issues. In order to address the agile project management issues and address new safety regulations, this paper proposes a project information model (PIM) based on a distributed ledger technology (DLT) with a ranked procedure for the verification and validation (V&V) of data. Each V&V phase inserts a process of authenticity, data abstraction and analytics that adds value to the information founded on artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). The underlying DLT consists of smart contracts embedded on a private Ethereum blockchain. This approach supports a decentralised approach in which every project stakeholder owns, manages and stores the data.

Consequently, it becomes a challenge to evaluate and compare different locking schemes. The lack of a precise notion of security can be traced back to the following reasons. First, the security of existing locking schemes is highly dependent on the data to be locked, both in structure and in functionality. For example, the corrupted functional output for incorrect keys often includes hints to the key itself. Second, the structural changes induced by logic locking remain present in the Integrated Circuit (IC) even after activation is done. Both aspects enable a plethora of attack vectors, making it tremendously difficult to compile all relevant security properties into a single metric.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems']"

This leads to alterations of the neural activity in all the structures of the loop circuit formed by the cortex, the basal ganglia, and thalamus. These alterations are believed to underlie the bradykinesia and hypokinesia observed in Parkinson’s disease. To study the correlation or the causality between circuitry neural activity and specific parkinsonian motor symptoms, the circuit can be interrogated by simultaneous extracellular recordings in diverse brain structures in behaving freely moving animals modeling Parkinson’s disease. Hereby, we describe the procedure to obtain the classical 6-hydroxydopamine Parkinson’s model combined with multi-area extracellular recordings in small behaving animals to access the activity of the parkinsonian cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop. Given that both the dopaminergic lesion caused by 6-hydroxydopamine, and the quality of the extracellular recordings have temporal dynamics of their own, the relative timing of both procedures is essential to obtain successful recording with high-quality signals.","['Biomedicine', 'Neurosciences']"

To understand the impact of air pollutants on the tree species at the study area near the rural school. Studies are carried out to determine the physiological responses and biochemical changes in the selected tree species near the rural school. The objective is to identify tolerance and sensitive tree species near the rural school using the air pollution tolerance index (APTI). The leaf samples were collected from the selected tree species which were used to determine the APTI through the biochemical parameters such as pH, ascorbic acid, total chlorophyll and relative water content. The response of the plants toward air pollution is assessed through APTI; tolerant species found are Albizia saman and Azadirachta indica , intermediate species Ficus religiosa and Syzygium cumini are in the category of intermediate and Tectona grandis is found to be sensitive species. The selected species were subjected to API for evaluation of the performance of the tree to recommend it for the green belt development. Based on the APTI, biological and socioeconomic importance, the selected tree species were graded and categorized based on their performance.

Bearing all these aspects in mind, our overriding goal remains to make the traffic on our roads safer. Many of the activities in this context are summarized in the Mercedes-Benz “Vision of accident-free driving.” The current plateauing of road fatality statistics across the countries of the West is a clear signal that we need to intensify our efforts even further. And indeed, there are still plenty of levers that can be applied in order to optimize and improve these figures. Following a review of the current situation from the perspective of Mercedes-Benz, the opportunities for further optimization of vehicle safety are now presented in the guise of the latest Experimental Safety Vehicle, ESF 2019, which above all addresses the new possibilities offered by increasing connectivity and automation. Many of the innovative concepts under consideration have a chance of reaching the market in future vehicles, either as they are or in a modified form; in other cases the discussion around them will lead to new ideas and proposed solutions. The Integral Safety Strategy by Mercedes-Benz is a holistic approach that defines safety in four phases: (1) safe driving, (2) assisting in a critical driving situation with accident prevention systems and anticipatory protection elements such as PRE-SAFE® systems, (3) during a crash, for example, occupant and partner protection, and, finally, (4) after a crash, deploy systems for the rescue phase. All four phases must be high priorities during the development of the vehicle. Even with an optimistic view of the vehicle-based opportunities, this chapter will demonstrate that vehicle measures alone will not be sufficient to solve all traffic safety issues, as road transportation is just too complex. All the factors that impact road safety, and which will need to play their part in delivering “Vision Zero,” must be addressed; in other words, infrastructural measures and people in traffic, too. As with the Mercedes-Benz strategy of Integral Safety, we shall only be able to make major advances toward “Vision Zero” if all influencing factors are properly investigated as part of an integrated examination of road safety.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

MCD64A1 data was widely used and well detected in the wildfire area. But the underestimated results in agricultural fields were found in many studies. Because its capabilities of coarse spatial resolution cannot clearly detect small fire patches. This study aims to evaluate the MODIS burned area product and Sentinel-2 burned area for crop residue burning. Higher spatial of burned areas were analyzed by Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) from Sentinel-2 to compare with MODIS burned area product. The burned areas were overlayed with land uses and sugarcane plots in the production season 2018/2019 in Kalasin province and two districts of Udon Thani province. The estimation of the sugarcane harvesting period was done by NDVI derived from 15-day composite of Sentinel-2 imageries. The result showed that the total burned from Sentinel-2 had around 11 times higher than MCD64A1. The majority of detected burned areas of both sensors were detected in the paddy field. Additional, MCD64A1 has better performace to identify the forest burn area than the Sentinel-2 where as it is not suitable to detect the field crops which has relative smaller size. The study reports that most sugarcane in the study area was harvested in the first half of January 2019 with the cutting of fresh sugarcane, while burned harvest was mostly found in the first half of April 2019. Therefore, this study could fill the gap of present knowledge about crop residue burning over the region.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Applications', 'Geography, general', 'Sustainable Development']"

On the basis of the analysis of the existing literature sources devoted to the specified question the task of research of work of system of intermittent heat supply in the separate educational case is set. Before starting the simulation, make assumptions about the structure of the dynamics of the process of initial heating of the room by the heating system, namely the simultaneous heating of the air in the room and walls. This allowed us to formulate an approach to modeling heating processes. The approach to modeling the thermal regime of heating of public buildings is considered. A simplified analytical model of space heating dynamics based on its thermophysical parameters using the theory of nonstationary heat transfer has been developed. A comparison of the results of the experiment and calculations on the mathematical model is presented, the size of the discrepancy between the model and the calculations is established.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Sustainable Development', 'Renewable and Green Energy']"

Mokammel Today, numerous apps are being deployed on the blockchain to extend security and transparency. In order to cope with most of the real-world applications, blockchain is needed to be in its perfect state. For this purpose, the trilemma concept is addressed to emphasize the complete cooperation of decentralization, security and scalability without compromising any of these attributes. However, after years of revolution in the digital transaction sector, miners face serious scalability issues with Bitcoin’s peak limit of only 2–3 TPS. Furthermore, the ledger size of Bitcoin is on the way to exceeding 350 GB and growing exponentially. Among all other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is far ahead in terms of security and decentralization. However, it lacks proper scalability. Instead of being secure and decentralized enough, the Bitcoin blockchain cannot sustain any longer without scalability. In this paper, this trilemma problem is focused on making the Bitcoin scalable enough, so that a Bitcoin-like secure and decentralized blockchain can be adopted in real-life applications. A theoretical strategy for increasing throughput and reducing storage dependency is introduced in this paper. A solution for Bitcoin’s scalability issue in terms of throughput and storage, which uses IPFS and a dual-blockchain technique, is presented.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']"

The feature is an application of NLP (Natural Language Processing) that removes hotwords such as “Hey Google”, “Hey Siri”, and “Alexa”, allowing for natural voice interactions. The primary research goal is to validate the value proposition of Quick Commands for VUI (voice user interface) interactions in terms of usability defined as: feature helpfulness, naturalness, and comfort using the feature in public and private spaces. The study design included recruiting a group of over 80 users to test Quick Commands in different contexts, followed by a focus group of 18 users to provide detailed feedback. The study ran 1 week and encouraged users to test Quick Commands in scenarios with a range of ambient audio conditions (ranging from 50–80 dBA). During the week of testing participants completed check-in surveys at the mid-week point, at the end of the week, and then some participants in a focus group to debrief the study. These methods can be replicated to validate future NLP advances and Assistant features before implementing public facing applications. Results of this study demonstrate the value proposition for Quick Commands and user comfort with voice interactions in a range of audio environments.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Bosnia and Herzegovina, similarly to the rest of the world is committed to follow the trend of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by abandoning electricity production using conventional conversion technologies and renewable energy sources. Traditionally, educational institution facilities have poor energy performance of buildings and energy-inefficient devices. The aim of this paper is to present a techno-economic analysis of a hybrid system based on renewable energy sources for the needs of energy coverage of such an institution in Mostar. The system is designed for the building of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering in order to improve its energy efficiency. The model is constructed using realistic measurements performed at the facility. In particular, a grid-connected PV system technology and a ground source heat pump were used. Carbon dioxide emission reductions were calculated compared to the classic conventional heating and electricity production system. Results demonstrate that the proposed system can be used in order to improve the energy efficiency of the building.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The remaining energy of LiB is the very important parameter determined continuously by estimating LiB’s state of charge (SoC). SoC estimation is one of the main functions of the battery management systems (BMS). This article presents the use of two sigma-point Kalman filters (SPKF) to estimate accurately the SoC of the LiB based on the second-order model of the cell. The LiB’s average SoC and the zero bias of the current measurement through the LiB are estimated by the first SPKF, while the second filter is applied to calculate the SoC differences between LiB’s average SoC and the modules’ SoC in the LiB. To improve the SoC accuracy of the LiB modules, a second-order RC equivalent circuit model (SECM) of the cell is used, and the influences of temperature, voltage hysteric, measurement errors, and zero bias of current measurement on the SoC estimation of the LiB are taken into account. To verify the method, the experimental test is conducted in the LiB with cells connected in parallels and series. The simulation and experimental results are analyzed to prove that the SoC estimation of the modules in the LiB is higher accuracy, and the LiB’s average SoC errors are less than 1.5% at different temperatures ranging from − 5 to 45 ℃. The calculation time consuming is shorter, and the calculation complex is reduced significantly.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security']"

The rig-to-reef approach, successfully implemented in other seas of the world, provides an attractive alternative to the complete removal by reefing the underwater oilrig structures and theoretically provides positive environmental, economic, and social benefits to a wide range of stakeholders. This manuscript critically reports and analyzes the risks associated with the implementation of the rig-to-reef approach in Qatar oilfields by using a DPSIR conceptual framework focusing on the pressures, states, impacts, and responses. By portraying reefing approaches as an issue, several pressures were identified including potential navigational safety issue, pollution, and physical disturbances. These pressures are expected to modify the physical, biological, and chemical state of the ecosystems, potentially leading to several impacts, such as the loss of habitats, biodiversity, and associated ecosystem services. The identified hazards and their potential risks were analyzed, and these seemed to be outweighed by the potential benefits of reefing obsolete oil platforms. Nevertheless, the critical impairment to the rig-to-reef implementation, mainly associated to existing regulatory frameworks, should be addressed.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Sustainable Development', 'Development Studies', 'Middle Eastern Politics']"

Determining this soluble metal in water has been a challenge to Marinduqueños as there is no water testing laboratory available. This research aims to develop a system that determines soluble Copper (Cu) in water through color reaction analysis of tannins. Specifically, it aims to develop a system that determines copper in water and evaluate the developed system through comparative analysis from laboratory results. An image processing box was prepared to record the color reaction of tannins to water solutions containing 0.5 to 5 ppm soluble copper. The recorded reactions were analyzed for their RGB channels. The RGB color values were then related to the copper concentrations. To assess the reliability of the system, water samples with unknown metal contents were tested using the system. Based on these procedures, it was found that copper produces green and blue colors, especially for the water solutions with 2.0 to 3.5 ppm of copper. It was concluded that the system can determine the soluble copper in water samples (from 0.5 ppm to 5 ppm), but calibration must be done using genetic algorithm optimization features and other ways such as machine vision. Relevant to analytic chemistry, it is recommended that titrimetric conditioning and use of the Sigmoid function be performed to improve color resolution.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Therefore, it is important to implement sustainability principles during maintenance activities, such as reducing material usage. Proper maintenance of a facility impacts the lifecycle sustainability of a project by increasing the usable life of the facility and improving its energy efficiency. Like many building owners, the United States (US) Department of Defense (DoD) has sustainability goals and policies to reduce the environmental impact of their buildings. This study reviewed 28,790 work orders from 272 military office facilities across the US and around the world to reveal material consumption during maintenance and the impact of preventative maintenance (PM) on reducing corrective maintenance (CM) requirements. The study found that heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) maintenance consumes the most material per work order, with material accounting for 43% of the average work order cost. Both HVAC and painting had the greatest average material cost per corrective maintenance work order, at $277 and $254 respectively, suggesting a higher consumption of material than other crafts studied. This study contributes to an understanding of the proportion of a typical work order cost that is material cost and to quantifying the relationship between PM and CM. This research applies to office buildings maintenance decisions, particularly material selection. For owners to improve the sustainability of buildings, they must reduce material and energy consumption during facility O&M which starts with design decisions and continues through maintenance prioritization.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"
doi:10.1007/978-981-19-0503-2_42,en,Fuzzy Art: Pattern Recognition of Wifi Detected Occupancy in Commercial Buildings,OriginalPaper,"Research that predicts occupancy patterns in commercial buildings has gained in significance ever since the influence of occupants on building energy consumption became evident. Studies have employed a variety of sensory systems to collect the occupancy data and understand human behaviors throughout buildings. However, establishing a dedicated sensor network to collect occupancy data can become expensive for building owners. In this context, obtaining occupancy data from an existing WiFi network could eliminate the cost concerns. Data within the WiFi routers provide sufficient information for accurate estimates of occupancy. To estimate occupancy levels, this work proposes to learn and recognize WiFi connection using an Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) artificial neural network. A detailed understanding of occupancy patterns using the WiFi data is helpful for developing heating and cooling schedules that optimize HVAC energy consumption. For this study, occupancy data was collected over a 17-week semester at the University of New Mexico using existing WiFi routers located in a large lecture hall used by multiple classes. This data was used to learn patterns of repetition using the neural network. The results show that if the 24-h occupancy profiles can be subdivided into smaller time segments defined by external schedules such as lecture start and end times or other constraints, significant patterns can be detected. A detailed understanding of these patterns can greatly facilitate occupancy load forecasting for effective building management (e.g. HVAC operation).","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

The common thread is upregulation and downregulation of critical neuroreceptors. Each of these brain maladies is associated with a specific brain area whose neurons’ firing rates determine normalcy or affliction. For example, anxiety is caused by the relevant neurons having an abnormally low homeostatic firing rate. Excitatory drugs can provide relief by raising the rate above homeostatic. Another example is depression caused by an abnormally elevated level of glutamate, which is excitatory. A higher than homeostatic firing rate can be lowered by use of the drug Ketamine, an NMDA antagonist that diminishes the binding of glutamate to the NMDA receptors. Without this drug, nature’s % Hebbian-LMS algorithm alone is not strong enough to enforce homeostasis, but with Ketamine together, relief is possible. Another example is bipolar disorder. When the relevant neurons fire at the homeostatic rate, the mood is normal. Above the rate, there is mania, below this rate gives depression. Lithium sulfate treats this disorder. It does not seem to raise or lower the rate. How it works is not understood. It is speculated here that it increases the parameter $$\mu $$ μ of the % Hebbian-LMS allowing it to pull the firing rate closer to homeostatic with smaller error. Schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease are further examples of disorders that can be mitigated by control of receptor populations.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Complex Systems', 'Machine Learning']"

Coverage : through eligibility of Medicare for those >65 years of age, disabled, as well as those with end-stage renal disease and amyotropic lateral sclerosis. Benefits : Medicare alphabet soup provides Parts A–D where A includes hospital, skilled nursing facilities short term, and hospice; B includes provider services; C are the benefits of A + B provided through a managed care organization under Medicare Advantage (MA); and D provides prescription drugs. Whereas Medicaid covers skilled nursing facilities long term as well as the out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses of Medicare. These OOPs can also be covered through Medigap coverage. Care delivery is especially confusing given the changes occurring in shifting from volume to value-based payment models as well as the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Of the three factors – coverage, benefits, and delivery – coverage eligible is the most stable element, while benefits are adjusted annually and delivery is rapidly undergoing change currently.

From a technological point of view, it is a determining factor of the effectiveness, magnitude, and nature of the interaction among any biological system with outer substances, and therefore it is a key factor in the bioactivity of materials. With the development of nanotechnology, the study and interest about biointerfaces, both biotic and abiotic, has grown enormously since the applications in the biomedical, microbiological, analytical, and pharmacological fields are very varied and promising. From the nanotechnology perspective, a biointerface is not only defined as a determining barrier of the surface and contact properties of biosystems, but also it is one more component that can be designed and controlled for specific purposes. In the field of nanomaterials, e.g., metallic nanoparticles, the biointerface can be defined between the metallic core and the capping agent, which can be a biomolecule, but at the same time it can be conceptualized between the capping agent and a cell, a biological fluid, or some living tissue. In this chapter, the main concepts, manufacture, study, control, and applications of nanobiointerfaces obtained from inorganic nanomaterials, with particular emphasis in the aspects related to modulating their bioactivity are described.","['Materials Science', 'Nanotechnology', 'Sustainable Development']"

The increase in negative environmental factors, i.e. the change in the Earth's climate due to excessive emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere, which are caused by energy companies when burning fossil fuels—coal, oil and gas. This is the main contradiction, which in the near future may negatively affect the sustainable development of the country's economy. The environmental protection system in force in the country is ineffective: deductions to the state budget of payments and fines for environmental pollution are insufficient to restore the natural environment. In this regard, it is necessary to conduct an effective environmental policy in the industries, to develop economic mechanisms to reduce the negative impact of the complex enterprises on the environment. The dynamically developing economy of Russia is ensured by the sustainable functioning and development of electricity production, which occurs due to the enormous damage to the environment. The novelty of the research is determined by the implementation of the concept of Russia's transition to sustainable development, which will ensure the gradual introduction into the economy of an ecologically ideal industrial production structure that excludes environmental pollution.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

The method adopts a tool designed ad hoc to collect data regarding the urban experience and represent the outcomes in various forms, including the cartographic one. The procedure includes a virtual exploration of an area through spherical panoramas and a survey investigating the area’s emotional and cognitive effects from specific points of view. An open discussion on the results with the 38 international students participating in the survey concluded the workshop. In particular, the collected individual reactions to the scenes were clustered, and the average emotional and cognitive results associated with the specific viewpoints were analyzed and discussed. Results show that some particular visual perspective constitutes robust social attractors characterized by intense emotional and cognitive reactions, whereas other points of view in the surroundings are socially negligible and emotionally neutral.

Cargo must be routed efficiently through the network and assigned to vehicles. The resulting problem can be modeled as a network flow problem. Additionally, constraints such as varying capacities due to fluctuations in passenger numbers during the day must be considered. These numbers, as well as the demand for cargo transports, are assumed to be stochastic and therefore considered in a simulation study. To solve this problem, a hybrid simulation and optimization approach are presented. The deterministic network flow problem is solved to optimality with the help of a commercial solver. A simulator uses this solution to assign transport units to vehicles and determine a route through the network. As soon as the solution becomes infeasible, the deterministic problem is resolved with the current parameters. The new solution serves once again as an input for the simulation. This approach is expected to be more efficient compared to considering scenarios for every possible form of uncertainty.","['Engineering', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

Gender perspective, gender mainstreaming, gender identity, gender and law are now common terms. However, do we know what we refer to when using the term gender? Frequently, simple questions like, What is your gender? or What is your sex? can be difficult to answer when we realize that the term gender is used in the same context as sex to refer to male and female or masculine and feminine. Gender can also be used to refer to sexual harassment, social sex, cultural oppression, and even as a synonym for woman. Furthermore, for some, gender is a binary, while for others, it reflects fluidity and diversity. These various approaches to the concept of gender appear to complicate its use in law which prefers established normative factual concepts. Therefore, what is the meaning of gender in law? Avoiding the misleading use of gender requires shedding some light on the concept and term and its development within feminism and in law.","['Law', 'Theories of Law, Philosophy of Law, Legal History', 'Gender Studies']"

Several are the techniques available for measuring displacements, water pressures and total stresses, not only in these geotechnical structures but also at their foundations. Materials testing has been used for calibrating models for structural design and behavior prediction, and these models can be validated with instrumentation data as well. Relatively recent investigation on the behavior of these materials considering their degree of saturation focuses on monitoring the evolution of water content or suction as function of soil-atmosphere interaction, necessary to predict cyclic and/or accumulated displacements, and has huge potential to predict the impact of climate changes on the performance of existing geotechnical structures. This new need justifies the investment on developing sensors able to be used for in situ monitoring of water in the soils, such as those presented here. Testing and monitoring becomes even more important nowadays when, for sustainability purposes, traditional construction materials are replaced by other geo-materials with unknown behavior and long-term performance (mainly accumulated displacements). Existing experimental protocols and monitoring equipment are used for such cases, however new techniques must be developed to deal with particular behaviors. Three case studies are presented and discussion is made on monitoring equipment used and how monitored data helped understanding the behaviors observed.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering']"

Complex thinking should include the ability to see and analyze issues from all levels of analysis, from the micro, meso, and macro levels. However, no studies measure multilevel thinking in cognitive complexity. Because of the complexities involved in international business, cognitive complexity is particularly important when global managers deal with multifaceted international business management issues like the management of organizational behavior in terms of, for instance, communication, motivation, leadership, conflict, and negotiation. Although global managers deal with these issues daily, cognitive complexity is not yet studied in relation to the level of complexity with which managers think about these issues. This paper argues the need to revise the conceptualization and operationalization of cognitive complexity to cover the full complexity of managerial thinking. Therefore, measurement of managers’ cognitive complexity as it relates to a particular issue should include analysis of their thinking at the micro, meso, and macro levels. The paper also argues that such measurement requires measurement methods like cognitive mapping, which has several advantages over other methods. This study fills a gap in the research by proposing an assessment of multilevel thinking using cognitive maps to measure managers’ cognitive complexity in addressing issues like the management of international organizational behavior.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Business and Management, general', 'Computational Intelligence']"

When digital capabilities were lacking in the past, the complexity and operational inefficiencies of supply chains led to a lack of visibility and a high vulnerability to supply chain disruptions. The world’s logistics service providers as intermediates between carriers and shippers find themselves at the forefront of responding to arising needs in the supply chain space. At the latest since the COVID-19 crisis—and the resulting volatile environments with dwindling reliability of carriers and their schedules—lack of visibility has become a top priority to solve for businesses and their logistics partners. In response to the current tense situation in global trade—especially for sea freight operations—logistics providers must come up with technology solutions for risk mitigation and highly resilient supply chains. In spite of technological advances, supply chain visibility is not a standard to achieve easily, given the many different parties involved in global supply chains. Using a real-world example, this chapter outlines recent developments in customers’ expectations for real-time visibility and predictive analytics capabilities from their logistics providers. Utilizing data and information from internal sources, we analyze two of Kuehne+Nagel’s tools for enhancing resilience of its customers’ supply chains with a particular focus on sea freight operations. The focus of consideration is a digital planning platform for sea freight operations on the one hand and a real-time exception monitoring solution that enables proactive container management on the other. We will use these tools to illuminate how one of the leading logistics service providers responds to customers’ visibility needs and how this contributes to increased supply chain resilience.","['Business and Management', 'Supply Chain Management', 'Risk Management', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Operations Management']"

The toxic effects of phosphorylated tau are likely mediated by interacting proteins; however, methods to identify these interacting proteins comprehensively in human brain tissue are limited. Here, we describe a method that enables the efficient identification of hundreds of proteins that interact with phosphorylated tau (pTau), using affinity purification–mass spectrometry (AP-MS) on human, fresh-frozen brain tissue from donors with AD. Tissue is homogenized using a gentle technique that preserves protein–protein interactions, and co-immunoprecipitation of pTau and its interacting proteins is performed using the PHF1 antibody. The resulting protein interactors are then identified using label-free quantitative liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS. The Significance Analysis of INTeractome (SAINT) algorithm is used to determine which proteins significantly interact with pTau.

However, it is mandatory to ensure the correct microclimate for the conservation of perishable artifacts. The temperature and humidity conditions in the exhibition rooms must be compatible with each item. In this regard, each of them requires specific conditions, which sometimes could be vastly different from those of thermal comfort for people. The cultural heritage material is the parameter that most determines both the optimal average conditions and the allowed range of variability. Such requirements are widely described in the literature. Conversely, the energy demands, energy cost and comfort conditions are parameters that depend on the specific complexity of each case study, as they are linked to the local climate, the characteristics of the buildings and the energy policy of each country. Therefore, for the purpose of this research, a specific case study in the town of Split (Croatia) was selected. A simplified energy model of a museum was used to assess how much the microclimatic needs of the various items affect the energy demands. The boundary conditions were determined by the intersection between the need to preserve the cultural heritage and guarantee thermal comfort of visitors. Materials for which this compromise cannot be achieved have been identified. They represent the items that must be kept in air-conditioned showcases. Finally, the costs were estimated for different types of energy systems.

This approach offers an alternative to conventional university entrance criteria, establishing a means to better advice prospect university students on which degree streamline they are best suited for based on their displayed abilities. This will assist in the measures taken to reduce student attrition at universities. Student skill-sets are composed of pre-college marks (high school leaving results and National Benchmark Test scores) and home language. The composition of skill-sets is based on key student abilities associated with student university performance, and these are characterised as follows: mathematical ability, computer proficiency, academic literacy and language communication. The best performing prediction model proved to be the random forest classifier which gave an accuracy of 95%. This research, conducted at a South African research intensive institute, shows that skill-sets can be used as an alternative to current university entrance requirements as they provide a more holistic view of a student’s ability.

Therefore, advanced analytical approaches, involving LC–MS, are required to quantify these molecules in plasma, tissues, and other matrices. It has been shown that endocannabinoid congeners synthesized from n-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), such as docosahexaenoylethanolamide (DHEA) and eicosapentaenoylethanolamide (EPEA), have interesting immunomodulatory and tumor-inhibiting properties.

The above class of alloy which had a dendritic coring was subjected to corrosion and stress corrosion cracking tests in sodium chloride solution to check the effect of such coring on its corrosion behavior. Microstructural analysis of the material was carried out in all three grain orientations to observe the cast structure which can influence its corrosion characteristics. Potentiodynamic polarization study was carried out to find the resistance of the alloy against induced corrosion. Similarly, analysis of corrosion morphology and SCC was carried using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and slow strain rate test (SSRT). Fracture morphology was studied using SEM to investigate the mechanism of fracture. The results thus obtained realizes that, the presence of dendritic coring resulted in severe localized corrosion of the alloy. This heterogeneous microstructure increased the corrosion initiation at a faster rate during the SCC test. The formation of localized corrosion pits increased the stress intensity causing sudden mechanical failure during SSRT. The present study emphasizes the importance of analyzing microstructure during forging operations which can affect the localized corrosion resistance of the alloy and indirectly affects its mechanical behavior when exposed to corrosive environment.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Engineering Design']"

Reducing friction and controlling wear is a significant issue from the standpoints of both energy savings and environmental preservation. PVD hard coatings are well known for improving the characteristics of surfaces by reducing friction and increasing wear resistance. However, plastic deformation of the substrate frequently limits their performance. The introduction of duplex surface engineering, which involves treating substrates prior to coating, was a revolutionary way to improve subsurface qualities. A new attempt has been investigated in this work with respect to PVD coating on boronized surfaces to improve these properties. As a result, a thin layer of TiN coating was deposited on boronized samples of AISI 1045 and AISI 4142 steels. Although the TiN coating was considered to be the conventional coating, it was observed to have good compatibility with the boronized surface. The results of microhardness, micro abrasion wear, XRD, and micro-chemical analysis of the treated samples were assessed in this study. When comparing duplex-treated samples to untreated substrates, it was revealed that the duplex-treated samples had a considerable increase in hardness and wear performance. The XRD patterns verified the presence of cubic boron nitride phases, which are responsible for the steels’ enhanced hardness and wear resistance.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Engineering Design']"

From the earliest of times, in all cultures and traditions, the search for meaning and knowledge has been accompanied by a passing on through generations of ways that meaning can be made and connections drawn or discarded. The oral histories steeped in ancient ancestry of Indigenous peoples, and the written tomes that have influenced many a religious, spiritual, and belief system, all have their place in establishing a moral philosophy and body of ethical theory that provides rich fodder for those who seek explanations and answers to the compelling questions of life. This chapter focuses on tracing the history, defining and understanding the central tenets of what has become known as an Ethic of Care. This relational ethical theory had its roots in feminist thinking in the mid-twentieth century providing a critical understanding of the importance of interdependence and relationship while maintaining focus on the situational, structural, and political factors of importance to the individual. While ethics of justice highlight obligations, rights, and fairness, an Ethic of Care focuses on reciprocity, relationships, connections, and context. This chapter positions an Ethic of Care as a central ethical theory for social work practice and provides examples of how questions about what a compassionate response requires can shift what ought to be done from a focus on rational-objective to the relational-emotional dimension. In doing so, social workers have a foundation for decision-making that holds them on firm footing when exploring moral obligations, deservedness, and the expectations about how social relations play out on all levels.

However, integrating energy harvester in an urban landscape poses a significant challenge. This study developed a wind turbine, a bio-inspired savonius that will blend with the environment. Savonius wind turbine is a vertical-axis wind turbine type used to convert wind force into torque on a rotating shaft. Using SolidWorks flow simulation, the different configuration was considered such as twist angle and guide vanes. Simulation shows a promising potential of this turbine. A scaled prototype was made and tested. Results showed that a 135° angle of twist with guide vanes is ideal and has the highest torque during its running condition in theoretical data. When it is made into a prototype, its actual torque proves to be lower than its theoretical torque. The actual data presents a promising power efficiency of 32.45%, higher than the usual average range for savonious wind turbines.","['Engineering', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation']"

Three main factors affecting the value of the residual bearing capacity of the elements have been identified. A three-level and three-factor experiment plan named after Box-Benkin was created, which made it possible to statistically substantiate the results (within the variation of variable factors) in the research of only 15 experimental columns. The proposed method for determining the residual bearing capacity was based on the main provisions of the Eurocode and the current standards and extends their effect to the case of oblique eccentricity compression caused not by the presence of eccentricities in the application of compressive force in two planes, but by concrete damage at a certain length of the element height. The main assumptions and prerequisites for calculating the bearing capacity have been developed and substantiated. Two types of damage are considered: axial - when the damage front is parallel to one of the main axes of the cross section and damage at an angle - when the precondition wasn’t met.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Sustainable Development', 'Renewable and Green Energy']"

Players in this arena include the so-called Western actors such as the European Union (EU) and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as well as major regional powers such as Russia and China. The main objective of the chapter is to examine how and in what ways the domestic rule of law institutions and the contexts of donor and organization development policies differ from each other, and how this gap is translated into rule of law promotion approaches abroad. This question is examined within the realm of externally assisted rule of law reform using the Central Asian region as a case study. To answer this question, this chapter compares rule of law promotion strategies of the EU, the OSCE, Russia, and China by breaking down development policies according to contextual understanding, goals, organization, promotion approaches, and objectives. Based on these comparative analyses, the chapter examines how the EU and the OSCE position themselves in the midst of a fierce struggle between the major regional powers in the still near and yet so distant Central Asia.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'International Security Studies', 'Terrorism and Political Violence', 'Political Science', 'Development Studies', 'Comparative Politics']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-13249-0_42,en,Strategies for Encoding Multi-dimensional Grading of Architectural Knitted Membranes,OriginalPaper,"This paper introduces the knit as a special case of functionally graded materials. The ability to specify knitted material both structurally and materially allows for multi-dimensional grading of the knit. This ability to functionally grade knit is defining for knitted material’s relevance to architecture and construction, as it allows for combining performance multiple criteria in one material by smoothly transitioning between the properties in a single manufacturing act. However, the scaling of knit to architectural scale brings computational challenges for automating material specifications. This paper investigates the methods for solving these computational challenges when operating with multi-dimensional material gradings that increase the scale and resolution of knitted textiles and therefore increase the complexity of their encoding. The method for multi-dimensional material grading of CNC-knitted membranes is developed through the project of Zoirotia, a large-scale textile installation (Fig.  1 ). Zoirotia is made of 88 unique membranes, where each is uniquely graded at the levels of both material structure and yarn composition. This results in surfaces of varied expansion properties and color transitions across the entire structure, achieved by changing yarn morphology and material. The project is understood as a testing ground for solving the challenge of large volume material graded specification through simplified numerical data and the process of binarisation. A dithering technique is used to translate rich design-driven gradients for material specification into binary gradients for CNC fabrication. This paper presents the gradient numerical map as a solution for handling the material specification spanning across the multi-element structures.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Industrial Design', 'Interaction Design', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction']"

The MBAC with different weight percentage (10–50wt%) are mixing with resin and hardener and laminated on the concrete prototype pile using PVC mold. The investigation on the barnacle growth on MBAC piles were monitored and water absorption was assessed as a function of mixing ratios according to the ASTM D570-98 standard. The barnacles were monitored frequently until 3 months and has been analysed using SCILAB image processing application. Water absorption has been measured after 24 h of immersion in water at 25 °C temperature by using two types of water such as seawater and freshwater. From observation, the results showed that barnacle’s growth is slowed with reduction 64% when MBAC content has been increased from 10 to 50 wt.% into the matrix. Types of seawater shows higher water absorption with increased 18% compared to freshwater as the nature mangrove that absorption when compared with freshwater type.

A finite element (FE) model was established by the high precision FE software ANSYS/LS-DYNA, and the accuracy of the model was verified by comparing with experimental results. Based on the verified FE model, the extended parameters of the model were analyzed, including the effects of concrete strength, slab thickness and slab reinforcement ratio on collapse resistance of RC spatial beam-slab-column substructures and mechanism of load redistribution. The FE analysis results showed that the increase of concrete strength would increase the first peak load of the structure but weaken the deformation capacity of the member. Appropriately increasing the slab thickness can significantly improve the bearing capacity of the structure. And with the increase of the reinforcement ratio at the bottom of the slab, the resistance to catenary mechanism was improved obviously, but the deformation capacity of the structure was weakened. In the whole process of RC frame collapse, the contribution of the slab to resistance was about 46% on average according to load redistribution analysis.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Public Policy', 'Arts']"

The concept of the problem solution is based on a non-experimental method of thermomechanical and stress-strain analysis of the laser welding process of dissimilar materials, which can largely predict suitable welding parameters for real experiments and thus effectively reduce welding defects. All simulation steps were performed using ANSYS simulation software. A Gaussian volumetric heat source was used for the simulation. The physical and mechanical properties of the materials are temperature dependent and must be defined in the simulation software. The ANSYS SpaceClaim module was used to create the geometric model. The geometric model is dimensionally identical to the sample used in the real experiment. The initial conditions in the numerical simulation were determined based on the initial state of the experimental sample. Real samples were welded using a disk laser; parameters were set based on simulation. The results of the thermal analysis are used to examine the temperature fields created in the welding process. They are used to optimize welding parameters. According to experimental and simulation results, there is a different maximum temperature in the weld metal on the copper side as well as on the steel side due to a higher coefficient of thermal conductivity of copper. The results of the stress-strain analysis consist of two parts. The first part examines the effect of clamping on the stresses arising in the welding process, and the second part is focused on the overall deformation. Due to the small differences in the values of the coefficient of thermal expansion of the metals used and the small dimensions of the test specimens, the residual stresses and strains are negligible.","['Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering']"

Understanding the ontological interconnectedness of individual and communal flourishing has important implications for health. A narrow view of health has been framed in biomedical—and frequently physical—terms as the absence of disease or impairment. But broader and more holistic understandings derived from long-standing wisdom in the humanities are increasingly being used in tandem with the allopathic approach, thereby offering a relational understanding of health that transcends a focus on physical infirmity and locates the individual in social, ecological, and spiritual contexts. This wisdom has profound implications for the organization of healthcare, including a restoration of compassion as the heart of healthcare practice, as recent iterations of lifestyle medicine and integrative medicine have demonstrated. A synthesis of interdisciplinary knowledge affirms the goal of building a wellbeing ecosystem that transcends self-centeredness and reimagines health as flourishing.","['Business and Management', 'Organization', 'Industrial and Organizational Psychology', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Philosophy, general', 'Neuropsychology']"

An aberrant angiogenesis is a prerequisite for cancer cells in solid tumors to grow and metastasize. The sprouting of new blood vessels is one of the major characteristics of cancer and represents a gateway for tumor cells to enter both the blood and lymphatic circulation systems. In vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models of angiogenesis have provided essential tools for cancer research and antiangiogenic drug screening. Several in vivo studies have been performed to investigate the various steps of tumor angiogenesis and in vitro experiments contributed to dissecting the molecular bases of this phenomenon. Moreover, coculture of cancer and endothelial cells in 2D and 3D matrices have contributed to improve the recapitulation of the complex process of tumor angiogenesis, including the peculiar conditions of tumor microenvironment.","['Biomedicine', 'Cancer Research']"

Further, the number of embedding bits and the process of watermarking also play a crucial role in deciding the effectiveness of any watermarking process. In this regard, to achieve better security without producing noticeable artifacts in the watermarked image, this paper proposes a dual image-based watermarking technique using an exclusive-or (XOR) operation. The proposed technique utilizes a modified least significant bit (LSB) substitution strategy in the host image (HI) pixel to substitute the watermark bits with a maximum of ±1 modification to each pixel. Each HI pixel embeds two watermark bits by producing two different watermarked pixels each. The proposed technique has better watermark bit embedding capacity, higher perceptual transparency, and security.","['Energy', 'Energy Systems', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks']"

Even though state-of-the-art Eulerian-Lagrangian numerical studies are available in the literature, more studies can still be carried out, either by combining different numerical models or by varying ambient conditions. In this direction, this work was aimed at comparing three turbulent models (SST k-ω, k-ε, and Reynolds Stress), through the simulation of evaporation of a single cough droplet. In order to validate the model, evaporation simulation using (SST) k-ω was compared with a literature result, and the results were similar. Thereafter, two parameters (velocity and particle size) were varied and the results were compared between the aforementioned models. In summary, no significant differences were observed between simulations results obtained at the same conditions, using the respective turbulent models. However, it is believed that such a conclusion was possible because the simulations were carried out at simple conditions (geometrically and parametrically).","['Social Sciences', 'Science and Technology Studies']"

Since then, studies have shown the benefits of the use of ICT in learning processes; however, a large percentage of teachers do not implement the use of digital tools in their subjects, making classes to be developed with orthodox methods such as rote learning or repetition; without achieving meaningful learning. For that reason, some students do not develop adequate critical thinking, a good analysis of information with reflective moments that lead them to build new ideas. In this investigation, a pre-experimental design was used and the type of investigation was explanatory. 39 students of the third cycle of a Peruvian university participated. In the pre-test, 48.7% obtained a regular level in the achievement of their learning, and in the post-test, the results improved significantly, reaching 81.1% in the good level.

The development of an efficient approach to transform biomass wastes into functional carbon-based electrode materials is a hot topic. However, the production process of biologically-based activated carbon needs to be further improved. Here, discarded badminton shuttlecock feathers were used as precursor via activation with potassium ferrate (K 2 FeO 4 ) to prepare hierarchical porous carbon. The obtained carbon material with hierarchical pore structure displays a high specific surface area ( S BET ) of 1279.5 m 2  g −1 , large total pore volume ( V total ) of 0.73 cm 3  g −1 ,and high-level hetero-atom doping (N: 3.78 at.%, O: 7.5 at.%, S: 3.85 at.%). Experimental results reveal that the as-prepared FPCB-750–1:3 exhibits an excellent specific capacitance ( C g ) of up to 449 F g −1 at the current density of 0.1 A g −1 . Moreover, even at 10 A g −1 , the FPCB-750–1:3 electrode still presents a high capacitance of 216 F g −1 . In addition, the energy density (ED) of the FPCB-750–1:3//FPCB-750–1:3 symmetric cell reaches 56 Wh kg −1 at a power density (PD) of 720 W kg −1 in an aqueous electrolyte (1 M Na 2 SO 4 ), meanwhile maintaining a high-class long-term electrochemical stability (fading lower than 4% after 10,000 cycles of charging and discharging). This study provides a trustworthy method to produce promising electrode materials from waste biomass for high-performance supercapacitors.

In particular, we design a discrete time controller and use the Fibonacci optimization algorithm to optimize the controller parameters for the setpoint adjustment strategy so that we can develop two switching control strategies over several time steps. In addition, we also introduce two-stage control in a single time step to expand the transmission control strategy. The proposed control strategies can reduce the frequency adjustment tracking error, according to simulation findings.","['Engineering', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks', 'Control and Systems Theory']"

Despite the fact that there are other remediation approaches available, using microorganisms has several advantages, including cost-effectiveness, few or no by-products, and reusability. Microorganisms are readily available, easily defined, highly diverse, widespread, and can feed on a variety of hazardous substances. They may be utilized both in-situ and off-site, and they can clean up a variety of difficult environmental situations. Amid rising pollution levels, many countries do not impose restrictions on industrialization; nonetheless, suitable remedial techniques can be employed to reduce these issues, particularly when microorganisms give beneficial tools for better alternatives. Soil bioremediation is a time-consuming and expensive method that uses bacteria, fungi, and algae to remediate contaminated places to environmentally sustainable conditions. Microorganisms that break down organic compounds, as well as microorganisms that come into touch with contaminants are used in this process. The contaminated soil provides an ideal environment for bacteria to thrive several methods have been developed to assure that the latter two constraints are overcome and that pollutant biodegradation is improved. Bioremediation’s future development may result in a reduction in energy consumption, as well as a reduction in pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. The importance of microorganisms in bioremediation, their advantages over other processes, and the influence of such microscopic organisms on a clean environment will be discussed in this chapter.","['Life Sciences', 'Microbial Ecology', 'Microbiology', 'Environment, general', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology', 'Sustainable Development']"

The notion of decentralization, enabling ecosystems that provide true ownership of resources without requiring a trusted third party, is gaining interest and is applied in use cases daily. Such use cases vary from simple currency-exchange applications to complex smart contract applications. Designing, building, and deploying blockchain-based applications mostly requires software developers. This introduces a technological burden for organizations who would like to benefit from such systems in their own use case(s) but lack time, financial means, or qualified people. To overcome this burden, we developed a software framework allowing an easy and quick setup of blockchain-based systems for use cases dealing with the exchange of resources. To set up such a system, an easy-to-use user interface is provided that allows business-level people to give the specifications of the system without the need for technical software-, blockchain- or smart contract knowledge. From these specifications an implementation is generated. In this paper, we present the architecture of the framework and discuss the principles used, and the user interface developed for specifying such use cases.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In most of the RRI discourse, ‘stakeholders’ are used as a catchall phrase denoting societal actors without actually pointing to who they are, why their participation is important, what exactly they contribute and why they should be involved in the R & I processes. In the case of citizen engagement, a typical bias emerges around the inclusion of easily accessible groups of publics. In this chapter we look at stakeholder theory as it has been developed and used for strategic business purposes from the mid 80’s and suggest how stakeholder theory may be combined with RRI, RI and QH approaches and applied to research and innovation. We argue that moral, epistemic and power diversity and balance is key to a stakeholder theory of RRI in order to facilitate a democratic debate amongst a wide group of stakeholders in a specific R & I endeavor in order to arrive at outcomes that are appropriate, legitimate, and desirable.","['Philosophy', 'Research Ethics', 'R & D/Technology Policy', 'Innovation/Technology Management']"

One of the possible solutions to this problem is the use of companion robots to improve the life quality of these people. Currently, there are multiple solutions in the state of the art that allow to deal with this problem but the price of these robots is prohibitive. To solve this gap, it is necessary that research and development solutions focus on the development of cheaper robots. In this work, a new open source architecture is proposed to enable the development of low-cost companion robots. The proposed architecture consists of four layers: physical, reactive, deliberative and control. To reduce costs it is necessary to reduce the number of hardware devices and include more open source processing. For each layer we propose a series of basic open source modules needed to implement the common activities of a company robot.

Monitoring and modelling water quality are essential in understanding the behavior of water pollutants and in devising effective mitigation strategies. To achieve and maintain good water quality for a river system, it is important to understand ways of self-purification and governing pollution processes. This study aims to evaluate the self-purification capacity of the Neretva River and identify critical areas with a lack of dissolved oxygen along the river. The MIKE 11 numerical model, developed by the Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI), was applied for the determination of water quality. Simultaneously, HD, AD, and WQ modules were run and modeled. This model was built and calibrated with data from three sampling stations of Neretva River during a period of low flows. Based on the results of calibration and verification of the model in this study, a simulation of the current state of water quality of the Neretva River was performed. The modeling results showed that the water quality of the Neretva River will improve as a result of the construction of a wastewater treatment plant. Since the constructed plant operates with only 40% capacity and large amounts of wastewater are still discharged directly into the Neretva River without prior treatment, the Neretva River self-purifying capacity will greatly help maintain satisfactory water quality in the watercourse.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"
