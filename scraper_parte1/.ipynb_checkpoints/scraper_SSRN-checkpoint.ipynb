Massive related works about signal timing optimization have been proposed and led to many signal control methods and systems. In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have attracted the increasing attention of researchers in the area of signal control optimization, since they can learn the optimal timing policy themselves by analyzing changing patterns between the traffic condition and signal timing plans. Multi-intersection traffic signal control problems face more challenges than classical single intersection problems such as the dimensionality issue as the joint action space of multiple agents grows exponentially with the number of intersections. The existing state-of-art multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms developed for other areas may not suit well with traffic signal control given the complex spatial-temporal nature of traffic flows. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent counterfactual actor-critic with scheduler (MACS) framework for multiple interactions. In this method, decentralized actors control the traffic signals and the centralized critic combines recurrent policies with feed-forward critics. Additionally, a scheduler module that exchanges information among agents helps the individual agent better understand the entire environment. The proposed method was evaluated using simulation experiments based on a real-world urban street network in Shenzhen, China. Results showed that the proposed method outperforms the classic model-based method and several existing RL-based methods according to different measures such as queue length, average delay time, and throughput.

In this paper, we introduce a Reinforcement Learning based approach to develop a trading agent which performs trading actions on the environment and learns according to the rewards in terms of profit or loss it receives.

This is particular the case when considering the uncertainty necessarily associated with the long-term plan of an aircraft fleet. Considering the growing interest in the application of machine learning techniques to operations research problems, this article investigates the applicability of these techniques for airline planning. Specifically, an Advantage Actorâ\\x80\\x93Critic (A2C) reinforcementÂ\\xa0learning algorithm is developed for the airline fleet planning problem. The increased computational efficiencyÂ\\xa0of using an A2C agent allows us to consider real size problems and account for highly-volatile uncertainty in demand and fuel price. The A2C algorithm is found to outperform a deterministic model and a deep Q-network algorithm. The relative performance of the A2C increases as more complexity is added to the problem. Further, the A2C algorithm can compute multi-stage fleet planning solution within few seconds. ']\n",

In this study, we propose a representation method of multi-modal optical networks using high-dimensional matrix diagram. Our study designs an advantage actor critic (A2C) learning framework named deep reinforcement learning based routing and wavelength allocation (DRL-RWA). DRL-RWA learns the correct online routing and wavelength allocation policy by parameterizing the convolutional neural network (CNN) that can sense the state of complex optical networks. We further improve DRL-RWA and propose DRL-RWA with the multi-thread-based training mechanism (DRL-RWA-MT) algorithm using novel A2C and CNNâ\\x80\\x99s training mechanism. DRL-RWA-MT converts dynamic network resources and request routing to graphs by using the representation method of the high-dimensional matrix diagram. These graphs are input to the CNN for parsing the information in the graphs, and CNN's output is transmitted to A2C for learning the correct online RWA policy. The optimization goal of DRL-RWA-MT in each step of the request is to maximize the cumulative reward in the remaining training. Results with multiple topologies show that the multi-modal representation method can improve the learning efficiency, and the proposed ACRA algorithm can optimize the resource allocation. Compared to the baseline (Dijkstra shortest path and First Fit (DSP-FF)), DRL-RWA-MT can optimize resource allocation while effectively reducing blocking probability in the 9-node and NSFNET topologies. \"]\n",

Schulz', 'Governments have always been playing a central role for the provision and protection of critical infrastructures (infrastructures that are essential to national stability and security, such as energy, water or transport). Over the last decade, criticism on the increasing instability and vulnerability of these infrastructures emerged as they require special attention when it comes to modernization and protection, e.g. terrorism. Public-private partnerships open up public monopolies for competition and potential efficiency gains. In this paper, we show the risks and opportunities of including the private sector and consequently business interests on the example of transport infrastructure. We apply a novel institutional economic role model with which we can identify necessary roles (i.e. actions) for the provision and protection of critical transport infrastructure. We, then, provide a theory-driven discussion on the role of public and private actors. The results of our paper give an indication of the role of public policy for transport infrastructure. Taking a broader perspective, this paper will help to understand the effective ratio of public and private actions for the provision and protection of critical infrastructure. ']\n",

In this paper, to minimize carbon trading costs and generation costs, a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method is integrated into the low-carbon economic autonomous energy management system in the EGCES. Different from the previous work, an innovative Transformer-deep deterministic policy gradient (TDDPG) is proposed, combining the Transformer network with superior feature extraction ability with state-of-the-art DDPG with strong decision-making ability. The proposed method in this paper is tailored by the specific energy management problem to meet the requirements of the multi-dimensional and continuous control therein. To validate the advantages of the TDDPG method, comparison analysis with benchmark optimization methods as well as DPG, DQN and particle swarm optimization (PSO) -based stochastic method, is conduct. Simulation results illustrate that TDDPG performs more effectively than the examined DRL approaches in optimizing low-carbon and economy targets, including computation efficiency and optimization results. Besides, TDDPG method achieves by around 9.0% lower average comprehensive costs than DDPG, respectively, and spends lower training time for real-time energy dispatch. ']\n",

Dutton', 'Volker Schneider', 'Thierry Vedel', 'A promising theoretical perspective on the construction of order and change in the evolution of Large Technical Systems (LTS) is an ecological approach in the social sciences, inspired by various branches of biology and environ-mental sciences. In a multitude of variations, ecological approaches apply one or more ecosystem ideas and related concepts to change and adaptation of social and technical systems. Ecologically inspired models put emphasis on: (1) the dynamic interdependencies and interactions between social actors; (2) the multiplicity of relations between the components and outcomes of these systems; and (3) the existence of multiple and relatively autonomous layers and levels in such systems, along with the emergent relations between these levels. In the social sciences, most of these approaches have been developed in the sociology of organizations (population ecology of organizations; organizational ecology). In the political sciences, approaches from this ecological perspective have been applied to understanding the development of local communities, policy sectors, and interest group systems. An under-exploited variant of this perspective is the concept of an ecology of games which emaphsizes the complexity of nested (public and private) decision-making processes in the context of tight social and technical interdependencies and re-lated conflicts. The goal of this paper is to describe the foundations of the ecology of games as a framework for the study of large technical systems in the communications and information technology sector, and explore its explanatory value to a collection of case studies.

This paper argues that the apparent benefits of embedded exchange can arise from an endogenous mechanism: Actors offer better terms of trade and allocate more resources to transactions embedded within existing social relations, thereby contributing to the ostensible advantages of such exchange patterns. In the motion picture industry, not only do distributors show a preference for carrying films involving key personnel with whom they had prior relations, but also they tend to favor these films when making decisions regarding their release (opening dates and the level of promotion). After controlling for the effects of these decisions, films with stronger prior relations to the distributor perform worse at the box office. The results reveal that, rather than benefiting from repeated exchange, distributors produce these effects through their own efforts. ']\n",
      "['The Global Food System and Nodes of Power', 'Mary Hendrickson', 'John Wilkinson', 'William D. Heffernan', 'Robert Gronski', 'Much attention has been paid to the emergence of a globally integrated food system in recent decades, where a few firms dominate in certain agriculture and food sectors, from inputs for food production to where farmers sell their raw agricultural products, to where consumers shop for groceries. Production centered notions of power, dominant in earlier analyzes of the industrialization of the agri-food system, have been challenged in recent years by the emergence of new actors - actors focused on the demand side of the system, led by the transnationalization of retail. Strategies based on food quality and considerations on their conditions of production unleashed a dynamic in which social movements, NGOs, and the politicized consumer began to overshadow the historic actors of agribusiness (examples of which we have discussed above). More recently, however, food inflation is firmly placing an upper limit on quality considerations and supply conditions are restored to center stage as market dynamics swing to the emerging economies.

The proposed method in this paper is tailored by the specific energy management problem to meet the requirements of the multi-dimensional and continuous control therein. To validate the advantages of the TDDPG method, comparison analysis with benchmark optimization methods as well as DPG, DQN and particle swarm optimization (PSO) -based stochastic method, is conduct. Simulation results illustrate that TDDPG performs more effectively than the examined DRL approaches in optimizing low-carbon and economy targets, including computation efficiency and optimization results.

Ecologically inspired models put emphasis on: (1) the dynamic interdependencies and interactions between social actors; (2) the multiplicity of relations between the components and outcomes of these systems; and (3) the existence of multiple and relatively autonomous layers and levels in such systems, along with the emergent relations between these levels.
