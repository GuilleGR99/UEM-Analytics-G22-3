Among\nmany asynchronous RL algorithms, arguably the most popular and effective one is\nthe asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm. Although A3C is\nbecoming the workhorse of RL, its theoretical properties are still not\nwell-understood, including its non-asymptotic analysis and the performance gain\nof parallelism (a.k.a. linear speedup). This paper revisits the A3C algorithm\nand establishes its non-asymptotic convergence guarantees. Under both i.i.d.\nand Markovian sampling, we establish the local convergence guarantee for A3C in\nthe general policy approximation case and the global convergence guarantee in\nsoftmax policy parameterization. Under i.i.d. sampling, A3C obtains sample\ncomplexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2.5}/N)$ per worker to achieve $\\epsilon$\naccuracy, where $N$ is the number of workers. Compared to the best-known sample\ncomplexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2.5})$ for two-timescale AC, A3C achieves\n\\emph{linear speedup}, which justifies the advantage of parallelism and\nasynchrony in AC algorithms theoretically for the first time.

In this paper, we\ndescribe a general model-free RL method for no-regret learning based on\nrepeated reconsideration of past behavior. We propose a model-free RL\nalgorithm, the AdvantageRegret-Matching Actor-Critic (ARMAC): rather than\nsaving past state-action data, ARMAC saves a buffer of past policies, replaying\nthrough them to reconstruct hindsight assessments of past behavior. These\nretrospective value estimates are used to predict conditional advantages which,\ncombined with regret matching, produces a new policy. In particular, ARMAC\nlearns from sampled trajectories in a centralized training setting, without\nrequiring the application of importance sampling commonly used in Monte Carlo\ncounterfactual regret (CFR) minimization; hence, it does not suffer from\nexcessive variance in large environments. In the single-agent setting, ARMAC\nshows an interesting form of exploration by keeping past policies intact. In\nthe multiagent setting, ARMAC in self-play approaches Nash equilibria on some\npartially-observable zero-sum benchmarks. We provide exploitability estimates\nin the significantly larger game of betting-abstracted no-limit Texas Hold'em.\n\n    "

                     "  The optimal policy of a reinforcement learning problem is often discontinuous\nand non-smooth. I.e., for two states with similar representations, their\noptimal policies can be significantly different. In this case, representing the\nentire policy with a function approximator (FA) with shared parameters for all\nstates maybe not desirable, as the generalization ability of parameters sharing\nmakes representing discontinuous, non-smooth policies difficult. A common way\nto solve this problem, known as Mixture-of-Experts, is to represent the policy\nas the weighted sum of multiple components, where different components perform\nwell on different parts of the state space. Following this idea and inspired by\na recent work called advantage-weighted information maximization, we propose to\nlearn for each state weights of these components, so that they entail the\ninformation of the state itself and also the preferred action learned so far\nfor the state. The action preference is characterized via the advantage\nfunction. In this case, the weight of each component would only be large for\ncertain groups of states whose representations are similar and preferred action\nrepresentations are also similar. Therefore each component is easy to be\nrepresented. We call a policy parameterized in this way an Advantage Weighted\nMixture Policy (AWMP) and apply this idea to improve soft-actor-critic (SAC),\none of the most competitive continuous control algorithm. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that SAC with AWMP clearly outperforms SAC in four commonly used\ncontinuous control tasks and achieve stable performance across different random\nseeds.\n\n    "

However, these\nscenarios include dense and dynamic obstacles that make motion planning of\nrobots challenging. Traditional algorithms like A* can plan collision-free\ntrajectories in static environment, but their performance degrades and\ncomputational cost increases steeply in dense and dynamic scenarios.\nOptimal-value reinforcement learning algorithms (RL) can address these problems\nbut suffer slow speed and instability in network convergence. Network of policy\ngradient RL converge fast in Atari games where action is discrete and finite,\nbut few works have been done to address problems where continuous actions and\nlarge action space are required. In this paper, we modify existing advantage\nactor-critic algorithm and suit it to complex motion planning, therefore\noptimal speeds and directions of robot are generated. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our algorithm converges faster and stable than optimal-value\nRL. It achieves higher success rate in motion planning with lesser processing\ntime for robot to reach its goal.\n\n    "

Having demonstrated the potential to significantly improve synchronously parallel learning, the parallel computing based asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) opens a new door for reinforcement learning. Unfortunately, the acceleration's inuence on A3C robustness has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we perform the first robustness assessment of A3C based on parallel computing. By perceiving the policy\u2019s action, we construct a global matrix of action probability deviation and define two novel measures of skewness and sparseness to form an integral robustness measure. Based on such static assessment, we then develop a dynamic robustness assessing algorithm through situational whole-space state sampling of changing episodes. Extensive experiments with different combinations of agent number and learning rate are implemented on an A3C-based pathfinding application, demonstrating that our proposed robustness assessment can effectively measure the robustness of A3C, which can achieve an accuracy of 83.3%."

Therefore, parameter optimization methods such as pointwise scanning, evolutionary algorithms (EAs), and robust conjugate direction search are widely used in beam tuning to compensate for this inconsistency. However, it is difficult for them to deal with a large number of discrete local optima. The A3C algorithm, which has been applied in the automated control field, provides an approach for improving multi-dimensional optimization. The A3C algorithm is introduced and improved for the real-time beam tuning code for accelerators. Experiments in which optimization is achieved by using pointwise scanning, the genetic algorithm (one kind of EAs), and the A3C-algorithm are conducted and compared to optimize the currents of four steering magnets and two solenoids in the low-energy beam transport section (LEBT) of the Xi\u2019an Proton Application Facility. Optimal currents are determined when the highest transmission of a radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) accelerator downstream of the LEBT is achieved. The optimal work points of the tuned accelerator were obtained with currents of 0 A, 0 A, 0 A, and 0.1 A, for the four steering magnets, and 107 A and 96 A for the two solenoids. Furthermore, the highest transmission of the RFQ was 91.2%. Meanwhile, the lower time required for the optimization with the A3C algorithm was successfully verified. Optimization with the A3C algorithm consumed 42% and 78% less time than pointwise scanning with random initialization and pre-trained initialization of weights, respectively."

The actor updates are based on stochastic policy gradients employing Amari\u2019s natural gradient approach, while the critic obtains both the natural policy gradient and additional parameters of a value function simultaneously by linear regression. We show that actor improvements with natural policy gradients are particularly appealing as these are independent of coordinate frame of the chosen policy representation, and can be estimated more efficiently than regular policy gradients. The critic makes use of a special basis function parameterization motivated by the policy-gradient compatible function approximation. We show that several well-known reinforcement learning methods such as the original Actor-Critic and Bradtke\u2019s Linear Quadratic Q-Learning are in fact Natural Actor-Critic algorithms. Empirical evaluations illustrate the effectiveness of our techniques in comparison to previous methods, and also demonstrate their applicability for learning control on an anthropomorphic robot arm."

The proposed FOPID-FOAC scheme exploits the advantages of the FOPID controller and FOAC approaches to improve the performance of nonlinear systems. The proposed FOAC is built by developing a FO-based learning approach for the actor-critic neural network with adaptive learning rates. Moreover, a FO rectified linear unit (RLU) is introduced to enable the AC neural network to define and optimize its own activation function. By the means of the Lyapunov theorem, the convergence and the stability analysis of the proposed algorithm are investigated. The FO operators for the FOAC learning algorithm are obtained using the gray wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is proven by extensive simulations based on the tracking problem of the two degrees of freedom (2-DOF) helicopter system and the stabilization issue of the inverted pendulum (IP) system. Moreover, the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared against optimized FOPID control approaches in different system conditions, namely when the system is subjected to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. The performance comparison is conducted in terms of two types of performance indices, the error performance indices, and the time response performance indices. The first one includes the integral absolute error (IAE), and the integral squared error (ISE), whereas the second type involves the rising time, the maximum overshoot (Max. OS), and the settling time. The simulation results explicitly indicate the high effectiveness of the proposed FOPID-FOAC controller in terms of the two types of performance measurements under different scenarios compared with the other control algorithms."

                     "Signal control has been effective to alleviate urban traffic congestion. Massive related works about signal timing optimization have been proposed and led to many signal control methods and systems. In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have attracted the increasing attention of researchers in the area of signal control optimization, since they can learn the optimal timing policy themselves by analyzing changing patterns between the traffic condition and signal timing plans. Multi-intersection traffic signal control problems face more challenges than classical single intersection problems such as the dimensionality issue as the joint action space of multiple agents grows exponentially with the number of intersections. The existing state-of-art multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms developed for other areas may not suit well with traffic signal control given the complex spatial-temporal nature of traffic flows. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent counterfactual actor-critic with scheduler (MACS) framework for multiple interactions. In this method, decentralized actors control the traffic signals and the centralized critic combines recurrent policies with feed-forward critics. Additionally, a scheduler module that exchanges information among agents helps the individual agent better understand the entire environment. The proposed method was evaluated using simulation experiments based on a real-world urban street network in Shenzhen, China. Results showed that the proposed method outperforms the classic model-based method and several existing RL-based methods according to different measures such as queue length, average delay time, and throughput.

                     "Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has drawn wide attention as a bunch of real-world complex scenes can be abstracted as Multi-Agent Systems. In order to solve the non-local training objective problem in shared reward environments, value-decomposition-based methods have been proposed. Most of them impose priori Individual-Global-Max (IGM) and value-decomposition constraints. Some attempts tune the value-decomposition constraints to achieve a better performance. However, IGM constraint, as the fundamental assumption of value-decomposition methods, is adopted in most value-decomposition methods, which may leads to poor exploration in certain situations. To deal with this problem, a novel algorithm called Mutual-guided Multi-agent Actor-Critic (MugAC) is proposed in this paper. MugAC imposes a joint-action pool, generated by individual action distribution, from which a joint-action is selected by the critic to interact with the environment and as a training objective of the actor. The training paradigm of MugAC provides an off-policy training for actor-critic, which leads to a higher sample efficiency than traditional actor-critic methods in MARL. We evaluate our method against the current state-of-the-art methods in StarCraft micromanagement, which is one of the most challenging and representative tasks. Experimental results show that MugAC outperforms other methods in various scenarios of widely adopted StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC). "

Considering the growing interest in the application of machine learning techniques to operations research problems, this article investigates the applicability of these techniques for airline planning. Specifically, an Advantage Actor\u00e2\u0080\u0093Critic (A2C) reinforcement\u00c2\u00a0learning algorithm is developed for the airline fleet planning problem. The increased computational efficiency\u00c2\u00a0of using an A2C agent allows us to consider real size problems and account for highly-volatile uncertainty in demand and fuel price. The A2C algorithm is found to outperform a deterministic model and a deep Q-network algorithm. The relative performance of the A2C increases as more complexity is added to the problem. Further, the A2C algorithm can compute multi-stage fleet planning solution within few seconds. "

                     "Optical networks have many multi-dimensional properties (e.g., nodes, links, wavelength, bandwidth, etc.), leading to the emerging research topic on multi-modal optical networks. In this study, we propose a representation method of multi-modal optical networks using high-dimensional matrix diagram. Our study designs an advantage actor critic (A2C) learning framework named deep reinforcement learning based routing and wavelength allocation (DRL-RWA). DRL-RWA learns the correct online routing and wavelength allocation policy by parameterizing the convolutional neural network (CNN) that can sense the state of complex optical networks. We further improve DRL-RWA and propose DRL-RWA with the multi-thread-based training mechanism (DRL-RWA-MT) algorithm using novel A2C and CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s training mechanism. DRL-RWA-MT converts dynamic network resources and request routing to graphs by using the representation method of the high-dimensional matrix diagram. These graphs are input to the CNN for parsing the information in the graphs, and CNN's output is transmitted to A2C for learning the correct online RWA policy. The optimization goal of DRL-RWA-MT in each step of the request is to maximize the cumulative reward in the remaining training. Results with multiple topologies show that the multi-modal representation method can improve the learning efficiency, and the proposed ACRA algorithm can optimize the resource allocation. Compared to the baseline (Dijkstra shortest path and First Fit (DSP-FF)), DRL-RWA-MT can optimize resource allocation while effectively reducing blocking probability in the 9-node and NSFNET topologies.

                     "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential in financial tasks. However, existing works optimistically reported profitable results through backtesting, suffering the \\textit{look-ahead bias} and \\textit{overfitting} issues. Therefore, these promising research results do not necessarily lead to a good performance in real-world markets. In this paper, we provide the first empirical demonstration of the stock paper trading task using deep reinforcement learning. First, we employ a ``training-validation-trading\" pipeline where an agent always learns the latest market daily data; meanwhile, the pipeline helps avoid information leakage. Then, we show that the trained DRL agent outperforms a conventional machine learning method (random forest) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index during stock paper trading.

This project seeks to address the Tactical Asset Allocation problem by employing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) Algorithms in a Machine Learning Environment as well as employing Neural Network Autoencoders for selection of portfolio assets. This paper presents the implementation of this proposed methodology applied to 30 stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). In (1), the Introduction to the project objectives is done with the Problem Description presented in (2). Part (3) presents the literature review of similar studies in the subject area. The methodology used for our implementation is presented in (4) whilst (5) and (6) presents the benchmark portfolios and the DRL portfolios development respectively. The evaluation of the performance of the models is presented in (7) and we present our conclusions and the future works in (8). "

Eight health and information technology research databases were searched for papers covering this domain. Articles were assessed by two reviewers, and data were extracted on the article's mental health application, ML technique, data type, and study results. Articles were then synthesised via narrative review.",

Four main application domains emerged in the literature, including: (i) detection and diagnosis; (ii) prognosis, treatment and support; (iii) public health, and; (iv) research and clinical administration. The most common mental health conditions addressed included depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. ML techniques used included support vector machines, decision trees, neural networks, latent Dirichlet allocation, and clustering.",
                     "Overall, the application of ML to mental health has demonstrated a range of benefits across the areas of diagnosis, treatment and support, research, and clinical administration. With the majority of studies identified focusing on the detection and diagnosis of mental health conditions, it is evident that there is significant room for the application of ML to other areas of psychology and mental health. The challenges of using ML techniques are discussed, as well as opportunities to improve and advance the field."
