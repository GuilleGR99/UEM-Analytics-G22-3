In this paper, we present an efficient end-to-end deep learning model for automatically detecting and removing specular highlights in a single image. In particular, an encoder—decoder network is utilized to detect specular highlights, and then a novel Unet-Transformer network performs highlight removal; we append transformer modules instead of feature maps in the Unet architecture. We also introduce a highlight detection module as a mask to guide the removal task. Thus, these two networks can be jointly trained in an effective manner. Thanks to the hierarchical and global properties of the transformer mechanism, our framework is able to establish relationships between continuous self-attention layers, making it possible to directly model the mapping between the diffuse area and the specular highlight area, and reduce indeterminacy within areas containing strong specular highlight reflection. Experiments on public benchmark and real-world images demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both highlight detection and removal tasks.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

In this work, we study a novel and efficient full-duplex strategy network ( FSNet ) to address this issue, by considering a better mutual restraint scheme linking motion and appearance allowing exploitation of cross-modal features from the fusion and decoding stage. Specifically, we introduce a relational cross-attention module (RCAM) to achieve bidirectional message propagation across embedding sub-spaces. To improve the model’s robustness and update inconsistent features from the spatiotemporal embeddings, we adopt a bidirectional purification module after the RCAM. Extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks show that our FSNet is robust to various challenging scenarios (e.g., motion blur and occlusion), and compares well to leading methods both for video object segmentation and video salient object detection. The project is publicly available at https://github.com/GewelsJI/FSNet .","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

A recent large multicenter Italian study demonstrated that the robotic approach to the liver reduces the conversion rate compared to laparoscopy in the setting of high-difficulty procedures, ultimately increasing surgical safety. In this chapter we will briefly review some key points for a better understanding of the robotic approach to the liver and its application in the field of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Robotic liver resection for HCC showed comparable oncological results to the standard open resection, improving short-term outcomes, in particular in cirrhotic patients and those with clinically significant portal hypertension. Moreover, even advanced procedures like associated liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) and donor hepatectomy can be safely performed with the robotic approach. Finally, robotic liver resection for HCC increases the opportunity for patients with reduced liver function to receive a surgical downstaging or bridging before liver transplantation, improving oncological results compared to locoregional therapies.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgery', 'Gastroenterology', 'General Practice / Family Medicine']"

In virtually all robotic applications it is required to somehow define a feasible and safe path, and such a problem can be cast and solved in many ways, given the several possible combination of robots—industrial robots, Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), underwater vehicles—and scenarios—a production line, a warehouse, an hazardous mountain—and therefore a large number of approaches and solutions have been, and are being, investigated. The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of such widespread literature, first by briefly recalling some classic and general-purpose methods used in path planning, then by focusing on some application-specific problems, related to AGVs in industry, medical robotics and robotic welding. This choice is motivated by the prominent relevance of the path planning problem in these three applications. Then, a single application of great industrial interest, such as robotic spray painting, is analysed. Its specific features are described, and several techniques for task modelling and path planning are considered.

Current shortfalls in skilled labor, productivity trends, and ongoing safety challenges point to the need for a drastic shift toward adopting robotics. Addressing these shortfalls would be a necessary component of the shift toward industrializing the construction industry. Despite this lag in technology adoption, the interest and development of robotic technology targeting the construction industry has grown in recent years and is ranging from the use of drones for tracking to advances in offsite fabrication. However, the integration into fundamental site construction necessitates reconsidering the information technology infrastructure needed to support detailed task execution information needs in the change from craft labor to robotic operations. This research presents the identification and mapping of the Information Technology (IT) system architecture required to support building information modeling (BIM) to robotic construction. Combining elements of BIM architecture and information exchanges with the needed construction task decomposition is required.

However, their increasing diffusion has not yet corresponded to the development of shared approaches covering both digital (programming and simulation) and physical (end-effector design, system integration, IO communication) elements of robotic prototyping suited to the unique needs of architectural research. While parallel research streams defined various approaches to robotic programming and simulation, they all either (A) rely on custom combinations of software packages, or (B) are built on top of advanced robotic programming environments requiring a higher skill level in robotics than conventionally available in an architectural context. This paper proposes an alternative open-source toolkit enabling an intuitive approach to the orchestration of various hardware and software components required for robotic fabrication, including robot programming and simulation, end-effector design and actuation, and communication interfaces. The pipeline relies on three components: Robot Components, a plug-in for intuitive robot programming; Funken, a serial protocol toolkit for interactive prototyping with Arduino; and a flexible approach to end-effector design. The paper describes these components and demonstrates their use in a series of case studies, showing how they can be adapted to a variety of project typologies and user skills, while keeping highly complex and specific functionality available as an option, yielding good practices for a more intuitive translation from design to production.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Industrial Design', 'Interaction Design', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction']"

The results of this population survey clearly demonstrate that such application options come across with a high level of acceptance and application potential among the population. Nevertheless, it is expected that the underlying AI in such systems works reliably and that safety for humans is guaranteed. In this chapter, the results of the study are compared with state-of-the-art systems from classical application environments for robots, like the deep-sea and space. Here, systems have to interact with their environment to a large extent on their own over longer periods of time. Although typically the designs are such that humans are able to intervene in specific situations and so external decisions are possible, the requirements for autonomy are also extremely high. From this perspective one can easily derive what kind of requirements are also necessary, and what challenges are still in front of us, when robots should be acting largely autonomous in our everyday life.","['Social Sciences', 'Sociology, general', 'Nursing Ethics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Social Policy', 'Politics of the Welfare State', 'Social Work and Community Development']"

It is triggered due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It originated and spread from Wuhan, China, in December 2019. At present, the entire world is struggling from this virus due to large confirmed positive and death cases of COVID-19. People of every nation have been isolated, and lockdowns are instituted. Despite the introduction of several precautionary measures, the spread of the virus is still increasing at an alarming pace. Although promising development has been made for the development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, no vaccines have been reported to cure the infection. Different antiviral therapies have also been attempted but do not seem to be successful for every patient. To deter the dissemination and control the spread of virus, the frontline healthcare staff and police officers deployed numerous autonomous systems for an increased line of protection. Robots are deployed to conduct different operations including decontamination, package delivery, etc. It also acts as a mediator for two-way communication between the doctors and patients. Recent advancement in robotics for its application in healthcare facilities has been found very effective for the healthcare officials to communicate with the virus affected patients, and this literature has addressed it.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering']"

Furthermore, they have indicated that therapy performance improves if as many sessions as possible are performed. However, the influence of the duration of the session on the performance of the robot-assisted is unknown. This makes it difficult to adapt therapies to patients’ needs. In this preliminary study the influence of session duration has been analyzed. This pilot study has involved four patients separated into two groups with different session durations: 45 min and 30 min. Results show an improvement in upper limb motor function in both groups of patients, improving their exercise performance with a lower assistance level. Differences observed between the two groups of patients are not enough to affirm that there is a difference in the improvement of the motor control of the patients due to the session duration.","['Computer Science', 'Robotics', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Intelligence']"

Use of robots in machining has opened new pathways for the development of flexible, portable robotic cells for several use cases. However, the peculiarity of such cells compared to traditional machine tools calls for novel approaches in their design and dynamic analysis. To this end, this work proposes an approach that integrates the digital twin of the machining process to set the boundary conditions for the design and dynamic analysis of the robotic cell. Physics-based modelling of milling is coupled with a Multi-Body Simulation of the robotic arm to define the inputs for the design of the cell.

In recent years, the techniques and technologies of livestock production have changed significantly. Robotic feeding, milking, harvesting and processing systems are being introduced. High-quality products require impeccable milk quality. Robotics in the process management and control systems are becoming more sophisticated and increasingly affordable. The dairy industry is changing dramatically. An integrated approach to the rational conduct of dairy business allows agricultural enterprises to advance to a more efficient level of production organization (Abeni et al. in J Dairy Sci 88:3542–3552, 2005 ). Robotic milking is widely accepted, especially in Western Europe, as a way to reduce workforce on dairy farms, increase production per cow and improve the lifestyle of dairy farm families milking 40–250 cows (De Koning in Automatic milking–common practice on dairy farms. pp. 52–67, 2010 ). The growing popularity of this technology can be seen in its rapid rate of implementation. In 2009, the estimated number of robotic dairy farms worldwide was 8000 (De Koning in Automatic milking–common practice on dairy farms. pp. 52–67, 2010 ). Only 6 years later (Barkema et al. in J Dairy Sci 98:7426–7445, 2015 ), it was suggested that this number had more than tripled to 25,000 dairy farms worldwide. The percentage of herds milked with this technology is highest in Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands (Barkema et al. in J Dairy Sci 98:7426–7445, 2015 ).","['Engineering', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Agriculture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

In addition to getting acquainted with basic information from STEAM subjects, students can learn to program, develop soft skills, or implement interdisciplinary projects and thus build knowledge in context. Despite the undeniable advantages, the integration of educational robotics into the direct teaching process proves to be challenging. There are several reasons for this. In this article, we want to deal with only one of them, and that is to set the right learning objectives from cognitive domain. During the teaching of educational robotics, we found several inconsistencies. If we created the tasks based on Bloom’s taxonomy and then compared them with the real difficulty of the tasks, the gradation of the cognitive difficulty of the tasks did not correspond to reality. And that regardless of whether he is a beginner or an advanced student of robotics. In this paper, we want to answer the questions we have begun to ask ourselves, namely: How to properly set learning objectives for the use of educational robotic kits in computer science lessons?

VUR may lead to pyelonephritis, reflux nephropathy, hypertension and, ultimately, chronic renal disease. Ureteric re-implantation is indicated when conservative management (prophylactic antibiotics, treatment of lower urinary tract dysfunction and surveillance) and/or endoscopic treatment has failed to prevent febrile urinary tract infections or other complications of VUR. Currently, the vast majority of ureteric re-implantations are undertaken by the open approach using an intravesical (Cohen, Glenn-Anderson, Politano-Leadbetter) or extravesical (Lich-Gregoir) technique. Open surgery, by any of these techniques, leads to successful correction of VUR in >95% of cases with a low complication rate. Minimally invasive techniques to correct VUR are described, with laparoscopy or robotic-assisted laparoscopy utilized to recreate the intravesical (vesicoscopic) and extravesical procedures described in open surgery. Increased complications have been reported following minimally invasive repair and, inevitably, operative time is longer than for open surgery. Vesicoscopic surgery is technically challenging due to problems in creating and maintaining pneumovesicum, and the inherently small working space within the bladder. Consequently, the most favored minimally invasive technique currently is the robotic-assisted laparoscopic extravesical ureteric re-implantation (RALUR-EV) based on the Lich-Gregoir technique. Nerve-sparing techniques have been implemented to reduce the incidence of urinary retention noted following bilateral laparoscopic (including robotic-assisted) extravesical ureteric re-implantation. Following a significant learning curve, recent studies show the results of minimally invasive surgery are approaching those of open techniques.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgery', 'Urology', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Pediatrics', 'Oncology', 'Pediatric Surgery']"

A test case scenario consisting of a robotic cell with 4 pick-and-place manipulators has been set to validate the method. Starting from a pre-scheduled trajectory, robots are moved at the highest speed and acceleration and, by performing the sequenced operations, the optimal trajectories are defined. The goal is to find a trajectory that minimizes the time cycle and the total energy consumption, while avoiding collisions between the robots’ links: comparing the results thereof to those of the pre-scheduled trajectory, noticeable energy saving has been obtained along with possible decrease of the cycle time.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Computer-Aided Engineering (CAD, CAE) and Design']"

This trend is visible in the changing age structure of the population as the proportion of older people is growing while the proportion of working-age people is reducing. The demographic changes in the EU result in the decreasing percentage of working-age people and the increasing relative number of pensioners. The coming decades will see a significant rise in older adult numbers in the total population. The increasing life expectancy and ageing are putting a strain on the economy while also demanding to improve society’s well-being, meet the needs of older people and make use of their potential and abilities. Older adults require support in the form of care, especially in the case of a low independence level. One technology that can significantly improve the quality of life of older people is humanoid robot (for example the Rudy Robot). This paper aims to analyse and evaluate this technology in terms of different groups of criteria: competitiveness, demand, technical, social and ethical, ecological, and ease of use. These criteria were initially identified and then examined to see which of them the respondents thought were the most important. According to the respondents the most important criteria are demand and technical aspects. Therefore, the article analyses the Rudy Robot in more detail in terms of these two groups of criteria. It was also checked whether age, gender of the respondent, place of residence and education had an impact on the assessment the Rudy Robot.

A plethora of automated or semi-automated inspection systems have been engineered to enable the robotic manipulation of specific types of sensors. Robotic inspection systems are usually operated through off-line programmed tool-paths. This approach works well when an accurate model of the part is available and the robotic inspection takes place in a well-structured environment, where the part position is precisely registered with respect to the robot reference system. However, it makes the inspection setup for each new part very time-consuming and dependent on the skills and experience of the robot programmer. Moreover, the real geometry of a part may significantly deviate from its digital counterpart, resulting in inaccurate tool paths. This work introduces a new approach capable of conferring full autonomy to robotic sensing applications, providing a breakthrough in the state-of-the-art. As a result of this work, fully autonomous single-pass geometric and volumetric inspection of complex parts, using one single robotized sensor, becomes possible.

The shortage of materials influences also timber construction, which has been experiencing a revival in the last decades, due to the material’s excellent reputation as a sustainable resource. The rising motivation to build more sustainably demands large material quantities that the market can hardly supply. Hence, strategies to increase the efficiency of material usage are needed. Conventionally, material efficiency is equated exclusively with the reduction of the total amount of material used. However, a more holistic approach that considers not only the total quantities but also the dimensions and material grading could offer novel strategies to improve material usage and reduce waste. A fundamental shift in the design and construction of timber building elements is required with a particular focus on strategies enabling the reuse and recycling of small-scale timber components and on joining methods that enable the elimination of adhesives and thus allow for disassembly. This research, therefore, proposes a novel system of hollow timber slabs comprised of multiple layers consisting of an internal layer of small-scale beams in optimized locations connected to two outer plates through wood dowels. To design and fabricate these pure timber slabs the application of computational design and optimization methods to identify ideal material layouts and the use of automated robotic assembly processes to simplify production are required.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Industrial Design', 'Interaction Design', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction']"

The robotic swimming velocity response due to the active IPMC tail fin deflection under applied electric potential has been observed. Considering the Laplace transform of the mathematical model, the transfer function relating the tail tip deflection and input voltage has been generated and proportional, integral and derivative (PID) closed-loop controller has been developed to control the deflection from IPMC in an underwater environment.

In the latest years, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) technology was introduced to overcome these issues. RPA was used in the Banking sector in Bahrain with a strong recommendation to use it especially in the Operation activities of the banks. RPA is used to automate the repeated tasks and studies on these technologies found it RPA systems will lead to reduce the cost of these activities, minimize the time take to finish these activities, reduce mistakes done by individuals and enhance the productivity of the organisation. All these advantages can be applied to the Banks and these operation’s activities.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-21065-5_8,en,Control and Stability of an Aerial Manipulator Depending on the Inertial Parameters,OriginalPaper,"Control and stabilization of aerial manipulators is a challenging problem due to the effects of the relative movements of the arm and aerial platform on the dynamics. In many cases, conventional multirotor controllers and autopilots are based on the cascaded structure of underactuated mechanical systems, and consider these effects as perturbations. This control scheme, which controls the arm and the aerial platform as two separated systems, is known as decoupled control scheme. In practice, the success of this approach will depend on the design and movements of the arm. This paper presents the analysis of the control performance and stability of an aerial manipulator with a decoupled controller for different speeds of movement and inertia moments of the manipulator arm. The aerial manipulator consists of a hexarotor and a 2-DoF manipulator arm with variable length links. The arm was built in this way to change its inertia, so it may be representative of a widely class of arms used in aerial manipulation. The proposed aerial manipulator has been analysed in simulation tests for two representative tasks. For both cases, the stability limits of the system, represented as stability maps , are identified as a function of the inertial design and the typical velocities of the arm movements. These stability maps are validated through experiments. This analysis will be useful to guide the inertial design of the arm and to define the envelope of arm movements for safe operation.","['Engineering', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Robotics']"

Introducing MRS to construction requires a radical change to the current practices in the AEC industry as there currently exists little to no precedents for small, agile machines working on construction sites. Beyond the physical hardware, sensing communication and coordination strategies necessary to deploy MRS, the methods for designing structures assembled by MRS must be considered as they can influence what is possible with the novelties inherent to construction with such systems. In order to approach the question of design, this paper aims to break away from current standards of top-down design methods by introducing two agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) approaches for designing structures to be assembled with MRS that consider geometric and fabrication constraints in the process of design. Each approach is outlined at a conceptual level, further explained using an existing MRS at the operational level, and then analyzed based on its general workflow, interactivity, and adaptability. By providing the various approaches, we aim to understand how, not only the MRS themselves but, the method for designing structures with such systems can help to achieve the goal of inexpensive, adaptive, and sustainable construction promised by the application of MRS in the AEC industry.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Industrial Design', 'Interaction Design', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-14125-6_59,en,Device and Technique of Automated Assembly Equipment Productivity Improvement,OriginalPaper,"The work is aimed at the increase of automated assembly equipment productivity by means of adaptation facilities for connected parts. Adaptation in automated assembly is the correction of relative position and angular orientation of connected parts in order to eliminate their axes misalignment before mating. The need for adaptation facilities is caused by the lack of parts positioning accuracy in assembly equipment. The productivity of current automated assembly devices is significantly reduced at the increase of the initial misalignment between connected parts. The method described in this article, as well as the adaptation facility allow eliminating the mentioned disadvantage. The time of assembly operation fulfillment is reduced due to the following operations: a) simultaneous execution of stages of search, transfer and adaptation of a connected part; b) maintaining of constant speed of part movement at misalignment reduction; c) the shortest movement trajectory of adaptation facility. The device consists of two guide flat elements, located at an angle. The device is also equipped with electrical contact sensors in order to obtain a signal of interaction with a part. The adaptation facility is installed on the assembly robot actuating element, performing reciprocating movement. For a detailed study of the adaptation facility and its internal processes, a pilot installation was developed on the basis of a training robotic complex. The functionality of the proposed adaptation facility has been experimentally confirmed. It has been stated that an increase of adaptation facility movement speed has a significant effect on the productivity growth.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Mechatronics']"

In fusion 360, the load cases validated above, preserve geometries, obstacle geometries, constraints, materials and manufacturing methods are defined by the user based on the calculation and literature survey. Multiple designs are generated by the software’s algorithm based on the user defined inputs mentioned above. The various generative design outcomes are studies based on comparing various factors such as material, mass, maximum Von Mises stress, maximum displacement and factor of safety. The best generative design outcome is selected by considering the above factors with weight reduction and structural rigidity as primary goal.","['Materials Science', 'Structural Materials', 'Nanotechnology', 'Materials Science, general']"

The purpose of this study is to systematize scholarly input on smart automation to date and to elucidate their primary contributions to the performance management difficulties. We found 45 publications on artificial intelligence, robotics as well as other technologically advanced within PM settings in the international business (IB) and general management (GM) and information management (IM) journals. The results demonstrate that smart automation technologies provide a new strategy to managing personnel and improving company performance, providing various performance management opportunities and also major technological and ethical problems. Its influence is based on performance management techniques such as job substitution, work collaboration between human robots and AI, policy-making and apprenticeship possibilities, and performance management activities, namely recruitment, education, and job performance.

An increasing number of older adults live alone, which promotes loneliness and depression risks. Also, the digital divide exacerbates these issues and other social difficulties, since older adults are not able to use technology to communicate. A socially assistive robot could help to address these loneliness and digital divide problems. However, it is critical to incorporate affectiveness and naturalness to promote the user acceptance of the robot. This project makes use of the existing EVA open-source robotics platform. The aim is to improve the quality of life of older adults by boosting their independence and alleviating loneliness or other emotional issues that can arise. To improve the user acceptance and to get a more natural, affective, non-passive behavior, this paper contributes to integrate several aspects to the EVA robot: a) assistiveness through conversations and a social messaging end-user skill to reduce the digital divide; b) proactivity by means of proactive interventions so EVA is able to start conversations; c) affectivity by means of showing emotions with eyes expressions, user recognition and emotion analysis in user input; and d) naturalness by blending all these characteristics with a low response time in the interaction and the novel wakeface activation method. Finally, a technical evaluation of the proposed solution provides evidence of its appropriate performance.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In this context literature has highlighted the benefit of coupling gait analysis and musculoskeletal modeling for treatment planning. Recently, this combined approach has been successfully applied to detect the alterations in motor control related to Parkinson’s Disease (PD). However, no study has reported about the effects of an overground wearable exoskeleton in terms of both gait analysis and musculoskeletal modeling-derived parameters in people with PD. The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess the effect of an overground rehabilitation treatment on a PD participant both in terms of gait parameters and muscle forces. One people with PD has been enrolled and gait analysis was performed before and after a 4-weeks gait training intervention with an overground exoskeleton. Inverse kinematics, inverse dynamics, and static optimization were performed in OpenSim. Results from joint moments and muscle forces were compared with a group of healthy controls. Preliminary results showed that after the therapy joint loads in both ankle and knee joints were reduced during the stance phase and muscle forces displayed an increased magnitude in their peak after the treatment. For the best of our knowledge, the presented case study is the first attempt to track rehabilitation improvement via muscle forces assessment. Further studies should focus on increasing the sample size to generalize the outcomes.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Machine Learning', 'Bioinformatics']"

The cable terminals are created by injection moulding which has the inherent requirement of leaving extra material (sprues) to allow the correct mould filling and to compensate for the dimensional changes during the cooling process. Sprues should be removed in a controlled way and disposed for recycling. However, features within the moulds may lead to larger sprues, porosity in the terminals, and a brittle interface between the terminal and the sprue. The latter causes early sprue separation, causing other issues in the production line. This work addresses the sprue size and its consequences from an industrial case study. In this case, the process was studied following a systematic approach to establishing the most effective solution. Subsequently, the mould and mould structure were improved, allowing for a controlled sprue size and a common mould structure for 95% of the products of the company, which reduced the tooling preparation time. Then, adjacent components were addressed to facilitate the product flow. The improvements were minimal invasive, keeping compatibility with the componentry of other production lines. The modification led to a reduction of 62.6% in the sprue mass, porosity was reduced by 10.2 and 55.9%, corresponding to two terminal models. In conclusion, the interventions done fulfilled the requirements and improved the operation of the line.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Engineering Design']"

Recently, the authors demonstrated the feasibility of improving HRC by using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to establish hands-free, nonverbal communication. Despite the potential of EEG to provide reliable means of communication, there is a concern regarding the quality of the collection of EEG signals, especially low spatial resolution. EEG signals collected from wearable devices suffer from this problem because the number of electrodes (5–32) is much lower than traditional clinical EEG systems (64–256). More importantly, the low spatial resolution may reduce the reliability of human–robot communication driven by EEG signals. To address this challenge, this study seeks to increase the spatial resolution of EEG signals by proposing a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based data augmentation framework. In it, artificial EEG signals will be produced from actual signals. To examine the feasibility of increasing the spatial resolution of EEG signals for an improved HRC, the EEG dataset of four subjects was collected using a wearable 32-channel device. The results show that the framework can enhance the spatial resolution of the collected dataset by 39.1% by generating realistic artificial signals. It also increased the accuracy of the EEG-based robotic teleoperation by 4.9%. It is expected that increasing the spatial resolution of EEG signals will improve the reliability of EEG-based human–robot communication.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

They have greater power to weight ratio and as human muscles, work in an agonistic-antagonistic way, where compressed air will provide the necessary traction force. PAMs are also called short-stroke machines. Since human muscles work in agonistic-antagonistic pairs, pneumatic muscle-type actuators will play an important role in the development of an assistive rehabilitation robotics system. They can generate a great deal of force across a short distance. PAMs can contract by up to 30% with a minimal load. Due to these advantages, they are widely used for several applications.

As close human-to-human contact can spread the COVID-19 causing virus, keeping social distance is now an absolute necessity as a preventative measure. At a time of global pandemic, there is a huge need to treat patients with little patient–doctor interaction by using robots. Robots can be characterized as machines that can execute a wide range of tasks with greater autonomy and degree of freedom (DoF) than humans, making it difficult to identify them from other machines. A wide range of equipment, sensors, and information and communication technology (ICT) are now part of the healthcare system, which has become increasingly complicated. Protecting front-line personnel from virus exposure is the primary goal of using robots in health care. The aim of this study is to emphasize the evolving importance of robotics applications in health care and related fields. This paper examines in depth the design and operation of a wide range of healthcare robots in use around the world.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

When a new robot arrives at a company, it should be running at full capacity in a short time. However, many companies lack staff with the necessary training and skills to do so, and new employees require a quick and efficient learning process. However, it is not easy to adapt training courses to today’s changing flexible production processes. Self-directed training can be a useful alternative in these situations, as long as it is carried out with well-prepared teaching materials, organized content and self-assessing tasks. Therefore, in this work, an interactive guide for Robotics self-learning is proposed and evaluated. This training action helps ensure that training procedures can be adjusted and synchronized with the demands of the rapidly evolving manufacturing processes. This interactive and autonomous learning makes easier entering the labor force.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Education, general']"

For example, the boring of tunnels can affect infrastructures located on the surface. Therefore, devices are required for the monitoring of every building in the area of interest. Topographic surveying is one of the most popular techniques for the monitoring of buildings and civil infrastructures. Standard optical prisms are targeted with high frequencies by Robotic Total Stations (RTS). In order to estimate 3D displacements of each prism, static control points are needed. These points must be located outside the area of interest. However, it is not always possible in dense urban areas. In this study, the use of GNSS receivers as control points for topographic surveying is proposed. In this case, control points do not need to be static because their global positions are known. The methodology is explained and the required additional processing steps are outlined. The approach is implemented for the monitoring of a conveyor belt in the Grand Paris Express (GPE) project in Paris, France. Feedback is provided on implementation, data collection and processing. Finally, performance of the system is analyzed and compared to traditional monitoring techniques.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The elements are based on the SL Block system developed by Shen-Guan Shih. The work proposes strategies to assemble multiple SL blocks to form larger aggregations which subsequently turn into building elements on another scale. This approach allows reconsidering the resolution of architectural constructions. Building elements that have previously been considered as solid and monolithic can now be aggregated by many small SL-Blocks. Those dry-joint aggregations allow for easy disassembly and reassembly into different configurations and therefore contribute to a circular reuse of building elements. In order to facilitate such a permanent transformation, the research also includes first steps towards the autonomous assembly of building blocks through a robot including the planning for how to optimally place the parts, as well as ensuring feasible execution by the robot. The goal is a fully autonomous pipeline that takes as input a user-defined, desired shape, and the available building blocks, and directly maps to actions that are executable by the robot. As a result, the desired shape should be optimally resembled through the robot’s autonomous actions. The research therefore addresses handling the combinatorial search space regarding the possibilities to combine the available parts, incorporate the constraints of the robot, creating a feasible plan that ensures the stability of the structure at any point in the construction process, avoiding collisions between the robot and the structure, and in the case of SL-Blocks, trying to ensure that the overall structure is interlocking.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Statistics, general']"

In particular, the assembly of flexible cables and wire-harnesses in vehicles is still performed manually as there is yet to be a reliable and general solution for this problem. This paper presents a simple yet efficient motion planning algorithm to mount a flexible wire in an assembly jig, where the wire must traverse a set of forks in order. The algorithm uses a heuristic based on a set of control points to guide the wire’s movement. Various controlled assembly scenarios are built in simulation using MuJoCo, a physics engine that can emulate the dynamics of Deformable Linear Objects (DLO). Experimental results in simulation demonstrated that the amount and orientation of the forks has a large impact in the solution’s performance and highlighted several key ideas and challenges moving forward.

To achieve high resistance and low weight, mainly synthetic materials are used such as carbon or glass fibers, bonded with petrochemical matrices. For the construction industry, these additive processes present a very promising and resource-efficient building technology, yet they are still hardly used with sustainable materials such as natural fibers or timber. The 3DWoodWind research prototype has developed a new generation of additive technologies to wood construction. The modular building system is built with a three-dimensional robotic winding process for material-efficient hollow lightweight components. An AI-controlled design logic enables the intelligent combination and design of modular components into multi-story structures, which may be used in the future to substitute solid wood panels and beams as well as concrete slabs and steel sections. Our current research uses a continuous strip of thin timber veneer, which is a waste product from the plywood industry and therefore, presents a highly sustainable alternative to synthetic fibers usually used in winding, as well as solid timber products known in construction. The veneer’s natural fibers are intact and continuous, and offer high tensile strength. In the presented project, three-dimensional winding processes were developed for material-efficient lightweight components made of wood. The demonstrator presents a modular column and ceiling system, which aims at large scale applications in multi-level structures. Having won an open national design competition for Germany’s ‘ZukunftBau’ Pavilion, a first demonstrator is currently being built to be presented in May 2022, as part of the DigitalBau exhibition. The paper discusses all planning engineering and production processes in detail with particular emphasis on the machine-learning algorithm, which was trained during the design process to facilitate design iterations and future planning with this component-based building system.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Industrial Design', 'Interaction Design', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction']"

When offloading parts of a robot’s processing to the cloud, system performance and safety become highly dependent on the capacity of network and cloud technologies to fulfill a given set of requirements. This is further complicated when the robot must interact with a person, and HRI may be compromised by poor QoS. Although research in the field of cloud-enabled and human-in-the-loop CPS has gained traction in the last years, there is still a need for systematically setting the requirements posed by the interplay of these factors. This results in a lack of understanding of how infrastructure-related QoS issues inherent to cloud robotics affect user-perceived QoE during HRI. In this chapter, we use the eHealth field to highlight the importance of understanding a system’s requirements during cloud integration. By the end of the chapter, we present a case study considering cloud-enabled robots used for assisting human locomotion. This kind of system relies on close physical HRI and imposes multiple challenges on the adoption of cloud robotics. We finalize by discussing the impacts of overall QoS in the perceived QoE when a user interacts with a robot.","['Engineering', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Robotics', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT']"

In this work, an image classification algorithm is developed to complement a pervasive therapy support system for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) during the development of their homework. For this purpose, a camera is adapted within a smart environment made up of Smart objects and a robotic assistant. In the system, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is implemented for the classification of the child’s status (doing or not doing his/her homework). An experiment of this implementation is carried out in which the results of the environment without the camera are compared with the results obtained by using the camera and the implemented CNN. The latter results are also compared with the information collected through observation by the therapist during the session. The results show that what the camera identifies as the child not doing homework matches what the smart objects identify as distractions and pauses at 82.70% and what the therapist identifies as distractions and pauses at 98.21%.

Firstly, the rhythm of swimming of an elongated undulating fin-like black Knife fish is generated by Central Pattern Generator (CPG). In the CPG network, the Hopf oscillators are employed to provide the rhythmical output and ensure continuous sinusoidal oscillation even when the CPG parameters are abruptly changed. The smooth transition output of the CPG is dependent on an intrinsic parameter of the oscillator called the convergence speed. This parameter is optimized by a combination of Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Policy Gradient (PG), which overcomes the drawback of traditional DQN, such as providing stable learnings to adapt specifically to dynamic environments. The simulation results demonstrate that the convergence speed of the modified CPG network based on DDPG is improved by about 2.2%. It also indicates that the rhythmical output of the CPG integrated with the DDPG optimizer can provide higher accuracy of oscillatory amplitude (about 1,6%) than do the traditional DQN, leading to high efficiency in controlling the swimming gait of the robotic fish.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Electrical Engineering']"

The primary constituents of bio-based materials or ‘Biomaterials’ are the materials derived from living matter, which are naturally present in our environment or can be synthesized chemically. A material can be qualified to be called a biomaterial if obtained via extensive processing, as a regular leather, wood, paper, etc., although these are bio-derived, should be avoided to be termed as a biomaterial. Bulk chemicals, platform chemicals, solvents, polymers, and bio-composites are some of the typical materials that are derived from biomass. These biomass-derived materials account for ~14% of the global bulk material production, while synthetic materials, predominantly produced from fossil-based feedstock, only account for a share of ~7%. Researchers are currently developing a technology to make biomaterials sustainable and to have a more substantial positive impact on the environment.

While researchers are struggling for genome sequencing and understanding the changes occurring in virus sequences, on the other hand, common people are struggling to control their fear about the future in all aspects. After the successful research for vaccination, the medical experts analyzed the post-COVID-19 impacts on various health fronts like heart failures, thrombosis, impact on brain, and many more complications. Out of which, identification of post-COVID-19 impact on brain took more time to understand the exact way the virus is affecting because psychological behavior is the first symptom and that takes keen observation to suggest the possibility of neurological infections. But, by that time, the illness reaches to more serious complications. Also, post-vaccination evidence shows that the blood clot formations becoming a new challenge for brain tumor patients. The blood clots in nervous systems are so tiny that by MRI/CT, it is not possible to differentiate between cerebral fluids. Hence, it becomes necessary to operate patient immediately with a clear vision facility for blood clots. Hence, this paper suggests the new deep learning algorithm which can be a great solution for image analysis with high level of accuracy. The proposed deep CNN module further can be used as a software package for needle camera for robotic assisted surgery which in turn saves time for image analysis and direct location of tumor can be identified during live camera surgery.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']"

However, the development of visual perception systems for forestry robotics needs to be researched and explored to achieve safe solutions. This paper presents two main contributions: an annotated dataset and a benchmark between edge-computing hardware and deep learning models. The dataset is composed by nearly 5,400 annotated images. This dataset enabled to train nine object detectors: four SSD MobileNets, one EfficientDet, three YOLO-based detectors and YOLOR. These detectors were deployed and tested on three edge-computing hardware (TPU, CPU and GPU), and evaluated in terms of detection precision and inference time. The results showed that YOLOR was the best trunk detector achieving nearly 90% F1 score and an inference average time of 13.7 ms on GPU.

A manipulator having the ability to alter its stiffness characteristics provides an advantage to make it suitable for versatile applications. Recently, cable-driven serial chain manipulators, CDSMs, have emerged as an important robotic architecture for various applications due to their promising features, such as low moving inertia, large payload handling capacity, and flexibility in altering its system architecture. Owing to the unidirectional force application property of cables, these systems are redundantly actuated. The flexibility in architecture modulation within a CDSM implies the possibility of varying system performance. Accordingly, system parameters of CDSM can be altered to modulate the stiffness behavior of the manipulator. In this work, we attempt to modify the stiffness characteristics of CDSMs through the addition of passive springs.

However, for robots to operate in a dynamic environment, a system for determining the gripping position for objects in the scene is also required. For this purpose, neural networks segmenting the point cloud are usually applied. However, training such networks is very complex and their results are unsatisfactory. Therefore, we propose an innovative and end-to-end approach to generating the grip position that replaces (3D) point cloud segmentation with 2D image segmentation. For this purpose, we create an OrthoView module that acts as an adapter between 3D space (point cloud) and 2D space (image). The 2D object mask created in it serves as basic information in the process of selecting the final grip from among the grips generated for the entire scene using Contact GraspNet. An unquestionable conceptual advantage of our solution (OrthoView) is the fact that only one resulting 2D image is created from the point cloud, which can be the result of merging (integrating) 3D images from many cameras. Therefore, it allows for the fusion of information from any number of cameras, without the need to implement solutions for identifying the same objects seen from different perspectives (cameras). In order to test our solution stream, we created 6 scenes of different complexity, on the basis of which we present the effectiveness of our solution. Thus, eliminating the need for 3D point cloud segmentation and reducing the image segmentation problem to infer from only one 2D photo can significantly improve the performance of the position estimation system for grasping objects.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Computational Intelligence']"

Reasons, for example, are the lack of programming and automation solutions with which simple tasks can be easily and in no time teached onto a robotic application. One of the fastest possibilities of online-teaching robots without programming is hand-guiding. Provided mainly for human robot collaboration most of the suitable cobots have a restricted payload. This leads to a very limited field of application regarding machining or the handling of heavy weight tools. In contrast high-load industrial robots are very common for large-series machining, but the necessary knowledge and programming effort currently prevent the use for quickly changing tasks. This paper presents an approach, which reduces the time for online teaching of industrial robot machining. An equipped hand guidance and additional force sensors enable the user to perform the machining operation by handling the workpiece or tool as usual and records the resulting process paths and forces for teaching. Combined with a simple graphical interface for the necessary user-input the solution is empowered to repeat the recorded machining operation according to the current setup autonomously.

In fact, it is essential that robots are equipped with advanced touch sensing in order to be aware of their surroundings and give a feedback to an operator. Such sensing systems are made of sensors and an elaboration unit that acquires tactile signals and process the data, retrieving information such as texture, hardness, and shape. In this paper, we propose a novel tactile sensing system made of flexible, high sensitive and high spatial resolution piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride‐trifluoroethylene P(VDF-TrFE) sensors, and a low power and low cost Interface Electronics (IE) that can acquire data from 32 channels simultaneously with a sampling frequency of 2KSamples/s. We validate the system acquiring data from three different objects to classify their hardness using an artificial neural network of one hidden layer with approximately 89% accuracy. The signal processing and the classifier will be hosted by the IE in the next future.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Materials Science, general', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics']"

The type-2 fuzzy system is applied to improve the efficiency and robustness of the traditional PID controller, allowing for improving the classical regulator, by introducing a certain degree of intelligence in the control strategy. For the purpose of verifying the effectiveness of the approach developed in this study, all the simulation results attest that the (T2FL-PID) compared with (T1FL-PID) and (PID) controller produces a better response.

However, before assembling, pegs and sleeves need to be adjusted. In practice, if there is a significant misalignment of the position of the shaft and sleeve, seizure or deformation may occur during the assembly process.

These applications can range from dispensing medication to providing more personalized services to caretakers. However, this kind of robotization is associated with severe ethical and societal implications. To advance the design and acceptability of socially interactive robots it is, therefore, necessary to consider and analyze those concerns. The RoPHa research project aims at supporting care-dependent people to lead more independent life. This chapter examines potential ethical challenges and impacts in elderly care that were discussed during the design of the robotic system in the project. For evaluating the effect of assistive robotics on elderly care in practice, the MEESTAR model was applied. The ethical implications of the proposed applications were mapped to seven moral dimensions, such as autonomy, justice, privacy, etc. Each dimension were examined from three different perspectives (individual, organizational, and societal). All identified ethical implications were graded based on the degree of ethical justifiability. The results include ethically relevant questions regarding the role of the robotic system, its technical implications, economic and distrust barriers, occupational safety, data security as well as the legal and safety responsibilities of all involved parties.","['Social Sciences', 'Sociology, general', 'Nursing Ethics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Social Policy', 'Politics of the Welfare State', 'Social Work and Community Development']"

A robot platform is winched up a wind turbine tower to reach a blade locked into a 90° pitch angle. The blade region to be inspected is reached by a combination of an extension ladder and a 5-axis robot arm to place an end-effector onto the blade surface. The end-effector is critical to the success of the shearography technique used to detect subsurface defects when the blade is experiencing inevitable out-of-plane, in-plane, and root-to-tip vibrations. The paper describes the development of the end-effector which carries the shearography unit and ensures (with passive compliance and design based on analysis of aerodynamic blade shapes) that the unit remains at a constant distance from blade surface in the presence of blade vibrations. The system has been tested with three separate field trials in a wind farm near Athens in Greece.

In medical/surgical domain, integration of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and robotic manipulators has given significant benefits to both, surgeons as well as to patients. In literature, notable contributions have been reported by various researchers for the design and development of MIS robots. For the transmission design of these manipulators, cables are the key elements. Being unilateral elements, they work in tension only. Therefore, for their efficient operation, pre-tension is the prerequisite. To achieve the same, different ways have been introduced in past. However, in the current work, it is noticed that design of such manipulators needs to be refined further. In this direction, current work introduces a novel tension adjustment mechanism for cable-driven robotic manipulator and presents its kinematic and force analyses. Further, various kinematic parameters and forces characterizing the proposed concept are plotted in the MATLAB environment. From these plots, it is learnt that derived formulation is in good agreement with physical behavior of the devised mechanism. To demonstrate the introduced concept, it is proposed to implement the same to a double-parallelogram-based RCM mechanism. Typically, this mechanism is used for MIS applications. For the realization of the embodiment, development of a prototype is in progress. Moreover, the proposed mechanism has potential to provide precise and accurate cable tension with mere standard manufacturing tolerances and assembly methods.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics']"

Also, because most welding robot applications are taught and played, they must be reconfigured each time they engage in a new duty. This takes time, and welding settings must be improvised for each new weld job. Hence, this study addresses these concerns by proposing an alternate way of automatically recognizing weld joint types. This paper suggests an effective way to classify the weld joint type using the feature extraction technique. This research aims to create a fusion model that uses sophisticated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to recognize Welding joints from a dataset. The suggested hybrid model incorporates the essential characteristics of both; the CNN and the SVM classifier.

The model is trained and tested using the Kaggle Weld joint dataset (for Butt and Tee Joint) and an in-house dataset (for Vee and lap weld joint). The collection comprises a variety of weld joint photos captured from various perspectives. CNN’s receptive field aids in the automated extraction of the most distinguishing aspects of these images. The experimental findings show that the suggested framework is successful, with a recognition accuracy of 99.7% over the mentioned dataset.

Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is a metal additive manufacturing technology that is gaining popularity in the aerospace and automotive industries due to its use in the maintenance and repair of key high-cost goods. As a result, in today’s manufacturing industry, surface roughness modeling and prediction of printed components are crucial. The purpose of this research is to develop an optimal neuro-fuzzy system that can represent surface roughness in the WAAM process using a set of input process variables such as welding speed, wire feed speed, and overlap ratio. During hybrid learning of the first-order Sugeno fuzzy system, three distinct membership functions, such as trapezoidal, bell, and Gaussian-shaped, were used to examine the accuracy in prediction of surface roughness by three membership functions. The experimental data were compared to the anticipated surface roughness values produced from the proposed adaptive neuro-fuzzy expert system. According to the results of the comparison research, the suggested technique may provide an ideal database and rule foundation for predicting deposition characteristics in the metal additive manufacturing process.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Materials Engineering']"

In this chapter, we explore interactional data from synchronous hybrid university-level foreign language classrooms in which one student participates via a telepresence robot, a remote-controlled videoconferencing tool. In contrast to many other forms of video-mediated interaction, the user of a telepresence robot can move the robot and thereby (re-)orient to the space, the other participants and material objects that might be outside his immediate video screen. We employ an ethnomethodological and conversation analytic (EMCA) perspective to explore Barad’s (Quantum physics and the entanglement of matter and meaning.

We demonstrate the complex nature of telepresent agency by investigating where agential cuts lie in three short episodes that involve mediated perception, touch and movement.

Over the years, researchers have drawn inspiration from Nature to devise many single-robot approaches. Swarm approaches have been growing in popularity, as they offer redundancy to the loss of agents, flexibility, scalability and enable experimenters to employ simpler robots. Many existing swarm approaches make use of robot formations. In this work, we focus on optimising the shape of a swarm formation for finding and tracking odour plumes. We do so by using a genetic algorithm, thus avoiding the cumbersome trial-and-error process that experimenters typically follow to hand-design the formations. The swarm is guided by a leader, which is controlled by a bio-inspired search strategy using the perceptions of the entire swarm. The results show that the evolved formations of three and five robots consistently outperform a single robot and that the best evolved three robot formation is more successful than the hand-designed swarms of three and five robots. As a result, one could opt by using the evolved three robot formation, minimizing the amount of robots needed. Conversely, in case there is a high risk of loss of robots, the evolved five robot formation could be preferable.","['Computer Science', 'Robotics', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Intelligence']"

The RestArt system comprises a high-accuracy 3D laser scanning of two fragments positioned on a special machine specifically designed for handling and accurately move large fragments. Then a software-simulated best-fitting of the two homologous fractured faces of each fragment provides the needed roto-translation matrix, which drives the machine control system to move one fragment to match the other one. Also, the RestArt machine integrates a numeric-controlled moving drilling device for high-precision boring of the fractured surfaces at the designated points for optimal coaxial rods insertion. This permits a very effective fixing of the fragments and allows multi-point fixing, which is practically impossible with conventional methods. The efficacy of the RestArt reassembly method was experimented through shaking table tests on 80-cm-height stone columns specimens. Some specimens were restored by the traditional method, taken as benchmark. All specimens were subjected to strong vibration tests reproducing extreme earthquakes and truck transport on pot-holed road.

In this scenario, a Graphic User Interface (GUI) has been realized to ease the implementation of the presented algorithm, offering a fast and user-friendly tool to be used by robotic cell designers. Different manipulators models can be uploaded in the GUI to then automatically run the non-linear optimization process and retrieve a minimum-energy trajectory. As an instance, a 6 Degrees of Freedom IM has been considered; the obtained results have been compared with other methods known from the literature and validated through a commercial tool. The proposed method is verified to be more effective for energy-intensive trajectories, possibly reaching EC savings of more than $$10 \%$$ 10 % .","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Computer-Aided Engineering (CAD, CAE) and Design']"

The current study compared the safety and feasibility between subxiphoid-approach thoracoscopic thymectomy (SATT) and lateral intercostal-approach thoracoscopic thymectomy (LATT) for Masaoka-Koga stages 1 and 2 thymoma. Methods The study retrospectively enrolled 461 patients without myasthenia gravis who underwent SATT or LATT at the Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University between 2016 and 2020. A 1:1 propensity score-matching (PSM) analysis was performed to control for selection bias. A series of perioperative outcomes, including surgical outcomes, inflammatory factors, morbidity and mortality, pain assessment, and quality of life, were compared. Results Each group consisted of 144 patients after PSM. The results showed that the SATT group had a significantly higher rate of exposure to the bilateral phrenic nerves (SATT [98.6 %] vs. LATT [77.1 %]; p < 0.001) as well as a larger maximum length (9.20 ± 3.08 vs. 7.52 ± 3.44 cm; p < 0.001) and width (6.13 ± 1.81 vs. 5.04 ± 1.77 cm; p < 0.001) of resected tissue than the LATT group. In addition, the SATT group had lower postoperative high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels (9.37 ± 2.17 vs. 12.69 ± 2.13 mg/L; p < 0.001), better postoperative days 1, 3, and 7 visual analog pain scale (VAS) scores ( p < 0.001), and better postoperative days 30 and 90 quality of life ( p < 0.05). However, the two groups showed no significant increase in surgical time, estimated blood loss, total drainage time, postoperative total drainage volume, complications, or postoperative hospital stays. Conclusions The study results suggest that the SATT is feasible and safe for Masaoka-Koga stages 1 and 2 thymoma.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery']"

GAS and SOL load the Achilles tendon to store elastic energy during stance followed by a rapid energy release during APO. We use a neuromuscular simulation (NMS) and a bipedal robot to investigate the role of GAS and SOL on the APO. We optimize the simulation for a robust gait and then sequentially replace the MTUs of (1) GAS, (2) SOL and (3) GAS and SOL by linear springs. To validate the simulation, we implement NMS-3 on a bipedal robot. Simulation and robot walk steady for all trials showing an impulsive APO.

Then, to better deal with external time-varying disturbances, minimize the chatter from the controller and implement the synchronization control goal of multi-ARV systems, a robust synchronization controller for multi-ARV systems is developed, which combines high-order sliding mode control (HOSMC) and CCSC.

Current directions for balance rehabilitation require the inclusion of virtual reality (VR) tools as a complementary robotic tool to conventional physical therapies to accelerate balance recovery. This works aims to present the design and validation on healthy of a wearable and fully immersive VR-based tool following a user-centred design. This wearable VR tool comprises four Activities of Daily Living-based virtual challenges including nine motor tasks, chosen according to those most performed in the literature, as well as in the tasks of the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Timed Up and Go (TUG) clinical tests. This system comprises wearable VR technology, providing multimodal feedback (visual, sonorous, and vibrotactile cues), and integrates wearable inertial sensors for real-time motor assessment.

Many terrain recognition approaches use tactile sensory feedback to classify and map flat or irregular terrains. However, less attention has been given to the use of tactile sensing in the detection of round-shaped complex terrain such as industrial pipes with varying diameters. In this paper, we provide a solution to this problem by developing a rigid-soft electromagnetic robot foot for an inchworm-inspired pipe crawling robot, incorporating four appropriately positioned tactile sensors in the elastomeric part of the robot feet. By describing the sensor positioning criteria and soft toe fabrication method in detail, the new tactile sensing robot feet are tested on different industrial pipes and a flat surface. The recorded tactile sensory feedback is analyzed using an average value method. Based on the analysis, a confusion matrix is provided, where the success of the proposed tactile sensing addition in the soft toe is shown by classifying four different industrial pipe diameters and a flat plate. The results reveal the usefulness of tactile sensing and the way it is introduced into the robot feet to facilitate complex locomotion tasks with adaptability.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The impact of industrial development on education development will also be seen. The rapid development of science and technology has had a great impact on human life. Digital technologies are the basis for achieving financial effects and innovation in the industry [ 1 ]. Today's education has a role to play in meeting the needs of the industrial revolution.

The claw of the FWFR grasps the branch with enough friction to hold the system steady in a stationary condition. Before the take-off, the claw opens itself and the friction between the claw and branch vanishes. At that moment, the mechanical model turns into an under-actuated multi-link (serial configuration) robotic system where the first joint can rotate freely without any friction as opposed to rotation. The stabilization and balancing are the crucial tasks before take-off. This work explores a new methodology to control an under-actuated lightweight manipulator for its future adaptation to FWFR to improve the stabilization performance before take-off. The setup tries to mimic the birds with two-link legs, a body link, and 2-DoF (degrees of freedom) arms, being all active links except the first passive one. In contrast to common arms, the lightweight-design restriction limits the frame size and requires micromotors. With all of these constraints, control design is a challenge, hence, the system is categorized: a) the leg subsystem (under-actuated), including the two first links, and b) the body and arm subsystem (fully actuated) with the rest of links. The fully-actuated links are controlled by feedback linearization and the under-actuated part with active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) for estimation and rejection of the coupling between both subsystems. The mechanical design, modeling, and control of the proposed system are reported in this work. Experimental results have been also proposed to present a proof of concept for this modeling and control approach.","['Computer Science', 'Robotics', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Intelligence']"

It involves public transportation management, infrastructure control, and road safety. Its main purpose is to avoid risks and accidents, reduce traffic congestion, and ensure safety for road users. Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are core components of ITS where wireless communications between vehicles, as well as between vehicles and infrastructure, are possible to allow exchanging road, traffic, or infotainment information. VANETs are vulnerable to several security attacks that may compromise the driver’s safety. Using misbehavior detection approaches and information analysis demonstrated promising results in securing VANETs. In this context, machine learning (ML) techniques proved their efficiency in detecting attacks and misbehavior, especially zero-day attacks. The goal of this chapter is two-fold.

The feats of human creativity and innovation provide our conspecifics too much to marvel at and feel proud of what human civilization has achieved in the course of its evolution down the ages. However, despite all our technological sophistications, we have failed to achieve this glory without compromising the ecological balance of nature. The ecological fallout of anthropogenic activities makes us ponder over the drawbacks inherent in man-made technologies. From this perspective, insects emerge as serious competitors to man because their intriguing evolutionary history is a unique success story which saw their domination in all habitats and resulted in their unprecedented diversity without disturbing the environment and its delicate balance. This is such a remarkable thing that tempts us to learn a lot from insects and come up with novel, environment-friendly, and more efficient technologies. Many branches of life sciences such as genetics, molecular biology, developmental biology, and chronobiology have benefitted so much from the studies on insects that insect models have become indispensable for their growth. Interestingly, insects have been an inspiration behind many of the technological advancements of our contemporary world. The fields of aviation and architecture owe a lot to insects for some of the bizarre designs and out-of-box ideas. Over the past few decades, there has been a significant rise in the application of insects for achieving technological breakthroughs. Materials science is coming forward as a major beneficiary of insect-derived substances with interesting properties which find application in various industries and are appearing in a large variety of useful products. Further, the movement patterns of insects are leading to innovations in robotics and prosthesis. The present review takes a closer look at the uses of insects in the growth of science and technology. It gives a bird-eye-view of the major developments in insect-inspired breakthroughs in basic sciences and their applications in technology and is expected to grab the attention of entomologists and technocrats alike. Given the rapid pace at which this subject is growing today, it is quite likely that it will soon find a prominent place in mainstream entomology syllabi.","['Life Sciences', 'Zoology']"

The autonomous SnakeBot is highly fitted for confined surroundings as they can enter and travel through these places with a higher degree of freedom because of their small cross section and highly redundant kinematics. The first focus of SnakeBot is to copy the movement of the similar named reptile-the serpent. The discussed design of SnakeBot consists of a head-followed seven segments which together comprises the body of the robot. The 28015 PING RevC ultrasonic sensor is attached to a central unit consisting of Arduino, in the head segment which controls the SnakeBot. The sensor then determines whether or not there is a barrier in front of the robot and, if so, measures its distance. Analyzing this distance with the directions already coded in the central unit, the snake robot decides the direction to continue the movement. This design can prove beneficial in many real-life problems and can be further improvised by coupling with other technologies.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Materials Engineering']"

In Sect.  6.2 , the goals and research question posed in this book are extrapolated towards the goal of interaction, disturbance and fault-aware flying robot swarms. It is argued that robust operation of interacting flying robots requires systematic handling of interactions and external inputs from individual robot to swarm level. For this, a scalable methodology for interaction, disturbance and fault handling is introduced, resulting in an awareness pipeline scheme that can be applied to robot swarms. Another algorithmic key element for unification is the extension of well established methods from operational space and multipriority robot control to this system class, potentially leading to novel controls and skills of flying robot swarms.","['Engineering', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Robotics']"

These systems can provide accurate solutions to bin picking in cluttered environments, where the scenario is always changing. This article proposes a robust and accurate system for segmenting bin picking objects, employing an easy configuration procedure to adjust the framework according to a specific object. The framework is implemented in Robot Operating System (ROS) and is divided into a detection and segmentation system. The detection system employs Mask R-CNN instance neural network to identify several objects from two dimensions (2D) grayscale images. The segmentation system relies on the point cloud library (PCL), manipulating 3D point cloud data according to the detection results to select particular points of the original point cloud, generating a partial point cloud result. Furthermore, to complete the bin picking system a pose estimation approach based on matching algorithms is employed, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP). The system was evaluated for two types of objects, knee tube, and triangular wall support, in cluttered environments. It displayed an average precision of 79% for both models, an average recall of 92%, and an average IOU of 89%. As exhibited throughout the article, this system demonstrates high accuracy in cluttered environments with several occlusions for different types of objects.","['Computer Science', 'Robotics', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Intelligence']"

The objective is to steer all the evaders towards a desired tracking reference while avoiding escapes. The problem is very challenging due to the highly complex repulsive evaders’ dynamics and the underdetermined states to control. We propose a solution that is based on Implicit Control and a novel dynamic assignment strategy to select the evaders to be directly controlled. The former is a general technique that explicitly computes control inputs even in highly complex input-nonaffine dynamics. The latter is built upon a convex-hull dynamic clustering inspired by the Voronoi tessellation problem. The combination of both allows to choose the best evaders to directly control, while the others are indirectly controlled by exploiting the repulsive interactions among them.

Currently, mainly skilled workers can correctly perform this operation, divided into the successive steps of grinding and polishing, leading to long production times, poor reproducibility of results, and exposure to human error. For this reason, the industry is trying to move towards automation involving, for example, high-precision machine tools and machining centers. However, these solutions require high investment costs and long setup times. Using robotic cells helps to reduce these expenses, manufacture larger components, and increase the flexibility in the production chain. In this research, we present an unconventional approach to the robot-assisted grinding of optical samples made of borosilicate crown glass. The samples were guided by a six-degree-of-freedom industrial robot on a rotating grinding disc while imposing to them different trajectories with complex geometry. We avoided regular grinding patterns, which are easily recognizable by human eyes and affect the quality assessment, by superposing multiple relative movements between the machined surface and the abrasive grains. The ground surfaces of the samples were characterized based on average roughness values, profile error data, and surface topography images. Finally, we selected the best robotic grinding procedure matching the trajectory and strategy with optimal surface quality, processing time, and productivity.

Common gantry- and robotic arm-based systems impose scalability limitations based on the printer size. Several research efforts proposed using multiple mobile 3D printers towards large-scale printing, relying however on unrealistic assumptions of continuous communication among all agents. Here, we explore an active sensing framework allowing individual agents to assess other agents’ progress without directly communicating with them. Our approach leverages environmental modifications introduced by each agent during printing to track the structure evolution. We focus on heat conduction in the structure, which we discretize as a 2D lattice embodying its topology. Using on-board sensors, agents measure temperature and heat at their location, which they use to infer structure’s topology. From the input-output time-series and prior knowledge of the printing task, an agent identifies the system state-matrix by using a subspace identification method and solving an inverse eigenvalue problem. We demonstrate the validity of our approach through numerical simulations, establishing conditions for successful inference.

To tackle these issues effectively, an integral fast terminal sliding variable is employed in place of linear sliding variable that ensures the tracking error finite-time convergence during sliding mode. To deal the chattering issues, a third-order super-twisting control law is used as a robust term that makes the control continuous. The Lyapunov theory has been utilized for investigating the stability in finite time of an entirely closed-loop system. Finally, the performance and efficacy of the proposed approach are examined by conducting numerous numerical simulations under CPS and without the CPS framework.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Big Data', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks']"

When the objects are prone to entanglement, having an estimation of their pose and shape is highly valuable for more reliable grasp and motion planning. This paper focuses on modeling entangled tubes with varying degrees of curvature. An unconventional machine learning technique, Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), is used to construct sets of rules (theories) capable of modeling multiple tubes when given the cylinders that constitute them. Datasets of entangled tubes are created via simulation in Gazebo. Experiments using Aleph and SWI-Prolog illustrate how ILP can build explainable theories with a high performance, using a relatively small dataset and low amount of time for training. Therefore, this work serves as a proof-of-concept that ILP is a valuable method to acquire knowledge and validate heuristics for pose and shape estimation in complex bin picking scenarios.","['Computer Science', 'Robotics', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Intelligence']"

As the human population keeps on rising, the demand for food also increases and so is the dependency on the agriculture industry. But in today’s scenario because of low yield, less rainfall, etc., a dearth of manpower is created in this agricultural sector and people are moving to live in the cities, and villages are becoming more and more urbanized. On the other hand, the field of robotics has seen tremendous development in the past few years. The concepts like Deep Learning (DL), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) are being incorporated with robotics to create autonomous systems for various sectors like automotive, agriculture, assembly line management, etc. Deploying such autonomous systems in the agricultural sector helps in many aspects like reducing manpower, better yield, and nutritional quality of crops. So, in this paper, the system design of an autonomous agricultural robot that primarily focuses on weed detection is described. A modified deep learning model for the purpose of weed detection is also proposed. The primary objective of this robot is the detection of weed on a real-time basis without any human involvement but it can also be extended to design robots in various other applications involved in farming like weed removal, plowing, harvesting, etc. in turn making farming industry more efficient.

However, the practical deployment of a distributed multi-camera multi-target tracking system poses other important challenges. In this work, we address two of these practical problems. The first one is the spatial and temporal identification of the targets in the network, i.e., the data association problem. To solve it, we propose to build intelligent and adaptive local appearance models of each target that only store the most relevant information. The second problem is the intensive use of bandwidth caused by the periodic communications that each camera requires for the cooperative tracking and the data association of all the targets. In the paper, we manage the bandwidth usage with an event-triggered mechanism that controls how much information is sent. The main novelty of our mechanism is to account for the scene density, coupling it with the data association module and enhancing it. We integrate the new modules into an existing distributed multi-person multi-camera tracking system and demonstrate their benefits on different public benchmarks of increasing difficulty.","['Engineering', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Robotics']"

Of late, there has been debate on the empowerment of differently-abled people through entrepreneurship and self-employment. Society has now started believing that entrepreneurship is the only option that would help develop confidence and strengthen the economic status of differently-abled people. This paper highlights that entrepreneurship is a choice for differently-abled people to be self-reliant rather than a compulsive choice. Technology plays a significant role by supporting differently-abled people and making them more abled in performing various activities. The diffusion of technology through Industry 4.0 has provided independence to these people through much-advanced technology. This accelerates the motivation and self-esteem of differently-abled people. Further, it contribute towards making an improved version of an entrepreneur in them. However, government interference is crucial to build a better ecosystem for all the differently-abled, especially those who want to be economically empowered.

The carboxysome lumen is enriched with Rubisco and carbonic anhydrase (CA). The polyhedral proteinaceous shell allows the passage of HCO 3 − ions into the carboxysome, where they are converted to CO 2 by CA. Thus, the carboxysome functions as a CO 2 -concentrating mechanism (CCM), enhancing the efficiency of Rubisco in CO 2 fixation. In β-cyanobacteria, carboxysome biogenesis first involves the aggregation of Rubisco by CcmM, a scaffolding protein that exists in two isoforms. Both isoforms contain a minimum of three Rubisco small subunit-like (SSUL) domains, connected by flexible linkers. Multivalent interaction between these linked SSUL domains with Rubisco results in phase separation and condensate formation. Here, we use Rubisco and the short isoform of CcmM (M35) of the β-cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 to describe the methods used for in vitro analysis of the mechanism of condensate formation driven by the SSUL domains.

The consequence is that the aircraft is re-assembled at least twice and therefore this process has been proved highly inefficient. This paper describes the framework developed under the “Integrated Smart Assembly Factory” (ISAF) project in the “Intelligent Factory” specialisation area in Italy. Taking advantage of the emerging tools brought by Industry 4.0 the ISAF framework spearheads innovation in the assembly process of aircraft skin panels by integrating smart and digital technologies such as in-line measurement systems with highly accurate sensors, large-scale physics-based simulations, multi-disciplinary process optimisation and additive manufacturing.

Results from different experiments are reviewed showing that the auditory and somatosensory channels together can produce constructive effects resulting in measurable perceptual enhancement.

However, given the dynamic and unstructured nature of construction sites, robots’ engagement in complex tasks requires high intelligence and autonomy levels. While working with highly-automated robots in shared workspaces can result in higher productivity and lower costs, it may not be embraced by many construction workers, resulting in poor performance, safety, and well-being. Therefore, it is critical to profoundly understand workers’ response to imminent autonomous robots before their vast implementation at construction sites. In this context, effective measurement of workers’ cognitive load provides insights into human responses to robotic co-workers. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of autonomy levels of construction robots on workers’ cognitive load using qualitative and quantitative methods. To that end, an experiment was conducted in which subjects performed a masonry task in two different scenarios in collaboration with a semi-autonomous and an autonomous robot. An immersive virtual environment was used as a controlled and safe testbed to examine workers’ cognitive load while working alongside a virtual construction robot. Subjects’ electroencephalography (EEG) signals and questionnaires (NASA-TLX) were collected to assess cognitive load during each scenario. The results indicated that subjects’ cognitive load increased with an increase in the robot autonomy level, suggesting incorporating human factors in designing collaborative robots. The findings can help to determine adequate autonomy levels for seamless human–robot collaboration at construction sites.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

Education is the main engine of the prosperity and development of civilizations. In addition, to being the center of measurement of growth and development of societies, all peoples care about it and seek to develop it. Given the difficult conditions that the world is going through due to the epidemic of Covid-19, the educational sector has a renewed interest in a humanoid social robot, to limit contact with the public and avoid overcrowding in schools and keep pace with education despite the pandemic. This paper aims to propose an interactive tutoring environment, using an assisting humanoid robot to support the teaching and learning process in the classroom. Statistics indicate that the use of educational robots has seen a notable evolution recently, more than 85.70% of teachers have been using robots in the classroom for less than 5 years. The teaching humanoid robot assistant can catch student’s attention, then help teachers improve the way they present their courses and manage their classes. In this work, we represent the main activities that a teacher does to invade the classroom to have a good session with his students. All these activities represent knowledge level tasks for the teacher, while for our humanoid robot assistant, we have defined its tasks that represent primitive level tasks, and we have chained these tasks to give a generic knowledge model that allows defining a knowledge level task for the teacher from a composition of primitives tasks of the assistant humanoid robot in the teaching act.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

We focus on two approaches with a linked example. One approach is to analyze human cognitive abilities to isolate functions that have particular use in some processing domains (like language), with potential re-use in other domains. Here we focus on symmetry perception and production as may be realized in the function, expect a copy or a specialization of that function, expect a complemented copy . We illustrate the benefits of assuming such an operator is available to language processing by demonstrating that it allows reconciling empirical facts of human language processing with the natural predictions of formal language theory. The other approach is in simulation systems, parameterized to afford exploration of the effects of assuming that posited operators behave in particular ways. We link this to the expect a copy function through this being fundamental to habituation, which is requisite in simulation systems that model evolving behaviours and social constructs, like natural language.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The number of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomies (LSGs) performed globally has increased markedly and has become “trendy” among bariatric surgeons in the last few years [1]. LSG has attained its position as the primary procedure of choice in bariatric surgery for morbid obesity. In this procedure, 80% of the stomach, mainly the body and fundus are removed longitudinally, leaving behind a sleeve of the stomach along the lesser curve [2, 3]. The procedure can be performed by minimally invasive approaches as well as single incision access or even robotic surgery with comparable results [4, 5]. The weight loss is achieved by restricting the food entering the stomach. Another factor in the effectiveness of weight loss in sleeve gastrectomy is the decrease in blood levels of ghrelin, “the hormone that stimulates hunger,” and a majority of cells responsible for producing this hormone is found in the fundus which is removed during this procedure. This procedure can be performed as the first stage in more complex bariatric cases including cases of super-obesity before procedures like Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or the duodenal switch can be performed [6]. The objective is to achieve an initial weight loss that would help to perform more extensive mixed restrictive or malabsorptive procedures safely and effectively [7–9].","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Minimally Invasive Surgery', 'Colorectal Surgery', 'Imaging / Radiology', 'Surgery']"

Experience teaches us that actuators for haptic applications can rarely be found “off-the-shelf”. Their requirements always include some outstanding features in rotational frequency, power-density, working point, or geometry. These specialities make it necessary and helpful for users to be aware of the capabilities and possibilities for modifying existing actuators.

However, due to the involvement of certain levels of manual measurements, there still exists potential for improvements in the quantification of damage caused in a structure. Therefore, in this study, key-point point detection using fiducial markers is used to reduce the error in quantification of overall displacement and deformed profile of structural components (e.g., beams). This study demonstrates the use of a fiducial marker-based approach to quantify the deformation and bending profile in beam elements without physically disturbing the specimen. The visual fiducial marker (e.g., AprilTag) system has been extensively used in robotics for purposes ranging from localization of robots to increasing precision while tagging different objects in the robot’s surroundings. These AprilTag are attached to the surface of the specimen before loading. In this research, while the load is applied on the beam, the behavior of the specimen is then recorded by using a high-resolution digital camera during the experiment. Camera calibration using a checkerboard is performed to determine the extrinsic parameters (e.g., camera pose). With the help of attached AptilTags on the surface of the specimen, pixel values at the four corners and the center of each of the tags are detected during the experiment. These pixel locations are then used to get the corresponding world coordinate system by minimizing the loss function. Unlike normal bundle adjustment algorithms, camera parameters are treated as known parameters during the optimization process. Primary results show potential of proposed method in obtaining robust measurements.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

Thereby, this support structure usage is a critical issue that needs to be controlled for minimizing the printing time and post-processing challenges associated with AM parts. To alleviate the errors due to the support structures, these faceted models can be deposited in multi-direction using multi-axis systems. This paper presents an approach to decompose the design features and detect multiple build directions for certain cases of faceted models to print parts using multi-robots collaborative material extrusion (MRCME) systems developed by the authors. The use of support structures limits the surface finish of as-built 3D printed parts. The objective of this work is to develop a volume decomposition algorithm, which can decompose the part into sub-volumes and identify the build direction of the decomposed sub-volumes. The build direction is found from the geometric reasoning of the concave and convex loop centroids. Initial decomposition is done with the concave–convex loop pair relationship, and further regrouping is done with the bounding box of the identified pair of concave and convex loops in that particular build direction. The work presented in this paper would help process planning systems to automatically determine Multi-Directional Sub-Volumes (MDSV) and carry out effective part deposition with minimum or no support structures.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Machinery and Machine Elements']"

During winter, expert pruners are employed to remove certain primary branches of dormant trees based on a set of predefined rules. The end goal of the automatic pruning applications is to reduce dependence on this huge labor and associated humongous costs by automating the pruning decisions, which in turn would facilitate easy interface with intelligent robotic pruners. In this chapter, we have developed a robust 3D reconstruction scheme that utilizes color information in addition to the time-of-flight depth data from Kinect2 sensor for accurately modeling the trunk and primary branches of a dormant apple tree. The motivation behind incorporating color in our framework is to acquire accurate 3D tree reconstruction even in absence of quality depth data. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons of our proposed approach with a depth based reconstruction technique depicts the usefulness of using color information in our automatic pruning system. On average, the proposed scheme provides a performance of 93.94% accuracy for correctly identifying the branches, and 71.13 and 89.26% for correctly estimating the diameters of the primary branches within error margins of 3 mm and 5 mm respectively.

During operational periods, exposure to ionising radiation make most of the underground infrastructure at CERN inaccessible for long periods, meaning that regular inspection and maintenance is a major challenge. CERN has recently invested significant effort in developing and implementing smart infrastructure and this is being used to overcome these challenges and enhance the way underground assets are managed. Technology at CERN allows the inspection and monitoring of priority infrastructure remotely, enabling regular inspections when access restrictions are in place. A focus on automation, using technology to unlock insights from inspection data, is being implemented so that a move towards a predictive, data-driven asset management system can be made, reducing the cost of repairs, and improving the safety of infrastructure. This paper will give a broad overview of the smart infrastructure concepts currently being developed at CERN. This includes fibre optical strain monitoring, robotics, computer learning fault detection, and digital survey tools using GIS and mobile applications.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

This work describes a robotic hybrid platform that combines mobility with assistance to the user for actuation in its environment. It is conceived for wheelchair users having limited upper limbs actuation. This hybrid platform, a chair-exoskeleton architecture, faces the challenge of providing the required degrees of freedom to achieve an acceptable performance without having a significant implication in weight, size and cost, which increase would limit its real applicability and affordability. Therefore, its design looks for a solution that combines chair performances by providing mobility, posture and manipulation accessibility, with those of an exoskeleton which allow users with some remaining arms mobility to reach and manipulate objects either on the floor, at seating level, or at high level shelters. This paper describes the preliminary design of the wheelchair and the simulation of its operativity to deal with the required user interaction with the environment and points out the need of an intuitive and adapted interface for its control.","['Computer Science', 'Robotics', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Intelligence']"

Therefore, this means that constant assessment of structural integrity is imperative as well the performance of extensive inspection in industrial facilities. Typically, in carrying out these inspections, visual inspection remains one of the primary methodologies applied. However, this is associated with substantial financial implications, as well as safety-related issues. Therefore, this paper focuses on the automated visual inspection (AVI) of defects using computer vision equipped on an inspection robot. The robot holds a mounted camera to provide real time feedback of the inspection plane, which is then analyzed to build up an automated defect classification system based on extracted features of the surface captured, training image set, and the application of statistical inference algorithms.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Materials Engineering']"

The basic idea is to encode tasks into meaningful embeddings and perform the task specified by the given embedding. When the robot is tasked to perform a new, unseen task, it is given a single or just a few demonstrations, from which a new task embedding is obtained by generalizing from existing embeddings. Therefore, task encoding is key to the generalizability of meta-imitation learning. The problem is that most meta-imitation learning methods directly encode the whole task. This will take in too many irrelevant details into the task embeddings, resulting in poor generalization abilities. In this work, we propose to encode a task separately based on its different features, e.g., the required skills and the target objects. As a result, the robot can have a clearer understanding of the tasks and perform new tasks better. We compare the proposed method with typical meta-imitation learning methods on performing a set of robot tasks and test their performances of adapting to new, unseen tasks. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can better encode tasks into meaningful embeddings and thus lead to better generalization.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Related scholars have also proposed many solutions, such as heuristic algorithm, neural network, genetic simulated annealing algorithm, improved genetic algorithm. But there are still deficiencies in welding torch posture, welding position, and robot motion stability. Because of the characteristics of the welding seam have a vital influence on the path planning of the welding robot, it is also the basis for ensuring the welding accuracy. From the perspective of graphic calculation, the graphical computing method of precise welds is analyzed, the point cloud graphics of the welded parts are used to calculate the overlap of primitives, and the accurate and rapid extraction of weld features are realized by changing the graphic representation of the welded parts model. According to the connection characteristics of the weldment, the characteristics of the weldment are collected, and a simple, fast, and more versatile method for extracting and calculating weld features is designed, and the weld features are discretized. Discrete weld feature points are used as the basis for path planning of the welding robot to carry out reasonable welding path planning, which reduces the manual teaching process and workload. Finally, a robot welding path planning method based on graphical computing is proposed, and corresponding simulation experiments are carried out.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

A sliding surface using the information of mismatched disturbance estimates has been developed to ensure the desired system behaviour. Furthermore, a power rate proportional reaching law has been employed to guarantee the finite time reaching of the sliding variable with improved convergence speed. Besides, it also helps in mitigating the chattering phenomena. A novel NDO is proposed for estimating the unknown bounded matched and mismatched external disturbances. The proposed composite observer–controller methodology provides the asymptotic convergence of the tracking error and counteracts the effect of the external disturbances. The closed-loop asymptotic system stability has been proven using Lyapunov stability criteria. The proposed scheme has the ability to provide robustness with a smaller switching gain that results in chattering attenuation further. A simulation study has been done to check the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and simulation results demonstrate the nominal tracking performance with control accuracy.

Following the Bayesian inference framework, this paper investigates the distributed STE problem over a sensor network based on a consensus-based particle filtering scheme. Among different consensus strategies, the posterior-based consensus method is selected, so that all the sensor nodes can reach the same belief of the source term. To effectively approximate the local posterior density functions (PDFs) and share them over the sensor network, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is constructed at each node by resorting to the expectation-maximization method, and the parameters of the GMMs are exchanged between the sensor nodes. The consensus between the GMMs from different nodes is realised in the sense of Kullback-Leibler average (KLA). To provide a numerical solution to this process, an importance sampling method with a novel importance density function is proposed to draw particles at each node with respect to the GMMs from the neighboring nodes. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed distributed STE solution is demonstrated with an experimental dataset.","['Computer Science', 'Robotics', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Intelligence']"

In this way, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) allow images to be obtained with a higher spatial resolution, as they can fly only a few metres above the ground. Therefore, they have become a very useful platform as they have democratised field imaging technology, offering greater versatility in obtaining spectral information due to their small size and significantly reduced costs compared to traditional aerial platforms.

Traditional digital twin approaches are generally applied to single, static systems to enhance a specific process. This paper proposes a framework that applies digital twins and artificial intelligence to manufacturing system reconfiguration, i.e., the layout, process parameters, and operation time of multiple assets, to enable system decision making based on varying demands from the customer or market. A digital twin environment has been developed to simulate the manufacturing process with multiple industrial robots performing various tasks. A data pipeline is built in the digital twin with an API (application programming interface) to enable the integration of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence methods are used to optimise the digital twin environment and improve system decision-making. Finally, a multi-agent program approach shows the communication and negotiation status between different agents to determine the optimal configuration for a manufacturing system to solve varying problems. Compared with previous research, this framework combines distributed intelligence, artificial intelligence for decision making, and production line optimisation that can be widely applied in modern reactive manufacturing applications.","['Engineering', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering', 'Computer-Aided Engineering (CAD, CAE) and Design']"

In this paper, a simultaneous impact algorithm for planar frictionless constrained multibody systems is proposed that does not require an impulse propagation sequence to be determined. The formulation is developed by extending the generalized Newtonian restitution model for simultaneous impacts in unconstrained rigid bodies presented in [ 1 ] to planar linkages connected by frictionless joints. The algorithm is a computationally efficient alternative to the modeling of collisions in force-based continuous-time domains [ 2 , 3 ], never results in an increase in kinetic energy (K.E.) [ 1 ] and predicts contact separation between bodies having zero pre-impact relative velocity of approach. Results using the proposed algorithm showing various collision scenarios in constrained linkages are included in the paper. Furthermore, the solutions are compared with linear complementarity (LCP) [ 4 ]-based approach and simulation results from ADAMS software.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics']"

Questions which they have to answer include who is liable in the case of an accident and how personal data recorded via robots might be used against the owner and for third parties, including government agencies. If robots carry out actions seemingly based on their own decisions the question arises whether robots are legal persons and acquire “personality” rights as a result.

We implement the leader-follower formation type here, where the flock has to navigate in a workspace cluttered with obstacles with respect to its leader to reach its pre-defined targets. In our case, the obstacles will be spherical fixed obstacles and the moving aircrafts in the swarm itself becomes the obstacles for all the other members. This needs to be avoided to successfully achieve the task. The flock navigates the environment in its pre-defined formation and moves towards its target. In the event of an obstacle, the flock splits and rejoins later in a safer location, regaining the desired shape. A set of nonlinear acceleration-based controllers using the Lyapunov-based Control Scheme are designed to achieve this task successfully. The controllers presented will guarantee the UAVs coordinate their motion in a well-planned manner and make sure the aircraft converge to their desired target while avoiding obstacles intersecting their path. The computer-generated simulations of a number of virtual scenarios have been looked at where different predefined formations of the flock have been designed. These simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed nonlinear acceleration control laws, revealing the simplicity and effectiveness of the control technique used.

The developed algorithm provides for some truncation of this distribution, which makes it possible to additionally increase the build step and reduce the number of layers. Thus, conditions are created for rational support and reduced build time. At the same time, a decrease in build time in comparison with the existing strategies of slicing is obtained. The usefulness of the adaptive slicing was evaluated based on a comparative analysis concerning the results obtained in previous studies, subject to the manufacture of individual products. The main compared characteristics are the number of layers and predicted deviations from the correct shape of surfaces concerning 3D models of industrial products. The products are placed in the workspace with different numbers and orientations. An increase in efficiency of the layered process with an increase in density of products placed in the workspace and setting of their rational orientation by minimizing the surface area with predicted most considerable deviations from the correct shape is revealed. The research was carried out using the developed system “Technological preparation of materialization of complex products by additive manufacturing”.","['Engineering', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Engineering Design', 'Materials Engineering']"

This is why, several activities such as handling, assembly, welding, painting, etc… have been attributed to these robots. Thus, to be able to simulate its behavior or to control a robot according to the needs of its operation, it is necessary to go through the first step, which is its modeling. This chapter presents the necessary steps and methods to follow in order to develop the dynamic model of any robot manipulator (open chain, serial). These robots have been constructed to be mechanically rigid, but due to their fast movements, the low flexibility of the articulations may affect their activities. For this reason, the proposed model will consider the flexibility of the joints. Three springs are integrated to model the joint elasticity, as well as the flexibility of the axes between the driven bodies and the output shafts of the gearboxes, and the meshing phenomenon inside the gearbox transmissions. The proposed dynamic model is developed based on Denavit-Hartenberg Modified (DHM) method and using the Euler-Lagrange approach. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to study the effect of the joints flexibilities on the robot behavior.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Materials Engineering', 'Classical and Continuum Physics']"

Such legged walker is modeled by an impulsive hybrid nonlinear dynamics and characterized by a passive dynamic walking. However, despite its simplicity, the passive locomotion of the bipedal compass robot presents so many complex and attractive phenomena. This present work proposes a further analysis of the complex behavior of the compass-gait biped walker while descending various slopes and also by varying the length of the lower leg segment. Our investigation is mainly achieved by means of bifurcation diagrams. We show the appearance of the cascade of period-doubling bifurcations and their route to chaos before the fall of the biped robot.

An ideal exoskeleton model, perfectly aligned with the human joint axes, can be used to co-simulate the human and exoskeleton dynamics. However, human-exoskeleton joint misalignment is commonly observed during the use of an exoskeleton. Using misaligned motion data in the combined human-exoskeleton model can lead to unrealistic results. In this work, we present a new method to align human-exoskeleton models. This was achieved by introducing dummy segments that ensured kinetic alignment between the human and exoskeleton joints without altering the misaligned kinematics. The method was applied on an active lower-limb exoskeleton that assists the elderly in stair negotiation. In a pilot study, motion data of a single subject testing the exoskeleton in stair ascent were recorded using an optical marker-based system. Measured ground reaction force and exoskeleton assistive force were used as inputs in the human-exoskeleton model. The outputs from the model with the dummy segments were compared to those from a model with kinematic constraints and a reference model where the external forces were applied directly to the human model. The results of the knee compression force, knee flexion moment, and activation of vastus lateralis showed good agreement between the dummy segments and reference models. The use of the dummy segments allows the study of aligned kinetics and misaligned kinematics from the same model. The method will be used in a future study to evaluate the exoskeleton with more subjects.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Machine Learning', 'Bioinformatics']"

To create 3D objects the method of functional-voxel modeling is used, which is successfully applied to a wide variety of tasks in the geometric formulation. Model creation is divided into three stages. The initial stage of creating a 3D model is its description in a specialized programming language. With the help of this language it is possible, using the V. L. Rvachev’s functions—R-functions, to define complex and manifold geometric shapes and operations quite easily. The second stage of model creation is its “growing” in the form of voxels, the number of which depends on the degree of required accuracy of the model, its partitioning. Here, the calculation of geometry using parallelism and shader programs on the GPU. The final stage is the visualization of the resulting models in point, voxel and smooth geometric form.

Although it has not gained as much research interest in the AEC industry in recent years as other ML and optimization techniques, RL has been responsible for recent major scientific breakthroughs, such as Deep Mind’s AlphaGo and AlphaFold algorithms. However, due the singularity of the problems and challenges of the AEC industry in contrast to the reduced number of benchmark environments and games in which new RL algorithms are commonly tested, little progress has been noticed so far towards the implementation of RL in this sector.

The mmWave radar shows advantages in low cost, low power, environment robustness and capability in material classification. In this paper, the capability of mmWave radar to perform industrial multi-material classification with obstruction is studied by measuring the reflected radar signal. The classified materials are common engineering materials which include metal, polymer, ceramic, composite and natural. The experiment is conducted using the IWR1443BOOST mmWave radar sensor. From a series of experiment results, the received radar signal is the unique material signature of a target object. The relative power measured by IWR1443BOOST is correlated to the target object’s relative permeability and permittivity. This indicated the mmWave radar can easily pick up unique material properties as well as the physical structure of target object with minor assistance from deep neural network model. Three models which are linear classifier, fully connected neural network (FCNN) and convolution neural network (CNN) are trained and inference on the radar signal. CNN shows the most robust performance even under noise, while linear classifier converges fastest. All models achieved satisfactory accuracy with minimum amount of training epochs. This is because the radar signals are having clear discriminative distribution as proven in standard deviation against mean plot. The models also perform under 16 mm thick obstruction and can classify less than 5 mm thin material. From the experiment, the mmWave radar provides highly accurate multi-material classification with deep neural network.

The beam is assumed to be sufficiently long to consider 2D flow and has symmetric as well as asymmetric shape morphing curvature while oscillating in a fluid. The fluid-structure interaction problem is modelled by considering the unsteady Stokes equation. The resulting 1D boundary integral problem is solved by the boundary element method (BEM) numerically in MATLAB to obtain the desired pressure distribution on the beam. It is found that as the frequency oscillation of the rigid beam is increased, both the damping as well as added mass effects are decreased at different rates due to the gradual decrease in unsteady viscous layer. Finally, the hydrodynamic coupling effect on the beam is demonstrated at $$\beta =0.1$$ . However, for increase in the symmetric and asymmetric shape morphing parameters, the hydrodynamic decoupling appears lower than the gap ratio 5. The cantilever beam with optimal shape morphing parameter can be useful for the optimal designs of atomic force microscopy (AFM).","['Engineering', 'Nanotechnology and Microengineering', 'Mechatronics', 'Machinery and Machine Elements']"

This sequential process is extremely time-consuming and more importantly, knowledge from the fine-tuned model stays local and can not be re-used or leveraged collaboratively.

This situation occurs for example for the case of solar quadcopters that require a large structure to have onboard PV panels for the power supply and battery recharging. Flexibility may manifests itself as mechanical oscillations and static deflections, greatly complicating the motion control of a quadcopter platform. If the time to settle the oscillations is significant relative to the cycle time of the overall task, flexibility will be a major consideration in the flight control design, and a degradation of the overall expected system performance typically occurs. For quadcopters with flexible frames, it is difficult to use the Euler-Lagrange or Newtonian approach to derive the dynamic model as is done with small and rigid quadrotors. Many relevant factors that lead to the consideration of the distributed flexibility should be analyzed. To deal with this challenge, an optimal approach for sizing the frame and platform structure is followed. This is achieved by using a modern approach to computer modeling of quadcopters through the integration process of SolidWorks CAD modeling and MATLAB/Simulink environments. This is followed by identifying the resonant frequencies of the model using ANSYS Workbench. Initially, a SolidWorks model is created and then imported into MATLAB Simscape Multibody. Then, the transfer functions of the quadrotor model are derived using system identification. Subsequently, the equivalent transfer functions from the Simulink model are obtained and used for the PID controllers design. The validity of the quadcopter model represents an essential step to simulate the model before flying the quadcopter in the real world. It brings confidence that when the commands are run on the actual quadrotor, they will bring the same results. The design procedure for modeling a dynamical model of a large quadcopter and the tuning of its PID-based control strategies has been successfully implemented for a solar-quadcopter prototype, creating a reliable and effective automatic navigation and control system.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

doi:10.1007/978-981-19-2635-8_36,en,Predictive Artificial Potential Field for UAV Obstacle Avoidance,OriginalPaper,"A method to generate sequential obstacle avoidance trajectories for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is proposed. The proposed Predictive Artificial Potential Field (P-APF) method can generate smoother and less time-delayed avoidance trajectories in real time while maintaining the same high avoidance performance and low computational load as the conventional APF method. It is expected that the use of UAVs in transportation systems will increase, and the proposed P-APF method is highly effective in situations where multiple UAVs perform respective operations in the same flight envelope. The P-APF method generates a potential field and repulsion vectors based on current information and also on predicted future UAV trajectories and observed obstacles. Thus, since prediction is incorporated into the trajectory generation process, the proposed method can generate trajectories that start avoiding obstacles earlier than the conventional APF method. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, simulations of a UAV avoiding static or dynamic obstacles were conducted using the proposed method and the conventional method. The results confirmed that the P-APF method can maintain safety and take evasive action with a smaller delay than the conventional method.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

There are several workflows in the industry that can only be solved efficiently and productively with robots. These robots are equipped with various accessories, such as grippers, sensors and, if necessary, an image processing system. There are tasks where traditional robot programming with fixed coordinates is not enough; visual information about the workspace and workpiece is needed. The problem, especially in smaller companies, is that the existing robot needs to be upgraded, for example, with a visual sensor and an image processing system, but this is usually difficult and costly for older robots and robot controllers. The aim of my research is to create a solution that allows a robot controller to be economically equipped with an image processing system that is not prepared for this at the factory. All that is required for the controller to be able to communicate with the outside world via some communication interface. An external image processing system, which can be a standard PC with the appropriate camera and software, is required. The image processing software running on the PC communicates with the robot controller, and the robot program receives the necessary information from the image processing system via the communication channel.","['Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering']"

It improves the reuse rate of software codes and provides a unified platform for application developers. However, ROS runs on Linux, which takes up a large amount of memory and cannot provide timing guarantees for robot motion. Although the strategy of porting ROS to embedded real-time operating systems has become a popular solution to these problems, this technique is challenging to efficiently adopt in space robot systems due to real-time multi-tasking, scalability, and performance requirements. This paper proposes an operating system architecture Space-ROS based on the embedded real-time operating system SpaceOS, we introduce a part of ROS function instead of overall on RTOS to ensure the lightweight of the system. Space-ROS adopts a three-level scheduling strategy suitable for multi-cores processors to ensure the efficient operation of real-time multi-tasks and uses a dynamic loading function to improve the scalability of the system, this function supports online updates of applications. In addition, we have also designed intelligent interactive functions, which can conveniently plan and design the action tasks of space robots, greatly improves the efficiency and interactive experience of developers.

The designed press brake comprises of the frame balance, conveyor rollers and support, belt, chuck, six hydraulic cylinders assembled with bolts and nuts. The buckling force was determined analytically and compared with the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulation to prevent distortion of length and section. The Von mises stress theory was used to determine the stress, resultant load and displacement. The results obtained from the FEA simulation were compared with the mechanical properties of the hydraulic press brake. The maximum stress induced is significantly lower than the tensile strength of the hydraulic press brake. Hence, the stress induced due to bending cannot cause the cast alloy to yield. Also, the buckling force significantly exceeds the resultant force giving no chances for buckling. The designed hydraulic press brake is flexible enough to control using hydraulic cylinders and enhances sufficient strength and rigidity during clamping and loading conditions.","['Engineering', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering', 'Computer-Aided Engineering (CAD, CAE) and Design']"

It has aroused worldwide attention in the academic and industrial communities since it was first proposed in 2013. Stimuli-response materials play a critical role in the relation of 4D printing.

The objective of this study was to develop a powered exoskeleton that can follow human movements and significantly augment instantaneous movements. This paper describes the effect of the attachment position of the exoskeleton on human jumping height, which has not been clarified before, through the analysis of experiments using a jumping robot. Clarifying this effect is significant in that it will facilitate the development of jumping powered exoskeletons. Related studies include jumping exoskeletons using motors and artificial muscles. However, these exoskeletons have not been able to significantly augment the jumping height, and exoskeletons capable of significantly augmenting instantaneous movements have not yet been developed. This paper describes a comparison of the enhancement of the jumping height by different attachment methods when the exoskeleton is attached to a jumping robot in parallel or in series. It was estimated that the jump height was 1.06 and 1.18 times higher with the exoskeleton attached than without it, in parallel and in series, respectively. This confirms that the powered exoskeleton is expected to be significant, especially in the serial attachment, and that an enhanced jumping height can be expected. These results have the potential to significantly accelerate the development of powered exoskeletons that augment jumping motion by clarifying the effect of the exoskeleton’s attachment method on the jumping height.","['Engineering', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Robotics', 'Computational Intelligence']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-04098-6_8,en,Digital Image Correlation with a Neuromorphic Event-Based Imager,OriginalPaper,"Digital image correlation is a well-established method for estimating the full-field displacement of two-dimensional surfaces by comparing pairs of images. The basic idea is to attach a texture or speckle pattern to the surface, and track the features of this pattern through the grayscale values of the image pixels. All this assumes a conventional camera that records image intensity at every pixel in every frame, which is inefficient for sharp transient events. In watching a balloon burst, for example, one needs a high frame rate to capture the details of the burst, but storing such a frame rate for the longer, slower expansion of the balloon before it bursts costs a lot of memory. It would be convenient, in applications such as monitoring structures, to store dense information only during dynamic events, not between them. Silicon retinas are an alternative sensor type that record events rather than pixels. The raw data for such a device are a sequence of 4-tuples: the time at which each event occurred, the horizontal and vertical pixel coordinates containing the event, and whether the event involved increasing or decreasing intensity. Events can be reassembled into buckets corresponding to each pixel and a time interval corresponding to any desired camera shutter to produce frames analogous to those of a conventional camera. This project assesses whether it is feasible to combine digital image correlation or a similarly developed computer vision technique with the efficient storage of a silicon retina, via such converted frames. The test article for this experiment was a latex band with a painted speckled pattern, mounted into the stationary and moving ends of a frame and subject to cyclical stretching. The image of this band was recorded simultaneously on conventional and silicon retina detectors through a beam splitter. Analysis of the resulting data showed that the silicon retina frames allow feature tracking with close to the quality of a conventional camera, but the computed displacements are consistently smaller. The surface has to accelerate before there are enough changes to register on the silicon retina, and this initial motion at either end of the oscillation is not recorded in the converted frames. This work demonstrates that silicon retina imagers have potential for persistent surveillance applications where there is a need to record sparsely occurring transient deformations over long time periods.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

The leg contact of the quadruped with the environment is an impulsive contact with a non-smooth interaction. This impulsive force is resisted by the torques applied at the leg joints of the model, and hence, the realistic estimate of these resisting torques is vital for the stable operation of the robot. In the current study, the dynamic model of a planar two-legged mobile robot is formulated for an impact problem by utilizing the external impact model as proposed by Lee et al. (Modeling and analysis of internal impact for general classes of robotic mechanisms. In: Proceedings. IEEE/RSJ international conference on intelligent robots and systems, vol. 3, pp. 1955–1962, 2000 [ 1 ]). The impulse encountered during contact of the leg foot with the ground is utilized as the basis to compute the resisting forces at the joints in the model. These resisting joint forces due to impact can be used to decide the configuration of mobile robot leg during landing on the ground. From the simulation, it is established that the impact force on the joints is greatest when the orientation of the lower link of the leg is perpendicular to the contact environment.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics']"

In this chapter, a four-dimensional hyperchaotic system is introduced and analyzed through calculation of bifurcation diagrams and Lyapunov exponents. The system is a modification of the system proposed by Li and Sprott (Int J Bifurcation Chaos 24:1450034, 2014) and a generalization of the system in Moysis et al. ( Int J Dyn Control:1–11, 2020). The system has no rest points and thus belongs to the category of systems with hidden attractors. The system is then applied to the problem of chaotic area exploration. The aim here is to combine the dynamics of the chaotic system with the motion dynamics of an autonomous robot exploring an area. This results into a chaotic and unpredictable motion that nonetheless ensures coverage of the given area. Such a technique can be useful for exploration or patrolling tasks. Numerical simulations are performed to study the coverage achieved with respect to simulation time. The case of multiple robots is also considered.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Plasma Physics', 'Applications of Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos Theory', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Complex Systems']"

Tissue or organ transplantation has hence been a major conventional option for replacing the diseased or dysfunctional body parts of the patients. In fact, a great number of patients on waiting lists would benefit tremendously if tissue and organs could be replaced with biomimetic spare parts on demand. Herein, regenerative medicine and advanced biomaterials strive to reach this distant goal. Tissue engineering aims to create new biological tissue or organ substitutes, and promote regeneration of damaged or diseased tissue and organs. This approach has been jointly evolving with the major advances in biomaterials, stem cells, and additive manufacturing technologies. In particular, three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting utilizes 3D printing to fabricate viable tissue-like structures (perhaps organs in the future) using bioinks composed of special hydrogels, cells, growth factors, and other bioactive contents. A third generation of multifunctional biomaterials could also show opportunities for building biomimetic scaffolds, upon which to regenerate stem cells in vivo. Besides, decellularization technology based on isolation of extracellular matrix of tissue and organs from their inhabiting cells is presented as an alternative to synthetic biomaterials. Today, the gained knowledge of functional microtissue engineering and biointerfaces, along with the remarkable advances in pluripotent stem cell technology, seems to be instrumental for the development of more realistic microphysiological 3D in vitro tissue models, which can be utilized for personalized disease modeling and drug development. This chapter will discuss the recent advances in the field of regenerative medicine and biomaterials, alongside challenges, limitations, and potentials of the current technologies.","['Life Sciences', 'Biological Techniques', 'Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences/Technology']"
doi:10.1007/978-981-19-0968-9_39,en,Agent-Based Modelling as a Decision-Support System for Project Delivery Methods,OriginalPaper,"Cost overruns, schedule delays, claims, and disputes are regularly faced issues in most construction projects. While the reasons are numerous, one common cause is inappropriate selection of the project delivery method. Founding a project on an inappropriate delivery method not only disrupts schedule and cost plans, but also wrecks professional relationships and puts stakeholders’ futures at stake. Several attempts have been made to assist owners in selecting a suitable project delivery method. However, there is not much research that uses computer simulation to aid in the delivery method selection process. The aim of this study is to develop a decision-support system for project delivery methods. Agent-based modelling and simulation (ABMS) are employed to simulate different scenarios of different project conditions, allowing owners to select the best delivery method for each case. This decision-support system calculates scores for each delivery method and displays expected results that facilitate the selection process. A sample application is implemented to demonstrate the system. Finally, the conclusion and future recommendations are presented.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"
