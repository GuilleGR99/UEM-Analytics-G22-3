doi:10.1007/978-3-031-10137-3_8,en,Esotericism and Matter: Damanhur’s Post-Falco Spirituality,OriginalPaper,"In this chapter I shall investigate Damanhur’s “post-Falco” spiritual world. My starting point is the changes introduced into the community’s spiritual-magical-esoteric programme in 2018 by Falco’s closest followers, the “Wise Members”, whose task it was to carry the programme forward after his death and to lead the “School of Meditation” and the hierarchy of initiates. These changes, expressed as updating Damanhur’s eschatological mission which intends to “Damanhurize the planet”, are the basis of its recent—more emphasized than in the past—opening to the outside world. The thesis I shall propose is that Damanhur, responding to the changes gradually undertaken in order to open itself to the world, has attenuated its original characteristics which had earned it the name of “sect”. Today it seems to be approaching a certain—less greedy and totalitarian—form of social organization of the “sect” type closer to those of contemporary spirituality whose barycentre of authority is shifted from the community to the subject and where spiritual experience is no longer necessarily tied to life experience.","['Religious Studies', 'Spirituality', 'History of World War II and the Holocaust']"
doi:10.1007/978-981-16-7487-7_10,en,Synthesis and Technology Mapping for In-Memory Computing,OriginalPaper,"In this chapter, we introduce the preliminaries of in-memory computing processing-in-memory platforms, such as memristive Memory Processing Units (mMPU), which allow leveraging data locality and performing stateful logic operations. To allow computing of arbitrary Boolean functions using such novel computing platforms, development of design automation flows (EDA) are of critical importance. Typically, EDA flows consist of multiple phases. Technology-independent logic synthesis is the first step, where the input Boolean function is restructured without any specific technology constraints, which is generally followed by a technology-dependent optimization phase, where technology specific hints are used for optimization of the data structure obtained from the first step. The final step is technology mapping, which takes the optimized function representation to implement it using technology-specific constraints. In this chapter, we present an end-to-end mapping framework for mMPU with various mapping objectives. We begin the chapter by presenting an optimal technology mapping method with the goal of mapping a Boolean function on a single row of mMPU. Thereafter, we propose a Look-Up Table (LUT) based mapping that attempts at minimizing delay of mapping, without any area constraints. We extend this method to work with area-constraints. The proposed framework is modular and can be improved with more efficient heuristics as well as technology-specific optimizations. We present benchmarking results with other approaches throughout this chapter.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Electronic Circuits and Devices', 'Processor Architectures', 'Nanotechnology', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation']"

The analysis is made according to the socio-historical context of each historical province of contemporary Romania. In Transylvania and the Banat, a Western-inspired persecution pattern functioned: we took here in consideration only those trials in which some of the many Romanians living in these provinces were involved. In Moldavia, only one trial from 1761 is known, which is carefully placed in the context of the magical beliefs and practices of Moldavian population of the past centuries. Wallachia offers a much richer harvest of witchcraft cases between 1586 and 1859, with three executions for witchcraft, but which had an obvious political substratum. At the end of the chapter, an interpretation model inspired by risk-management theory is applied, on three levels, in order to highlight some contextual specificities of Romanian culture: the institutional level (implicitly that of legislation), the community level and the intrapersonal level (the last being an essentially subjective one, encompassing the feelings of each individual).","['History', 'European History', 'Cultural History', 'Social History']"

These representations have in common that they visually describe a series of extremely violent physical tortures endured for the sin of witchcraft: beating, biting by snakes, riding by the devil, rape, unquenchable fire, impalement. There are several iconographic types that were identified and analysed depending on the socio-artistic context in which they appeared and developed: the witch in the river or the sea of fire, the witch ridden by the devil or riding him, the milk or manna thief with a bucket on the head or around the neck, the groups of practitioners of magic burning in hellfire and so on. The Romanian iconographic representations were compared with the data collected by folklorists during field researches and with paintings from Bulgaria or Ukraine, in order to discern which of their details belong to the high theological culture and which could be related to oral folk culture.","['History', 'European History', 'Cultural History', 'Social History']"

In the early modern world, Romanians used codes of Byzantine origin, in which the punishments stipulated for witchcraft were always religious: the prohibition of Holy Communion for a period of several years, accompanied by other gestures of penance. The Orthodox context of the respective legislative measure is extremely important and its specificities need to be highlighted. Requirement of the death penalty for witchcraft was extremely rare. The emergence of modern legislation has led to the disappearance of the crime of witchcraft, which was still mentioned only when it was associated with theft, deception and illegal practice of medicine. At the end of the chapter, the concept of misogyny is discussed, to explain the constitution of the image of the witch in the codes of laws, but also in other documents with legislative implications (sermons, instructions for confessors, etc.).","['History', 'European History', 'Cultural History', 'Social History']"

The Life of Basil the Younger and the Apocalypsis Mariae were very influential in early modern Romanian culture, spread through dozens of different copies and variants. They contain detailed descriptions of hell and the punishments that sinners suffer there for the bad deeds they might have committed in earthly life. The focus is on the exemplary punishment of witchcraft: those guilty of it are considered the only ones definitively sentenced at the time of their individual judgement without any possibility of rising from the dead for the Last Judgement. However, the sin of witchcraft must be interpreted as part of a network of transgressions, in relation to other sins that cause it or derive from it.","['History', 'European History', 'Cultural History', 'Social History']"

The second section sets out the thesis that frames the entire volume, according to which Damanhur constitutes an example of a religious community that was initially born with a sectarian character and closed its borders to the surrounding society, but which over time, following above all the discovery of the underground temple and the death of the charismatic leader, gradually opened up to the world. With this openness, Damanhur lost its initial sectarian connotation, taking on the profile of a more legitimised and integrated spiritual community in the surrounding area, with which it established increasingly intense relations and exchanges.","['Religious Studies', 'Spirituality', 'History of World War II and the Holocaust']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-10137-3_2,en,A Technocity Utopia,OriginalPaper,"This chapter will analyse the emergence of the Damanhurian utopia as a city-state in the area not far from Turin called Technocity, due to the high presence of research sectors and advanced technologies. The historical context was the Seventies Spiritual Revolution where movements arose around charismatic founders, newagers communities, green villages. Here mystical traditions, therapeutic sciences and anarchist experiments coexisted. The dream was the importance of positive thinking, the enhancement of personal experiences, the holistic vision of the relationship between man and things, the feeling of belonging to a greater whole, science-religion alliance. As the founder said: “Damanhur is not a religion, it is a philosophy of life”. Damanhur’s emergence is the result of the founder’s vision, the experimentation of a new philosophy of life, the awakening of human potential, the Damanhurians’ sense of community, the very root of all things and the magical forces in each of them. There was a recurrence of what happened in the Middle Ages, when the foundation of a monastery gave new life to abandoned, uninhabited and marginal territories. Damanhur’s settlement in Valchiusella in 1976—at that time depopulated and deindustrialised—also resulted in its gradual transformation into a large multi-purpose centre for art, culture and activities. The symbol that represented the dream and message of the Damanhurians since their very beginning were the Temples of Humankind , a metaphor for self-building, the fascination of research, the aesthetic invention of forms, the centrality of play, the awakening of the Divine inside and outside of oneself, the mystical pole to which everyone refers with their symbolic presence. The Temples of Humankind still remain the most vivid epiphany of the Damanhurian utopia. Here we find the ecumenical vision of things containing symbols, myths, traditions, languages, selfic patterns, labyrinths, the halls of earth, water, spheres, metals and mirrors.","['Religious Studies', 'Spirituality', 'History of World War II and the Holocaust']"

In the name of “Enlightened Christianity,” magic and witchcraft began to be seen as vain and ridiculous superstitions. The fear of witchcraft diminished, thanks to literacy and the spread of written culture among the masses, in an effort led by the intellectual elites, who emancipated themselves from the absolute tutelage of the Churches, although some of their members were still priests (Gh. Șincai, Petru Maior, D. Țichindeal), while others were lawyers (D. Bojincă). The description of the general condition of the Romanian population is not neglected here either: the commoners continued to be very attached to magical beliefs throughout the Age of Enlightenment, as shown by some foreign travellers (Wilkinson, Paget, Demidov, Noyes).","['History', 'European History', 'Cultural History', 'Social History']"

Second, we try to elaborate a theoretical model for interpreting the studied phenomena, based on ideas and postulates from risk-management theory, which seems to be very useful for understanding the way in which the Romanian communities have constructed their discourses on witchcraft. In parallel with this theoretical model, some studies on witchcraft in the Romanian cultural area, that have been published in English (Eliade, Senn, Benga, Neagota, Timotin), are discussed in order to underline the new aspects and insights the present book tries to put forward.","['History', 'European History', 'Cultural History', 'Social History']"

The first essay, “The living and the artificial”, gives an account of the convergence of two trends: the production of artificial objects which mimic human behaviour and the artificial programming of human behaviour. Both are outcomes of Western culture and of a conception of the object-world of a transcendent subject. Both move in the direction of an object which is artificially alive and to the artificially mechanised man. This, involving the “materialization of the spirit”, threatens to do away with the “transcendent subject” and annihilate humanity. The second essay, “Towards the new man”, examines the issue of technological domination and the subsequent alteration and decline of values. This “absurd” replacement of models of behaviour by modes of operation, by pseudo-values, by technocracy, by the absence of decision-making and engagement, of post-humanity, raises the prospect of a “new man”, he who will live and consume, a passive and patient being, lacking agency, indecisive, without values. The third essay, “Technique as argument”, reflects on the paradox of our living in a world which is produced by a specific type of “magic” – technique –, but in which at the same time the faith in that magic is profoundly undermined. This is because we no longer believe that the operation of technique is due to the “wisdom” of the “pure science” which sustains it, and also because the potency of the novelty it may bring has been used to maintain the existing structures of a hollowed out civilizational project. Today technique is a mere argument, one which is apparently progressive but in fact conservative. Are we able to read into these three essays of Flusser’s an appeal for a technique which might offer us a true vision of the new?","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy of Technology', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'History of Technology']"

Among these are Ecuadorian American Zoraida Córdova’s “Brooklyn Brujas” series of young adult novels; OpenTV’s web series Brujos , chronicling the exploits of a group of witches, who are also doctoral students, as they evade being hunted by the descendants of the original New World colonizers; and the CW network’s reboot of the television series Charmed , which now locates the power of magic in three Afro-Latina sisters who are reunited after their mother’s death. The bruja narratives examined in this chapter combine recovered knowledges with the tools of contemporary theory in order to critique a prior generation that withheld this knowledge and to battle structural injustices—particularly those related to the environment and the management of natural resources—that materialize in the narratives as embodied threats. This chapter also considers how these narratives use imagined recovered traditions in order to establish forms of Latinidad that precede nationality, resulting in either a generic Latinidad, as in Córdova’s novels, or new coalitions that imagine a future beyond the histories of particular national identifications.","['Literature', 'Latin American/Caribbean Literature', 'Fiction', 'Latin American Cinema and TV', 'Latin American Culture']"

Despite the potential benefits, identity violation, copyright infringement, illegal re-distribution, and unauthorized access have all been significant. To address all these breaches, in this paper, a reversible medical image watermarking scheme using interpolation is proposed. The medical image is partitioned into Border Region (BR), Region of Interest (ROI), and Region of Non-interest (RONI) regions. BR is used for embedding integrity checksum code generated from ROI for tamper detection. RONI is used for embedding watermark. To ensure complete recovery of ROI and high embedding capacity, ROI is compressed before embedding. To ensure high-security compressed ROI, hospital emblem and EHR merged and then encrypted using a random key generated from Polybius magic square to get higher security. The proposed scheme is proved to take less computational time as there are no complex functions used in the embedding. The experiments performed on the proposed scheme is proved to have high imperceptibility, robustness, embedding capacity, security, and less computational time. All these confirm that the proposed approach is a potential candidate for suitable in smart healthcare environment.","['Computer Science', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It is the result of field research centred on dialogue with various Damanhurians, in some cases long-time community members, in others recent newcomers to the community. The chapter analyses women’s involvement in magic and in the practice of therapeutic healing. The aim of this study is to observe, processes of change and reinvention in the community from the perspective of gender and occupation, following the death of the founder Falco Tarassaco. The current strong female presence in the field of magic suggests the evolution of a community model often defined as patriarchal. A very central concept in this analysis is the notion of the androgynous, deeply rooted in Damanhur cosmogony and worldview, shaping its gender relations.","['Religious Studies', 'Spirituality', 'History of World War II and the Holocaust']"

It used a quantitative research method using a survey tool designed to investigate a sample of citizens in Jordan in reference to their attitudes and behaviours of using both social media and traditional media during the Covid-19 pandemic. Regardless of all the criticism around the simplicity of the bullet theory and its assumption of an all-passive audience when it comes to receiving media messages, this research tests its applicability and relevance in times of pandemics and crises. The study found that Hypodermic Needle Theory remains of a much relevance to assess citizens behaviours during times of pandemics and crisis such as Covid-19. The study revealed that social media was more followed by the study sample during the pandemic to seek information. The perceived media effects were also higher for social media (M = 3.52) in comparison to traditional official media (M = 2.92). The study hypotheses shown no significant differences between males and females regarding their level of following Covid-19 topics and content which means they both follow it equally. Likewise, the study revealed no significant differences between the participants’ age, education level and place of residence in relation to their following of Covid-19 over both social media and traditional media and its effects on the participants. Therefore, this study justifies the continued relevance of the bullet theory in times of crises such as Covid-19. These results also provide a stepping-stone for future empirical research in which investigates more on the effects of the media messages on audiences taking into account the scale of both information and misinformation online in times of crises.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

As intimate strangers, they became part of neighborhood bars and shops, and became immersed in East German family life, despite governments’ attempts to maintain distance between the temporary international guests and the East German population. Chapter 5 argues that the workers’ social life of socialism vacillated between modes of inclusion and exclusion. It therefore focuses on human affective relationships ranging from romantic encounters and family formation to racist and xenophobic hate crimes, illustrating how the migrants carved out their own social spaces in an increasingly hostile environment. The first section explores the migrants’ integration and their intimate, cross-cultural relationships with East Germans and others. The second part examines how migrants experienced exclusion. The grounds were, variously, sexism, racism, xenophobia, and ethnic tensions. Integration and exclusion reflect two contrasting ends on the scale of human affective relationships, but the central theme of this chapter is how love and hate, intimacy and exclusion, and friendship and racism are intricately tied up with one another.","['History', 'World History, Global and Transnational History', 'African History', 'European History', 'Labor History', 'Migration']"

But many natural and un-natural causes exist and behave an obstruction to extract best performance from PV systems. The popular unacceptable causes are partial shading conditions (PSCs), which affects the PV performance highly. To diminish the effect of PSCs, relevant PV module rearrangement method is another good solution. In this paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique demonstrates the current equalization of PV array systems under PSCs. In that method, a particle reaches the optimum value depending on its present velocity, past experience, and the experience of its nearby group members. Also, traditional arrangement techniques such as the series–parallel (SP) and total cross-tied (TCT) configurations have been used. As a result, performance parameters such as power and voltage at global maximum power point (GMPP), PL, and fill factor (FF) have been assessed. This paper displays the methods of implementation of the techniques to avert the effect of PSCs and to improve the energy output of the PV array under non-uniform irradiation circumstances. MATLAB/Simulink modelling is carried out to compare the results of various reconfiguration techniques and to find out which one is the best one under considered PSCs.","['Engineering', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Energy Systems']"

A lot of work is devoted to the load transfers, which requires an in depth suspension analysis. This leads to the definition of the suspension and vehicle internal coordinates, of the no-roll centers and no-roll axis, for both independent and dependent suspensions. The case of three-axle vehicles is also considered. In the end, the vehicle model for handling and performance is formulated in a synthetic, yet precise way. A general description of the mechanics of differential mechanisms, either open or limited-slip is included.","['Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Complexity', 'Control and Systems Theory']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-13862-1_9,en,Through Consciousness Parted from Dream: Alternative Knowledge Forms in Karoline von Günderrode,OriginalPaper,"Karoline von Günderrode’s reputation as a mystical writer makes her a likely candidate as a proponent of a negative philosophy. However, the historical emphasis on Günderrode’s mystical and lyrical writings reflects gender stereotypes about women’s writing and ignores Günderrode’s strengths as an epic and historical writer. It is therefore important to approach claims about Günderrode’s supposed mysticism carefully. This paper is a preliminary attempt to investigate Günderrode’s claims about knowledge, including knowledge of the absolute, asking: What does Günderrode think knowledge is? What does she think the purpose of knowledge is—i.e., what does she think knowledge gets us, or does for us? And how do her claims differ from those philosophers, such as Novalis, whose thinking on knowledge (including of the absolute) seems to resemble hers? I argue that Günderrode maintains that human beings can experience, or “know,” a reality behind the discrete objects and events that comprise the world of appearances, and that she integrates this idea into a coherent worldview in a unique way. Specifically, I argue that Günderrode reconceptualizes the nature of death and selfhood in specific ways that allow her to make sense of the possibility of experiencing the true nature of the world behind the divisions that are characteristic of human knowledge and existence.","['Philosophy', 'German Idealism', 'Continental Philosophy', 'History of Philosophy']"

As HbA1c is the measure of the fraction of glycated hemoglobin out of total hemoglobin in red blood cells, both blood glucose levels and blood cell conditions affect levels of HbA1c. Consistently, genome-wide association studies on HbA1c have identified multiple genetic loci, largely grouped into two separate pathways – via the glycemic pathway and via the erythrocyte pathway. Two genetic variants, G6PD -rs1050828 and HBB -rs334, specifically found in individuals with African ancestry, were noted for their relatively large effects on HbA1c via the erythrocytic pathway, compared to other genetic variants. The glycemic status of individuals carrying the HbA1c-lowering alleles might be underestimated by HbA1c levels, as lower HbA1c level is observed compared to their actual glycemic status due to their genetic influences on blood cell biology. In addition, several erythrocyte-related genetic variants of small effects may also have a combined impact on HbA1c in this regard. Thus, the influences of these non-glycemic-related variants need to be considered when the HbA1c test is performed to measure glycemic status.","['Biomedicine', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Pharmacology/Toxicology']"

Animating can be understood as make-believe using motion. It prompts us to imagine fictitious worlds as seen from diverse perspectives through the representation of motion, and it encompasses the experience of sharing the resulting images with others. Animating is significant for art education as a practice that encourages understanding others and the feeling of being connected with the world. However, the phenomenal body of the subject who does the representation cannot be separated from the semiotic body that is being represented. The mutual interaction between these two bodies needs to be maintained, and the significance of animating in terms of art education diminishes as the tension in that relationship dissipates. Digital technology has the advantage of enabling automated production and manipulation of the semiotic body and reducing the labor required for production but, in terms of the practice of animating in art education, teachers need to be cognizant of instruction that makes learners recognize their own phenomenal body and encourages receptivity to the phenomenal body of others.","['Education', 'Creativity and Arts Education', 'Education, general']"

Current pedagogies for developing innovation skills and innovation of workplace practices are epistemologically misguided. As a result the risk of failure is high, leading to many finding innovation intimidating. This chapter examines the factors which improve enterprise success in innovation and the “unlearning” necessary to avoid reverting to former ways of working. Learning how to deliver better outcomes, when the route to their attainment is uncertain, requires a fundamentally different process from when the link between cause and effect is clear. Traditional knowledge transfer “banking” approaches (Friere, 1969 ) will not work if the answers to “teach” are yet to be found. This “learning paradox” provides the theoretical foundation for a new pedagogy illustrated by successful enterprise innovation initiatives. We argue that innovation is itself a form of learning, which enterprises must master to create successful new products and ways of working. Success achieves outcomes at levels 3 or 4 in Kirkpatrick’s training evaluation model (Kirkpatrick & Kirkpatrick, Evaluating training programs (Vol. Third Edition), 2008), requiring behavior change and improved key performance metrics, respectively. These go far beyond traditional assessments of educational attainment (level 2). Employees learn for work and also “through work” (Billett, Journal of Workplace Learning, 13(5), 209–214, 2001), to acquire skills and develop capabilities to embrace technological and digital disruption. Case studies from Singapore and the United Kingdom show commonalities between different types of innovation initiatives highlighting best practice in the pedagogy of innovation.","['Education', 'Education, general']"

During that visit, the island undergoes an outbreak from a mysterious disease that attaches itself to the infected body like a “black mold-fungus” that then “gradually started taking you over.” Named “La Negrura” for its capacity to re-blacken already black skin, the disease turns the infected into proto-zombies at first and full “zombies” by the end of the story. Gil’Adí show’s how Díaz’s oeuvre is constructed around depictions of the Caribbean as a postapocalyptic space and Afro-Latinxs as science-fiction embodiments. The figure of the zombie here expands the concept of “ fukú americanus,” which Díaz uses in The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao (2007) . “Monstro” presents the Caribbean (and the Americas) as instantiated into modernity by this curse of the New World ( fukú ), which remains into the present as a haunting presence and allows Díaz to narrate the Caribbean as a space created through a cataclysmic rift that emits dead bodies. Díaz exhumes the histories of colonialism, slavery, embodied labor, and racial expendability: histories that demonstrate an inescapable pattern of violence. The zombies’ mass groupings and screams become a form of racial protest against the histories that created them as dead subjects.","['Literature', 'Latin American/Caribbean Literature', 'Fiction', 'Latin American Cinema and TV', 'Latin American Culture']"

What are his early and mature works? And his personal, private level? What is the genesis of his development as a pranotherapist and seer? What were his first steps towards the origins of Damanhur as an esoteric community? During The enterprise began to take shape in 1975–1976, and Airaudi became Falco. The reasons behind his choice to build the Federation of the Community and the Subterranean Temple of Humankind were closely linked with magic and esotericism. In 1980 Airaudi began to paint esoteric paintings, with many possible interpretations, areas of interest for Damanhurians and for foreign interlocutors. The traumatic raid on the Temple took place in 1992, followed by a long-lasting struggle to protect the site. Some Italian Universities—mainly those of Turin and Rome la Sapienza—helped to collect signatures, ensuring the Temple’s survival. In 1996 the court magistrate of Ivrea ruled against its demolition. It would be opened to the public, thereby sacrificing some of its air of mystery. Falco indicated self-sufficiency as a method, a goal which the community never fully reached. Selfica—magic objects with therapeutic qualities—were developed. Sacred spaces were designated in the woods. Research into pranotherapy was intensified. During the same period his family circumstances changed radically: he got married and had two children—and then a third child was born outside marriage. Adopting the additional name Tarassaco (dandelion), he raised the baby, dedicating considerable time and attention to her. Sometimes he appeared dissatisfied that the Community is too dependent on him, becoming too comfortable, and threatens to leave. After His death on June 23, 2013, left everyone shaken. Members, however, were eager to move forward and make their voices heard. Letters written by him, and discovered at yearly intervals after his death, arrived in Damanhur. Still arriving, they testify that Falco Tarassaco would agree with the members.","['Religious Studies', 'Spirituality', 'History of World War II and the Holocaust']"

For this purpose, we study heat transfer in a graphene-like (or honeycomb) lattice to demonstrate thermal edge states with robustness against defects and disorders. Convection is compared to electron cyclotron, which breaks space-reversal symmetry and determines the direction of thermal edge propagation. Diffusion leads to interference-like behavior between opposite convections, preventing bulk temperature propagation. We also display thermal unidirectional interface states between two lattices with opposite convection. These results extend the physics of edge states beyond wave systems.","['Physics', 'Optics, Lasers, Photonics, Optical Devices', 'Thermodynamics', 'Optical and Electronic Materials', 'Materials Science, general', 'Theoretical, Mathematical and Computational Physics', 'Condensed Matter Physics']"

The authors believe that relevant scenarios in a 360-degree video format will be beneficial for nursing students, specifically in preparation for the clinical setting. The potential of 360-degree video in virtual reality (VR) gives the instructor flexibility to create systematic, experiential learning and shapes emotional learning in collaboration with students. 360-Degree video can be seen as a playful way to learn in new situations.

This is because there are too many things that could affect power delivery to multiple devices on a system. These include DC resistance of PCB traces or power/ground planes, AC impedance of PCB traces, power supply decoupling around the DSP, and or other surrounding circuits such as DDR, clocks, and analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters. One of the most challenging tasks for designers is to determine the best decoupling techniques to achieve low noise and high performance. In general, component manufacturers provide a conservative recommendation for power supply decoupling, but in many cases, it is not practical to follow this recommendation because of PCB space availability, power consumption, EMI, or safety requirements. Also, component manufacturers always provide development platforms for designers to evaluate and these platforms typically are a lot larger than the actual design and are not required to be FCC certified, so copying what was done on the development platform is not a guarantee that the design will be successful. This chapter will discuss five important topics for designers: (1) DC resistance of traces; (2) AC impedance; (3) a general rule-of-thumb decoupling method; (4) an analytic decoupling method; and (5) how to make design tradeoffs to achieve the best noise performance possible.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation']"

Their added value compared to hydrographic parameters (e.g., temperature and salinity) relies either on their known rates of radioactive decay and production or on their time-variable releases from sources. Both aspects introduce a temporal dimension that allows quantifying rates or time scales of marine processes. Their wide range of half-lives and historical inputs, together with their physicochemical characteristics allow tracing a broad spectrum of marine processes. This chapter aims at providing an overview of the application of radionuclides as tracers of ocean processes. The chapter is structured in four sections: The first part reviews the main principles of radioactivity and the origin of radionuclides. The second section introduces the key aspects that allow using radionuclides as ocean tracers, followed by (third section) three real and contemporary instructive examples that cover different marine processes and require radionuclides with specific properties: i) thorium-234/uranium-238 ( 234 Th/ 238 U) pair to quantify the biological pump, ii) radium (Ra) isotopes to estimate the magnitude of submarine groundwater discharge, and iii) iodine-129 ( 129 I) to investigate the large-scale ocean circulation.

Together with those of trawlers, the designs of tugs differ fundamentally from all other types of vessels, as their most important performance requirement does not relate to a high cargo capacity or an optimal economical sailing speed, but to the power achievable on the towing hook or the towing winch, known as bollard pull. This is of even higher priority for harbour tugs than for high-sea salvage tugs, which at the same time require a high maximum speed in emergency operations. However, the number of salvage operations has decreased due to the improved technical reliability of ships. Furthermore, governments have stationed emergency tugs off their coasts, after serious accidents with major environmental damage had occurred. At the same time, anchor-handling tugs of the offshore business used as an alternative in salvage and deep-sea tugboats have reduced the employment opportunities of classic salvage tugs, so that their once flourishing business has lost much of its importance and only few newbuildings for these special purposes have been commissioned.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Operations Management']"

To prove this, I shall divide the dissertation in three sections: in the first one, I meditate on the phenomenological framework of feeling, music and history that leads to a tragic experience of time; in the second section, I set out in broad outline how tragedy opposes metaphysics, Christianity and romanticism so as to make comprehensible why man is essentially a weak or rather an insubstantial being that gets his identity beyond the would-be natural or egotistic identity of his; in the third section, I dwell upon some events of the last century that are supposed to symbolise a radical change in the perception of humanity and I choose one of them for the reasons that I give there so as to confirm the precedent approach. This way, the phenomenological exposition provides the indispensable thread to weave the cultural interpretation and vice versa. In a brief colophon, I epitomise the whole conceptual development to emphasise that this is not an exegesis of Nietzsche’s thought (which is moreover obvious in view of the freedom wherewith I move through the initial and the last phases of its development) but an application thereof to the understanding of the present sense of man through the notions of feeling and weakness that I use both in an ontological and a critical sense.","['Philosophy', 'Phenomenology']"

The proteins implicated in amyloid deposition are often intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and are characterized by not folding into a defined globular conformation. The amyloidogenic properties of IDPs are determined by the presence of short sequence elements, referred to as amyloid motifs, that drive ordered aggregation (Thompson MJ, Sievers SA, Karanicolas J et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103(11):4074-8, 2006; Goldschmidt L, Teng PK, Riek R et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 107(8):3487-92, 2010]. The microtubule-associated protein tau adopts amyloid assemblies in over 20 different diseases commonly referred to as tauopathies. However, native tau is aggregation-resistant despite encoding at least three amyloid motifs (Chen D, Drombosky KW, Hou Z et al. Nat Commun 10(1):2493, 2019). Recent cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of tau amyloid fibrils isolated from patient brains showed the involvement of amyloid motifs in the fibril core (Fitzpatrick AWP, Falcon B, He S et al. Nature 547(7662):185–90, 2017; Falcon B, Zhang W, Murzin AG et al. Nature 561(7721):137-40, 2018; Zhang W, Tarutani A, Newell KL et al. Nature 580(7802):283-7, 2020). How does tau change from an aggregation-resistant state to an aggregation-prone state? Consistent with the fibril structures, we hypothesize that tau must change conformation to expose the amyloid motifs that allow self-association into beta-sheet-rich aggregates. This would suggest that the amyloid motifs are likely buried in natively folded tau to prevent self-assembly. We developed an approach that couples cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) with temperature denaturation to probe the loss of contacts as a proxy to measure protein unfolding with sequence resolution. Using this method, we demonstrated that disease-associated mutations in tau located near an amyloid motif disrupt the protective local structure, promote amyloid motif exposure, and thus lead to aggregation (Chen D, Drombosky KW, Hou Z et al. Nat Commun 10(1):2493, 2019). In this chapter, we describe the detailed protocol for this approach. We anticipate that our protocol can be generalized to other IDPs and will help discover critical structural elements to better understand important biological questions including protein aggregation.","['Chemistry', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general', 'Spectroscopy/Spectrometry']"

This chapter will discuss how social workers can and should play an integral role in the holistic delivery of clinical and community care for refugees living with emotional distress and mental health conditions. Methodologies derived from social work are essential for MHPSS programs. In particular, the chapter will discuss the following: (1) how the holistic training of social workers provides practitioners with unique skills to work with people with severe and complex mental health issues; (2) how social work principles provide foundation to MHPSS case management, with examples of their application, using existing process and tools, to refugee response settings in low- and middle-income countries; (3) the significant role of building capacity of social workers to offer focused psychosocial support within an MHPSS system, using scalable psychological interventions; and (4) how clinical approaches to MHPSS must be balanced by empowering approaches that strengthen community participation and agency, explicitly linking this to current and older debates about MHPSS.","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Public Policy', 'Ethics and Values in Social Work']"

A sample of 1109 brand posts from Facebook pages in Lithuania was used. The Random Forest method was used to train models to predict customer engagement behaviour based on features including time frame, content, and media types of brand posts. The data was used for training nine binary classification models using the Random Forest method, which can predict the popularity of a company’s posts. In terms of social score, accuracy of likes, comments, and shares varied from 68.4% (likes on a post) to 84.0% (comments on a post). For emotional responses, accuracy varied from 65.6% (‘wow’ on a post) to 82.5% (‘ha ha’ on a post). The data was collected from one single media platform and country, and encompassed emotional expressions at an early stage on Facebook. The findings of Random Forest prediction models can help organisations to make more efficient solutions for brand posts on Facebook to increase customer engagement. This paper outlines the first steps in creating a predictive engagement score towards diverse types of brand posts on Facebook. The same approach to features of brand posts might be applied to other social media platforms such as Instagram and LinkedIn.","['Business and Management', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Environmental Policy', 'Corporate Environmental Management', 'Environmental Management']"

Imaging three-dimensional tissues and organoids requires a careful understanding of the optical properties of the system and specialized sample preparation. Importantly, these properties have to be fine-tuned based on applications. Ongoing advancements in imaging technologies, particularly light-sheet microscopy, which excels in photo-gentleness and temporal resolution, have enabled researchers to study organ development in toto and have provided valuable insights into mechanisms and regulation of pathways linked to development and disease, among others.

When the ‘Kid from Little Italy’ Meets the ‘Oklahoma Kid’,OriginalPaper,"This chapter focuses on GoodFellas , discussing Martin Scorsese’s conscious attempt to re-create in some of his films what he saw through his window during the most voyeuristic phase of his childhood. Sharing with the audience his first-hand experience not only allows this filmmaker to portray Italian Americanness in an unprecedented realistic way, but often spills over some of his films’ protagonists, turning them into voyeurs as well. As a consequence, this mirroring effect (Scorsese showing his audience his film version of what he saw as a kid), often becomes a double-mirroring effect, because some of his movies’ protagonists represent the director himself. In Mean Streets (discussed in another chapter), the protagonist conducts a symbolic journey within himself through a series of mirrors, but never manages to accomplish a journey beyond himself, remaining stuck within his neighborhood’s insularity. By contrast, GoodFellas ’ protagonist goes from an initial voyeuristic phase to a very active second phase, during which he manages to cross the threshold metaphorically represented by his window and, by so doing, leaves his domestic milieu and moves to the space inhabited by the ‘goodfellas’, ultimately becoming one of them.","['Cultural and Media Studies', 'Screen Studies', 'American Cinema and TV', 'European Cinema and TV', 'Audio-Visual Culture']"

The feats of human creativity and innovation provide our conspecifics too much to marvel at and feel proud of what human civilization has achieved in the course of its evolution down the ages. However, despite all our technological sophistications, we have failed to achieve this glory without compromising the ecological balance of nature. The ecological fallout of anthropogenic activities makes us ponder over the drawbacks inherent in man-made technologies. From this perspective, insects emerge as serious competitors to man because their intriguing evolutionary history is a unique success story which saw their domination in all habitats and resulted in their unprecedented diversity without disturbing the environment and its delicate balance. This is such a remarkable thing that tempts us to learn a lot from insects and come up with novel, environment-friendly, and more efficient technologies. Many branches of life sciences such as genetics, molecular biology, developmental biology, and chronobiology have benefitted so much from the studies on insects that insect models have become indispensable for their growth. Interestingly, insects have been an inspiration behind many of the technological advancements of our contemporary world. The fields of aviation and architecture owe a lot to insects for some of the bizarre designs and out-of-box ideas. Over the past few decades, there has been a significant rise in the application of insects for achieving technological breakthroughs. Materials science is coming forward as a major beneficiary of insect-derived substances with interesting properties which find application in various industries and are appearing in a large variety of useful products. Further, the movement patterns of insects are leading to innovations in robotics and prosthesis. The present review takes a closer look at the uses of insects in the growth of science and technology.

First, extant research shows that top-tiered journals are less likely to accept articles that employ qualitative methods, though interview data are accepted at a higher rate compared to other approaches. Second, as qualitative researchers, we may become a bit “sloppy” or complacent in the presentation of our methods and fail to provide sufficient details about the data analysis. Third, case studies, ethnographies, interviews, archival, sensory, social media, the Internet, and photography, for example, are part and parcel of our current lexicon of research. Under these circumstances, progress demands a certain amount of recognition that may mean using and understanding a different lens of exploration and review. Additionally, we argue that the time has arrived to reject the dichotomy between qualitative and quantitative research. New and standard approaches to research mean accepting and integrating unique and mixed methods that provide richer data. Finally, hoping to support qualitative researchers in the publication process, this chapter examines many of the “dos and don’ts” that should be considered when submitting a qualitative article for peer review.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Research Methods in Criminology', 'Critical Criminology', 'Criminological Theory']"

However, heritage workers generally lack a theoretical understanding of resilience, and there is a dearth of case studies providing objective evidence and examples of good practice in this field. This article argues that an interdisciplinary approach to resilience enables heritage workers to reframe heritage in the larger framework of disaster risk prevention and promoting resilience. It provides an outline of three key terms which form the theoretical basis for this reframing and argues that undesignated heritage recording people’s daily lives (“small heritage”) can play a powerful role in building resilience. It next introduces three case studies from the Japanese triple disaster of 2011 to demonstrate how “small heritage” can promote resilience. The first two examples are cases of psychologists collaborating with historians to provide an appraisal of the psychosocial effects of salvaging “small heritage.” This project not only yields objective evidence that preserving “small heritage” can provide a powerful form of psychosocial support, but it also demonstrates that interdisciplinary collaboration can yield results beyond those possible by either historians or psychologists acting alone. The third case is an example of how the administration of a town affected by the nuclear reactor accident in Fukushima is using salvaging “small heritage” to help the town survive as a community in the face of total evacuation, dispersal of its residents, and discriminatory backlash.","['Business and Management', 'Sustainability Management', 'Social Policy', 'Natural Hazards', 'Climate Change Management and Policy', 'Environmental Law/Policy/Ecojustice']"

We train a control policy in simulation, where we simulate the full dynamics of the system and random external disturbances. We then deploy the trained policy on the real robot. Like recent state-of-the-arts in legged locomotion using RL, our preliminary results show that RL is a promising framework for wheeled-legged robots.

To enhance the efficiency of decision makers using complex data, management science and information technology application is vital. As visualization images are more easily understood than complicated statistical analyses in reports, the interactive and visual analytics system, Tableau, is applied in the big data learning and analytics curriculum. Through feedback it has been found that due to the differing skill levels, some students could not follow the sets outlined in face-to-face learning; therefore, the instructor will offer remedy education using blended learning in the new semester. The two facets of blended learning are face-to-face and online teaching. It is necessary to analyze the behavior portfolios of the learners to intelligently modify the remedy education strategy and enhance the quality of e-learning. During February to June 2021, 39 junior and senior undergraduates in the big data class participated in this study. In the case university, the instructor uploaded the teaching materials in the e-learning platform so that students could check the operational videos after in-class demonstrations. According to the participants’ background variables and e-learning behavior portfolios, descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were performed. The independent variables are gender, group role, login frequency, class attendance frequency, discussion frequency, reading seconds, reading pages, and skill difficulty. The dependent variable is the final report score of the student groups. Hotspot analysis, basic statistics, ANOVA, correlation, and C5 decision tree analyses were performed in this study. The results show that the e-learning teaching materials were beneficial to the students who needed extra assistance after class. Being female, the frequency of login, class attendance, and discussion were significantly positively correlated with the final report scores of the students. The variables of skill difficulty and discussion were the two main variables identified to predict high scores in the curriculum of big data. These findings can help instructors improve their pedagogy and enhance students’ e-learning performance.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Big Data', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering']"

Indeed, one of the principle that manifests itself is the theory of graphs, especially the calculation of the shortest path to optimally reach the data on a few nodes in an architecture of a few hundred nodes or even thousands [ 16 ].

The development of a “networked” society creates demands for digital communication and provides ready access to specialized knowledge and alternative models of practice. For teachers, ICT impacts the nature of their work as well as their ability to access professional development. ICT offers the possibility of ready access to both curricular materials and professional development, increasing the time teachers must spend to stay “current” in their field. ICT also expands teacher access (in communities with sufficient technological infrastructure) to geographically isolated students or communities. ICT also promotes the grassroots sharing of curricular material and can promote communication and group activism among teachers. As a “mass” profession, teachers are in a weaker position than established professions (e.g., medicine) to control the ways in which new technologies shape their work. Globalization, paradoxically, has resulted in a more professionalized role for teachers in a few nations while in general eroding the professional status of teaching in many others. ICT also affects individual teachers’ lives by increasing demands for personal communications with parents and students. Future developments (e.g., AI, social robots, etc.) may further weaken teacher autonomy and shift the teacher’s role to one of communication coordinator.","['Education', 'Teaching and Teacher Education', 'Professional & Vocational Education', 'International and Comparative Education', 'Educational Policy and Politics']"

Because there are currently many more types of nanomaterials being synthesized than there were even 10 years ago, and because more of them are being generated than ever before, more precise and dependable procedures are required to describe them. Nonetheless, such descriptions may sometimes lack specificity. This is due to the inherent difficulties in performing precise studies with nanoscale materials compared to bulk materials. Numerous approaches are used to determine the quality of nanostructured materials that have been created. These techniques include microscopy-based characterizations (scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy), spectroscopy-based characterizations (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, UV–Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy), and X-ray-based techniques (X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray tomography). In addition, thermal methods, centrifugation, chromatography, and electrophoresis techniques have been used. This chapter gives a comprehensive discussion on the use of several nanoparticle characterization techniques (NPs). To get a comprehensive understanding of particles and their characteristics, it is necessary to integrate several characterization techniques. The comprehensive explanations of each strategy, together with the advantages and disadvantages of each, offer us with a greater understanding of how to choose methods that are suitable for the characterization process.","['Materials Science', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nanoscale Science and Technology', 'Materials Science, general', 'Immunology', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Veterinary Microbiology, Parasitology and Infectious Diseases']"

Drawing on the main strategies proposed within Critical Security Studies in relation to the unmaking of security , in turn, I contend that even if the EWL does not use the security frames that feminist neo-abolitionists inside the EU employ, and in fact explicitly rejects them, it still replicates their problematisation of trafficking in women for sexual exploitation as an epiphenomenon of prostitution, which contains within itself the central element that fosters its securitisation at EU level, namely, the neoliberalism–vulnerability–security nexus .

Here, all actors (humans, institutions, AI agents and algorithms) are required to conform to the definition of a player. Models of player behaviour that ‘understand’ the game space provide an application programming interface for typical algorithms, e.g. deep learning neural nets or reinforcement learning agents, to interact with humans and the game space. The definition of ‘player’ is a role designed to maximise protection and benefit for human players during interaction with AI. The concept of benefit maximisation is formally defined as a Rawlsian justice game, played within the AIEd-MMOG to facilitate transparency and trust of the algorithms involved, without requiring algorithm-specific technical solutions to, e.g. ‘peek inside the black box’.

Although various claims of merit have been made, two interconnected issues put these claims into question, and this paper brings some attention to the matter. The first is that the relationship between the structural parameters and the modal features previously considered has been linear and to ensure that the premise was closely realized, only very small damage severities have been considered. The second issue, intimately related to the first, is the fact that the noise, which has been typically taken as small relative to the “change in the features”, is then unrealistically small. In problems where the damage is sufficiently large, the nonlinear dependence of the features on the parameters cannot be generally discarded. It is found that the attainable performance is much less “impressive” that what has been often claimed. The paper also examines the potential merit of using Lp-norm (0 < p < 1) minimization, instead of L1-norm minimization which, to the knowledge of the writers, has not been previously examined in damage characterization research. In this case we also find that, contrary to claims made in other areas, this norm does not lead to any general improvement over the performance attained by minimizing the L1-norm.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

We argue that by striving to make smart devices “self-effacing” and “seamless”, designers are bringing more underlying complexities and dangers for users. We contend the main challenge of designers is not avoiding or disguising frictions but helping users understand them and manage them. Finally, we argue that when balancing the unavoidable trade-offs between privacy and ease of use that seem to be intrinsic to ubiquitous computing, designers cannot continue to rely on legislation but adopt an ethical stance as a critical aspect of their practice.","['Architecture / Design', 'Industrial Design', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Digital/New Media']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-07242-0_9,en,Migrating a Complex Industry to Cloud,OriginalPaper,"Many established industries face a dilemma about Cloud migration, as the ROI (return on investment) of such an effort is not clear. The EDA (electronic design automation) industry’s software, tool methodologies, flows, and scripts for VLSI design have evolved from individual programs on mainframe computers, through collections of tools on engineering workstations, to complete suites of tools with associated methodologies on networks of computers. Design automation is one of the reasons why computer chips with upward of billions of transistors can be designed. One can assert that the server farms that form the back end of the Cloud would not have been around without the EDA industry. Thus, it is interesting to see whether Cloud Computing can, in turn, facilitate future growth of the EDA industry. Based upon a previous categorization of Cloud Computing workloads, this chapter maps the sub-tasks of an example silicon design flow to the types of workloads. The mapping of workloads is applicable to both Private and Public Cloud Computing. This mapping can serve as an example for EDA companies and hardware design firms as they look to explore the Cloud for hardware design tasks. Our method can potentially open new doors and customer bases for enabling EDA growth. This chapter also provides examples of some early adopters, the issues they faced, and new emerging challenges, whether real or perceived. Additionally, some considerations are mentioned, such as licensing and delivery mechanisms that go beyond the mapping of tasks to workloads. The major contribution of this chapter is a proposed method for mapping EDA tools to Cloud Computing categories to facilitate the decision, of which EDA tools are candidates for moving to the Cloud. Such a step is needed to migrate any established industry to adopt Cloud Computing. We wrap up by discussing potential application of block chain to ensure EDA security.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Computer Communication Networks']"

First, we go into the objectives of driving automation, and conclude that, from a safety perspective, attempts to automate driving certainly make sense. However, full automation will not appear in the market overnight, and consumers will be exposed to intermediate levels of automation. We discuss issues with different levels of automation, and what they mean for design. Furthermore, we discuss human factors issues that apply to all levels of automation: how to make sure that people understand and trust the automated system; what needs for shared control may be expected; what may be expected with regards to acquisition and loss of driving skill; what ethical issues may arise and how should these be dealt with; and, finally, do interests of individual customers and society in automated driving converge; if not, how can design contribute towards a solution. Finally, we go into design consequences and opportunities of the fact that automated vehicles will interact with other road users.","['Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Engineering Design']"

However, it is inherently insecure due to its lack of any kind of message authentication. Despite this, CAN is still used extensively in the automotive industry for various electronic control units (ECUs) and sensors which perform critical functions such as engine control. This paper presents a novel methodology for in-vehicle security through fingerprinting of ECUs. The proposed research uses the fingerprints injected in the signal due to material imperfections and semiconductor impurities. By extracting features from the physical CAN signal and using them as inputs for a machine learning algorithm, it is possible to determine the sender ECU of a packet. A high classification accuracy of up to 100.0% is possible when every node on the bus has a sufficiently different channel length.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

All staff members must be proficient in at least one of its working languages, English and French. As in other comparable institutions, however, the reality is that English has become the Court’s lingua franca. What does the dominant role of English mean for the ICC’s ability to further the international criminal justice project? How does the status of English at the Court privilege those professionals for whom it is a native language, as well as the legal framework they bring with them? What kinds of conceptual limitations does dependence on a single language create for an institution aiming to promote what it considers globally applicable principles? Does the ICC’s objective of delivering global justice enable, in fact, the dominance of the contemporary worldwide lingua franca without too much pushback? This chapter, based on a multi-year ethnographic project on how the ICC addresses diverse language challenges, explores the impact of the uneven status of the Court’s working languages on those who work at and with the ICC, as well as on what the Court conveys to the world through the communications of its top officials, its judgments, its outreach activities, and its everyday language choices. It is shown that English-language hegemony is not only entrenched but has detrimental effects for the ICC in both practical and symbolic spheres, rendering the Court less efficient while also undermining its mission as a global institution.","['Law', 'International Criminal Law', 'Public International Law', 'Human Rights', 'Sources and Subjects of International Law, International Organizations']"

Annually, nearly six million tons of this material are released into the environment globally. Most of the tire debris is encrusted to variable extent with other particles, which are derived from brake and road wear, as well as from soil. First emitted into the atmosphere or deposited onto the road surface, these tire-abrasion particles are subsequently transported by wind and water to different environmental compartments, whereby road runoff plays a crucial role in the distribution. Once in the environment, these particles interact with air, light, and water, which triggers degradation and concomitant release of crucial tire components, such as zinc and various organic tire additives. The tire-abrasion particles and the leachates derived from them during their degradation in the environment can cause various biological responses in aquatic and terrestrial biota, as determined by numerous ecotoxicological studies. Challenges exist with the identification and quantification of the abundance of tire-abrasion particles in the various environmental compartments, the determination of their toxicity, and with the reduction of both their emission and immission into the environment.","['Materials Science', 'Materials Science, general', 'Structural Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

They are a very useful tool for deep-sea exploration and reconnaissance missions. AUVs are capable of eliminating wastage of resources and reducing the risk to human life underwater. The construction of a reliable AUV requires a comprehensive system design and a lot of expensive testing at sea where system details can be verified. Modelling and simulation provide a cost-effective measure of the initial design, system: both hardware and software, and mechanical testing and verification, thereby minimizing the number of potential failures in marine tests. Accurate simulation can help developers find hidden errors in embedded AUV software and gain an understanding of AUV performance and capabilities. This project makes an attempt at real-time simulation and dock detection for AUVs so that they can dock underwater and prolong their subsea times. The proposed system utilises the powerful rendering capabilities of Unity along with MATLAB and Tensorflow. The modelling section incorporates the environment and camera features. The simulation component consists of testing the dock detection algorithm using the camera feedback from the AUV.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering']"

Under inflationary conditions, pricing power is even more important for ensuring a company’s lasting success than it is under price stability. Statements by famous investors such as Warren Buffett and Peter Thiel have brought interest in pricing power to the fore. In studies, only about one-third of companies say they have superior pricing power. Regarding price increases, stronger pricing power means that price elasticity is lower and the margin for price increases is widened. Thus, companies with high pricing power will cope much better with inflation than those with low pricing power. The counterpart to pricing power on the customer side is buying power. It plays a major role in industries such as automotive and food and makes it more difficult for manufacturers to implement price increases. Pricing power is created in the long term through superior performance and cannot be created in the short term. Financial power can be used to strengthen pricing power. The involvement of the CEO in the pricing process contributes significantly to strengthening pricing power. The success rate of price increases is higher with CEO involvement.","['Business and Management', 'Business Strategy/Leadership', 'Macroeconomics/Monetary Economics//Financial Economics', 'North American Economics']"

The main problem of this approach is the inability to develop complex systems with original functionality that cannot be implemented by typical Low-Code platforms. The reason for the problem is that the original functionality of complex systems should be based on the logic designed by future users for solving specific problems of the subject area, and not on an empirically constructed methodology implemented in the form of Low-Code systems creation platforms. A new approach to the implementation of intelligent Low-Code platforms is proposed, within which the user is given the opportunity to construct forms of logic for solving problems, and the developer to convert the constructed forms of logic into a methodology for building systems. According to the proposed approach, the structure of the Low-Code platform should have two levels: a) The intellectual level of the user, within which the task of formally designing the forms of logic for solving specific problems of the subject area is solved using formal and applied tools of artificial intelligence; б) The subject level of the developer, at which the latter transforms the forms of logic into a methodology for building systems.

These factors often protect powerful perpetrators from any international scrutiny for mass crimes. The nation-state-building goals of the non-aligned post-colonies shaped TWAIL’s origin. The process of nation-building for postcolonial South-Asian states has often involved fortifying national borders that were arbitrarily and rashly drawn by former imperial powers in the first place. Such fortification involved silencing dissenting minorities through targeted state violence. Likewise, second-generation TWAIL scholarship continues to be constricted by the inapt binary of First World versus Third World. This narrow contextualisation of TWAIL scholarship restricts its lens to interests of Third World nation-states rather than the needs of their people, especially minorities. TWAIL’s foundational goals block effective engagement and articulation of the minorities’ pleas for accountability and remedy in South-Asian countries, creating its own hegemonic narrative.","['Law', 'International Criminal Law', 'Public International Law', 'Human Rights', 'Sources and Subjects of International Law, International Organizations']"

The ten U.S. administrations from the Nixon administration to the Biden administration have implemented different foreign policies, yet they have shared one similarity—they hold a more or less false understanding of the CCP and have unrealistic hope for the CCP, so they believed CCP’s words but downplayed their deeds. The future of global order will largely depend on how the U.S. responds to China’s challenges. The U.S. is relatively declining but it will have a chance to turn it around if the U.S. firmly implements the strategic competition approach.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'International Relations Theory']"

Marcuse’s aesthetic theory is then refracted through the “aesthetic turn” of the late Mark Fisher, as he recognized the productive overlap between his own theory of late capitalism and Marcuse’s in the introduction to his unfinished book-project Acid Communism . Departing from Fisher’s unfortunately only fragmentary elaborations, this chapter attempts to remap Marcuse’s insights into aesthetics and their reception through Fisher onto the problematic of neoliberalism as it has been established in the previous chapter.","['Literature', 'Literary Theory', 'North American Literature']"

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are not well-served by current ERPs, as such systems are hard to tailor. This prompts us to experiment with building an ERP on top of a NoSQL database, which intends to be more flexible, as it is based on JSON and not on a relational data model. We present a novel ERP solution specifically designed to grow and evolve as the world changes. The ERP is for a service company which bills for time spent on customer projects. The work involves various challenges: data modelling, query specification, write and read performance analysis, versioning, user interface generation and query optimisation. Here, we report on the performance of a NoSQL ERP using MongoDB and show that writes are fast and queries and reports are fast enough.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-14630-5_8,en,Riscophrenia: The Risk Fallacy and the Repression of Uncertainty,OriginalPaper,"Contemporary society has elevated the concept of risk to the status of dogma. That this concept may be converted to a mathematical-probabilistic measure supposedly offers security and control over contingencies and random events. Probabilistic risk is part of the current societal obsession with quantification for grasping realities and making forecasts. The disproportionate use of the notion of risk places many different phenomena under the same conceptual umbrella, subjecting them to the reductionist criteria of rule by calculation. I put forward the concept of riscophrenia to describe this tendency. This chapter criticises riscophrenia, that is to say, the inflated use of the notion of risk and the fallacy that chance can be eliminated, knowing that such efforts are inglorious, neglect the prudential principle, and may produce new unpredictabilities and uncertainties. Risk analyses are unable to question the fundamental reasoning embedded in the instrumental vision which permeates modernity. They not only adjust themselves to the model which produces those problems, but also legitimise, justify and ratify it.","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy of Technology', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'History of Technology']"
doi:10.1007/978-1-0716-2695-5_12,en,Probing of Fluorogenic RNA Aptamers via Supramolecular Förster Resonance Energy Transfer with a Universal Fluorescent Nucleobase Analog,OriginalPaper,"Fluorogenic RNA aptamers are synthetic RNAs that have been evolved by in vitro selection methods to bind and light up conditionally fluorescent organic ligands. Compared with other probes for RNA detection, they are less invasive than hybridization-based methods (FISH, molecular beacons) and are considerably smaller than fluorescent protein-recruiting systems (MS2, Pumilio variants). Fluorogenic aptamers have therefore found widespread use as genetically encodable tags for RNA detection in live cells and have also been used in combination with riboswitches to construct versatile metabolite sensors for in vitro use. Their success builds on a fundamental understanding of their three-dimensional structure to explain the mechanisms of ligand interaction and to rationally design functional aptamer devices. In this protocol, we describe a supramolecular FRET-based structure probing method for fluorogenic aptamers that exploits distance- and orientation-dependent energy transfer efficiencies between site-specifically incorporated fluorescent nucleoside analogs and non-covalently bound ligands, exemplified by 4-cyanoindol riboside (4CI) and the DMHBI + -binding RNA aptamer Chili. This method yields structural restraints that bridge the gap between traditional low-resolution secondary structure probing methods and more elaborate high-resolution methods such as X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy.","['Chemistry', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general', 'Biomaterials', 'Biological Techniques']"

Historically, these experiences were only fully appreciated after the completion of the building or urban space. In the past couple of decades, innovation and technology have helped designers have a stronger understanding of how any built spaces would be occupied and experienced through the use of an array of tools and simulations that facilitated performance-driven design pipelines. Nevertheless, there is something very powerful around the idea of placing future users in the experience itself and allowing them to have a preview of how these spaces would look and feel in relation to themselves and their contexts. To that end, the exponential development of augmented and virtual reality (combined referred to as extended reality (XR) environments) has provided the possibility to designers to do exactly that: create virtual environments, often overlayed on the physical space, that allowed architects, engineers, consultants and stakeholders to be able to experience in real-time how these spaces would look like and experiment in real-time with design changes and their effect they could have to the user’s experience (physically and visually). To that end, this paper presents how technology has enabled a large architectural office to facilitate the experiential side of the design prior to the completion of a project, and how this has culminated in the development of a bespoke collaborative XR toolset called Glaucon. Glaucon’s capabilities allow high fidelity virtual designs to be physically situated on the site and to experience it as if it were built. Implementing a collaborative toolset, Glaucon allows physically present and remote users to engage with design as an experience earlier in the process than has been traditionally possible through conventional means, increasing design participation and engagement.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Industrial Design', 'Interaction Design', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction']"

doi:10.1038/s41386-022-01361-x,en,Sustained effects of single doses of classical psychedelics in humans,"['ReviewPaper', 'Review Article']","The serotonergic classical psychedelics include compounds that primarily activate the brain’s serotonin 2 A receptor (5-HT2AR), such as LSD, psilocybin, and DMT (ayahuasca). The acute effects of these compounds are well-known as are their ability to increase the emotional state both in healthy people and in those with neuropsychiatric disorders. In particular psilocybin, the psychoactive constituent in “magic mushrooms”, has shown great potential for treatment of anxiety and depression. A unique and compelling feature of psychedelics is that intake of just a single psychedelic dose is associated with long-lasting effects. This includes effects on personality, e.g., higher openness, and amelioration of depressive symptoms. This review focuses on these stunning effects and summarizes our current knowledge on which behavioral, biochemical, neuroimaging, and electrophysiological data support that the intriguing effects of psychedelics on the human brain and mind are based on neural plasticity. The review also points to so far understudied areas and suggests research questions to be addressed in future studies which potentially can help to understand the intriguing long-term effects after intake of a single (or a few) psychedelic doses.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Psychiatry', 'Neurosciences', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Biological Psychology']"

The application is implemented on the Xiaomi™ MiBand5 band to monitor patient heart rate and other biomedical signals. The data is stored in the Google Fit™ platform and analyzed using a set of rules to detect possible arrhythmia. The application is able to detect arrhythmia thanks to: (a) its synchronization with the wearable device (i.e. smart band) and (b) real-time patient monitoring. Also, the application provides follow-up to patients through a series of alerts and recommendations.
