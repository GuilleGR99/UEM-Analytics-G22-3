doi:10.1007/s42064-022-0144-2,en,A review of dynamic analysis on space solar power station,"['ReviewPaper', 'Review Article']","The concept of a space solar power station (SSPS) was proposed in 1968 as a potential approach for solving the energy crisis. In the past 50 years, several structural concepts have been proposed, but none have been sent into orbit. One of the main challenges of the SSPS is dynamic behavior prediction, which can supply the necessary information for control strategy design. The ultra-large size of the SSPS causes difficulties in its dynamic analysis, such as the ultra-low vibration frequency and large flexibility. In this paper, four approaches for the numerical analysis of the dynamic problems associated with the SSPS are reviewed: the finite element, absolute nodal coordinate, floating frame formulation, and structure-preserving methods. Both the merits and shortcomings of the above four approaches are introduced when they are employed in dynamic problems associated with the SSPS. Synthesizing the merits of the aforementioned four approaches, we believe that embedding the structure-preserving method into finite element software may be an effective way to perform a numerical analysis of the dynamic problems associated with the SSPS.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

High-throughput sequencing was used to examine the response of rhizosphere bacterial communities to heavy-metal stress under single and mixed pollution of cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu). With additions of Cd and Cu, the mean diversity index of rhizosphere bacterial community was in the order Cu alone > Cd-Cu mixtures > Cd alone. In all Cd and Cu treatments, the dominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Acidobacteria. In the additions with different concentrations of Cd-Cu mixtures, LEfSe indicated that there were differences in the predominant species of rhizosphere bacterial communities. Some genera such as Streptomyces and Microbacterium belonging to Actinobacteria as biomarkers were significantly enriched in both control and treatments, while some genera such as Pseudoxanthomonas and Rhodopseudomonas belonging to Proteobacteria as biomarkers were observed to be enriched in the additions with single and mixture of Cd and Cu. According to the Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis, the structure of rhizosphere bacterial community was different between treatments and the CK. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) showed that there were significant differences among treatments ( p < 0.01), and that the addition of Cu might be the primary factor affecting the composition of rhizosphere bacterial communities.","['Environment', 'Soil Science & Conservation', 'Ecology']"

One such technology that is widely used in biomedicine and similar research fields, microfluidics, poses significant benefits for soil research; however, this technology is still underutilized in the field. Microfluidics offers unparalleled opportunities in soil bacterial cultivation, observation, and manipulation when compared to conventional approaches to these tasks. This review focuses on the use of microfluidics for bacteria research and, where possible, pulls from examples in the literature where the technologies were used for soil related research. The review also provides commentary on the use of microfluidics for soil bacteria research and discusses the key challenges researchers face when implementing this technology. We believe that microfluidic chips and their associated auxiliary technologies provide a prime inroad into the future of soil science research.","['Environment', 'Soil Science & Conservation', 'Ecology']"

Among those, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are of concern due to their high environmental persistence, and as they might affect soil structure and function. However, data on impacts of PFAS on soil structure and microbially-driven processes are currently lacking. This study explored the effects of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) at environmental-relevant concentrations on soil health, using a 6-week microcosm experiment. PFAS (even at 0.5 ng g −1 for PFBS) significantly increased litter decomposition, associated with positive effects on β-glucosidase activities. This effect increased with PFAS concentrations. Soil pH was significantly increased, likely as a direct consequence of increased litter decomposition affected by PFAS. Soil respiration was significantly inhibited by PFAS in week 3, while this effect was more variable in week 6. Water-stable aggregates were negatively affected by PFOS, possibly related to microbial shifts. PFAS affected soil bacterial and fungal abundance, but not microbial and certain enzyme activities. Our work highlights the potential effects of PFAS on soil health, and we argue that this substance class could be a factor of environmental change of potentially broad relevance in terrestrial ecosystem functioning.","['Environment', 'Soil Science & Conservation', 'Ecology']"

Determination of changes in soil properties and microbial functional diversity due to land use is needed to establish a basis for remediation of soil pollution. This study aimed to investigate soils contaminated by Pb from different sources and to analyze the functional diversity and metabolism of soil microbial communities using Biolog technology. Pb pollution (>300 mg kg −1 ) significantly influenced the diversity and metabolic functions of soil microbial communities. Specifically, Pb contamination significantly reduced soil microbial biomass carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) levels and catalase activity while increasing invertase activity. Furthermore, Biolog EcoPlate assays revealed that Pb pollution reduced the general activities of soil microorganisms, suppressing their ability to utilize C sources. In Pb-contaminated areas lacking vegetation cover, Shannon, Simpson, and McIntosh diversity indices of soil microorganisms were significantly reduced. The microbial diversity and biomass C and N levels were affected by land use and soil properties, respectively, whereas soil enzyme activity was primarily affected by the interaction between land use and soil properties. Our results provide a reference and a theoretical basis for developing soil quality evaluation and remediation strategies.","['Environment', 'Soil Science & Conservation', 'Ecology']"

However, at present, little is known about the impact of residual chlorine on the soil micro-ecological environment. Herein, we treated an experimental soil-plant-microbiome microcosm system by continuous irrigation with a low concentration of chlorine-containing water, and then analyzed the influence on the soil microbial community using metagenomics. After 14-d continuous chlorine treatment, there were no significant lasting effect on soil microbial community diversity and composition either in the rhizosphere or in bulk soil. Although metabolic functions of the rhizosphere microbial community were affected slightly by continuous chlorine treatment, it recovered to the original status. The abundance of several resistance genes changed by 7 d and recovered by 14 d. According to our results, the chlorine residue resulting from daily disinfection may present a slight long-term effect on plant growth (shoot length and fresh weight) and soil micro-ecology. In general, our study assisted with environmental risk assessments relating to the application ofchlorine-containing disinfectants and minimization of risks to the environment during disease control, such as COVID-19.","['Environment', 'Soil Science & Conservation', 'Ecology']"

However, the influence of fertilizer and weed species richness interaction is unclear. Nematode abundance and biodiversity in wheat and weed plots soil treated with nitrogen, phosphate and potassium fertilizer addition and weed species richness (0, 1, 2 and 4 weed levels) were investigated in a long-term microcosm experiment established in 2010 at Kaifeng, China. The results demonstrated that fertilizer treatment increased the abundance of total nematode, bacterivores, and plant parasites whereas it decreased the total genera number, the Shannon—Wiener diversity index (H′), Margalef richness index (SR), the total maturity index (ΣMI), and structure index (SI), and degraded the structure of the nematode community. In contrast, weed species richness increased these ecological indices and enhanced the structure of the nematode community. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the fertilizer’s effect was more significant than weed species richness. Redundancy analysis (RDA) demonstrated that fertilizer affected soil nematode mainly through increasing soil available phosphorus by 4.71 times and ammonium nitrogen content by 74.03%; weed species richness increased the diversity indices of soil nematode mainly through enhancing soil moisture by 2.07%. Our results suggest weed species richness may relieve the negative effect of fertilizer on the diversity of soil nematode community.","['Environment', 'Soil Science & Conservation', 'Ecology']"

Many SMs are non-ribosomal peptides and polyketides, assembled by non-ribosomal peptides synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) and encoded by biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Despite their ecological importance, little is known about the occurrence and diversity of NRPs and PKs in soil. We extracted NRPS- and PKS-encoding BGCs from 20 publicly available soil and root-associated metagenomes and annotated them using antiSMASH-DB. We found that the overall abundance of NRPSs and PKSs is similar in both environments, however NRPSs and PKSs were significantly clustered between soil and root samples. Moreover, the majority of identified sequences were unique to either soil- or root-associated datasets and had low identity to known BGCs, suggesting their novelty. Overall, this study illuminates the huge untapped diversity of predicted SMs in soil and root microbiomes, and indicates presence of specific SMs, which may play a role in inter- and intra-bacterial interactions in root ecosystems.","['Environment', 'Soil Science & Conservation', 'Ecology']"

A 42-day of microcosm incubation was conducted with two soils: a natural watermelon Fusarium wilt pathogen (i.e., Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (FON))-infested soil (Low-FON soil) and the soil further receiving the wilt pathogen inocula (High-FON soil). Both soils were supplemented with four simple sugars before incubation. The results show that, in both soils, FON was enriched by all sugars although co-living with tremendously diverse microbes; and bacterial richness, evenness, and diversity were decreased and bacterial community structure was changed by all sugars. Bacterial richness and evenness were negatively correlated with FON quantity in both Low-FON and High-FON soils, indicating that FON may tend to live in soil with low alpha-diversity. In both Low-FON and High-FON soils, the sugar-spiked networks had more links, higher density, larger modules, and shorter harmonic geodesic distance, suggesting greater potentials for microbial interaction and niche-sharing. The positive links between some of the keystone taxa and FON indicates that these keystone taxa may have promoted FON. This may be one of reasons why FON could proliferate vigorously after sugar supplementation.","['Environment', 'Soil Science & Conservation', 'Ecology']"

This study aimed to investigate the proteomic response in earthworm exposed to As 3+ . Earthworms were exposed to As 3+ in soil at 5–80 mg kg −1 , and samples were collected after 60 days exposure. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to separate the proteins in earthworm homogenate, then differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified using MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS analysis. After2-DE, 36 DEPs were found and 24 of them were successfully identified. 79.2% of DEPs were upregulated compared to the control group. The maximum fold change reached 53.8 in spot 3108 in the 80 mg kg −1 As group. Two proteins were not found in the control group but found in the As treated groups. Proteins were grouped into metabolism, signal transduction, stress-related, transport, regulation, and predicted/hypothetical protein categories based on their function. The protein—protein interaction between the DEPs indicated that serum albumin (ALB) is very important, related to 6 other proteins. Proteins were then verified by western blot, the results were in agreement with the proteomic analyses. The identification of induced or repressed proteins because of As 3+ in earthworms is helpful to explore the underlying mechanisms of soil arsenic ecotoxicity.","['Environment', 'Soil Science & Conservation', 'Ecology']"
doi:10.1007/s42757-021-0125-3,en,Towards the efficient modelling of trapped air pockets during squeeze flow,"['OriginalPaper', 'Research Article']","In most bonding processes, an adhesive is applied to a substrate in a specific pattern before the second substrate is subsequently pressed against it. During this, the adhesive flows in such a way that, ideally, it completely fills the joint. In practice, however, areas with entrapped air frequently remain in the bonded adhesive layer. Within the scope of a research project, these flows are systematically analyzed in order to identify optimal initial application patterns for the adhesive and substrate geometry to minimise such risks. For this purpose, the authors use an efficient flow model, the partially filled gaps model (PFGM), extended in this study to include the functionality of trapped air pockets. Depending on the volume fractions of air and adhesive, the flow of both phases is computed. Therefore, the model is introduced and fully described, benchmarked with respect to its plausibility and functionality, and results obtained are compared with a CFD calculation. Thereafter, the functionality of openings and closings of the pockets are analyzed. Lastly, the model is then applied to a real scenario created with a Hele–Shaw cell measurement. The benchmark as well as the comparison with the measurement results show the high potential of this technique.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

Our results showed that the selection of different primers and databases influenced the annotation of nematode taxa, but the diversity of nematode community showed consistent pattern among different vegetation types. Our findings emphasize that it is necessary to select appropriate primer and database according to the target taxonomic level. The difference in primers will affect the result of nematode taxa at different classification levels, so sequencing analysis cannot be used for comparison with studies using different primers.

Different computational frameworks and their pros and cons are then reviewed, including the one-equation empirical soot model (macroscale), two-equation semi-empirical soot model (macroscale), different variations of population balance model (mesoscale), discrete element model (microscale), and molecular dynamics model (microscale). It is concluded that the accuracy required and the computational cost available are the two major influencing factors to be considered when selecting the appropriate computational model.

However, the spatial distribution and the activity-density of termites on a fine-scale in tropical forests are still unknown. We checked the spatial distribution patterns of the feeding groups and species of termites and their co-occurrence pattern in a 1-ha (100 m × 100 m) plot, and their correlation with the environmental factors. We used a standard protocol to collect termite assemblages and classified them into five feeding groups based on their preferred diet: fungus growers, litter feeders, soil feeders, soil-wood feeders, and wood feeders. We measured the environmental factors: soil pH, litter mass, aboveground plant biomass, and topographic position index (TPI). Soil-wood feeders showed the highest activity-density, followed by wood feeders, fungus growers, soil feeders, and litter feeders. Soil-wood feeders and fungus growers demonstated a strong correlation while litter feeders showed weak correlations with other feeding groups. Termite feeding groups and most of the termite species displayed a positive association with the high TPI and the low soil pH patches. Our results indicated that the examined environmental factors influenced the termite community assemblages and distribution patterns on a fine-scale in tropical rainforests.","['Environment', 'Soil Science & Conservation', 'Ecology']"

To manage building energy usage and indoor air quality, a model predictive control strategy is proposed and developed. The simulation study demonstrated 18.92% energy saving while maintaining good indoor air quality at the testing site. Two nationwide simulation studies assessed the overall energy saving potential and the impact on the infection probability of the proposed strategy in different climate zones. The results showed 20%–40% energy saving in general while maintaining a predetermined indoor air quality setpoint.

It allows occupants to connect and experience outdoor freshness within a semi-enclosed environment. However, skygardens located on a highrise building may generate intense wind gusts, endangering the safety of occupants. Using a validated computational fluid dynamics model, this study investigates the potential of various vegetative barriers or shelterbelts in attenuating the high wind speeds encountered in such spaces and the impact on wind and thermal comfort. Three skygarden configurations were investigated with and without vegetative barriers, simplified and modelled as porous zones, and their effect was studied on the velocity and temperature profile at the occupants’ level. The results indicate that while hedges and trees can offer resistance to airflow, trees provide higher temperature reduction. However, a combination of vegetative and geometrical barriers provides the most optimal condition in the skygarden. The study has identified the importance of assessing wind attenuation characteristics of tree plantations on highrise skygarden, and the results can be used in designing intervention strategies. Moreover, vegetation can attenuate pollutants and mitigate poor air quality by surface deposition, and future studies should investigate in that direction.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"

Based on experimental results obtained on a simple test structure and corresponding numerical validation using both complex eigenvalue analysis (CEA) and transient dynamic analysis (TDA), this study attempts to propose a new fundamental mechanism for FIVN, which is the repeated cycles of partial detachment and then reattachment of the contact surfaces. Since friction is ubiquitous and FIVN is very common, the insight into FIVN reported in this paper is highly significant and will help establish effective means to control FIVN in engineering and daily life.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

However, the FMP-MR energy dissipation mechanism is not fully understood owing to its disordered grid interpenetrating structure. In this work, computer-aided preparation technology is used to accurately reconstruct the complex spiral network structure of FMP-MR multipoint random contact, and a cell group model with an energy dissipation mechanism is proposed to obtain the dynamic energy distribution of the contact friction in both space and time dimensions. By judging the effective contact point, a global displacement ablation phenomenon of hooked staggered porous materials is induced. The macro- and micro-equivalent frictions are introduced to effectively explain the characteristics of the strong energy dissipation in FMP-MR under fretting excitation. A real and effective damping hysteresis constitutive model is then constructed to dynamically capture the mapping relationship between the complex nonlinear topological structure effect of the materials and spatial random contact dry friction in real time. The results indicate that the contact behavior between turns of the FMP-MR wire follows a clear quasi-Gaussian distribution under an external load, forcing the topological results to change. The energy dissipation of the materials revealed peak energy consumption lagging behind the loading limit for a certain distance, which can be determined by the effective contact point and contact dry friction slip. The consistency between the quasi-static compression tests and constitutive curves of the model was quantitatively verified through residual analysis. The data demonstrated the differential behavior of the FMP-MR meso-structure to follow a phased growth law during loading with different action mechanisms in the guiding, main growth, and relaxation stages of the energy consumption displacement curve. In summary, these findings provide an acceptable theoretical basis for the damping energy consumption mechanism and lifetime prediction of FMP-MR.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

Since the end of the Cold War, watershed events have repeatedly changed the landscape of international cooperation in the health sector. Like other international aid donors, Japan has devised priorities and strategies for ODA based on a set of international and domestic factors in a constantly changing world. Numerous studies on Japan’s ODA have examined international and domestic factors that impact the formulation of the country’s aid policy. This chapter aims to add to those studies by combining recent debates on international cooperation and foreign aid, the right to health, and world health system reforms to explore and analyze Japan’s ODA for health in developing countries. The guiding research questions were as follows: What were the major trends in Japan’s ODA policies in the health sector from 1990 to 2020? Which international health debates and international cooperation factors exerted influence on those trends? What are the prospects of Japan’s ODA given the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts? The research relied on primary sources, specifically Japan’s ODA official documents and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) ODA quantitative databases, as well as secondary sources, such as academic literature on international cooperation and foreign aid for health. Our preliminary findings revealed that Japan’s ODA in the health sector from 1990 to 2020 centered on two main axes: infectious diseases and maternal and child health, both of which are oriented toward strengthening the healthcare system. Given this goal, it seems relevant to consider that Japan’s health system is based on the assumption of the need to provide universal health coverage, a concept currently supported by the World Health Organization (WHO), in contrast to the universal health system, and that the implications of this choice on Japan’s ODA and developing countries’ health policies are yet to be fully understood. The COVID-19 pandemic has put substantial pressure on health systems globally and international cooperation for health; thus, it has the potential to affect and even change Japan’s ODA for the health sector in developing countries.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'International Relations Theory', 'International Relations', 'International Economics', 'Globalization', 'Diplomacy']"

Therefore, primary health-care clinicians play an essential role in providing timely and quality depression care, including the detection, diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and referral of depressed patients. However, depression is usually underdiagnosed and undertreated in primary health care, with structural, organizational, provider, and patient barriers. Several studies have demonstrated that psychosocial, psychological, and pharmacological interventions for depression are feasible and effective in primary health-care settings. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have consistently found that combined interventions, provided in a stepped-care manner, under a team-driven approach, and accompanied by system-level improvements, are the most effective. Although most of the evidence comes from developed countries, packages of low-resource interventions for depression have been proposed for developing nations.","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Health Promotion and Disease Prevention', 'Psychiatry']"

However, within this rapidly expanding field, the role of social workers has often not been sufficiently highlighted. This chapter will discuss how social workers can and should play an integral role in the holistic delivery of clinical and community care for refugees living with emotional distress and mental health conditions. Methodologies derived from social work are essential for MHPSS programs. In particular, the chapter will discuss the following: (1) how the holistic training of social workers provides practitioners with unique skills to work with people with severe and complex mental health issues; (2) how social work principles provide foundation to MHPSS case management, with examples of their application, using existing process and tools, to refugee response settings in low- and middle-income countries; (3) the significant role of building capacity of social workers to offer focused psychosocial support within an MHPSS system, using scalable psychological interventions; and (4) how clinical approaches to MHPSS must be balanced by empowering approaches that strengthen community participation and agency, explicitly linking this to current and older debates about MHPSS.","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Public Policy', 'Ethics and Values in Social Work']"

Expected to be sick at least once in a lifetime, pressuring Malaysians to be literate about their health. It was known to the world of health-related research that this health literacy may help the individuals to competently communicate their health conditions to the healthcare providers, signifying the importance of this study to be conducted. This study applied a cross-sectional study design, was conducted to investigate the relationship between the domains of health literacy which comprised of health care, disease prevention and health promotion towards B40 Kelantanese health communication competence. By using a quota sampling, a total of 100 B40 Kelantanese from Kota Bharu and Bachok districts were approached, and each of the district was represented by 50 respondents. A set of self-administered questionnaires was used during the physical, face to face data collection process. The results from the correlational analysis revealed that there were significant strong positive relationships between domains of health literacy towards the Kota Bharu urban community’s health communication competence, while in Bachok, the strength of the relationships was moderate. Other than that, multiple regression analysis has also shown the opposing findings on the influence of health literacy towards the health communication competence. For Bachok, none of the independent variable can predict the communication competence while for Kota Bharu, the results showed otherwise. Health care and health promotion were the domains that can affect the health communication competence among Kelantanese who live in Kota Bharu, leaving the domain of disease prevention as a non-predictor. Furthermore, a few recommendations have been suggested for the respective District and State Health Departments as well as suggestions for future researchers.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

Evidence-based strategies that surmount the barriers to the provision of mental healthcare are essential to improve the lives of those affected by depression. This chapter provides a review of innovative strategies to diminish the prevention and treatment gap for depression in children, adolescents, and youths. It presents recent evidence related to the feasibility of implementation and efficacy for innovation cases that show promise for building clinical capacity and expanding mental health coverage to improve prevention and treatment for depression: (1) integration of mental health services into primary care; (2) task shifting and training of nonspecialists in mental healthcare; and (3) innovative use of technological platforms to enhance access, cut costs, and reduce stigma. Regardless of the evidence that supports the viability of these models, it is important to test their attainability, agreeableness, utility, and adequacy in different settings, including low- and middle-income countries. In addition, these advances require political support, to be effectively implemented and scaled up to such an extent that they meaningfully affect the burden of disease in children, adolescents, and youths with depression around the world.","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Health Promotion and Disease Prevention', 'Psychiatry']"

For every critical incident of this kind, there are many more police-involved mental health crisis interventions that occur in the community which are successfully de-escalated and safely resolved without the need for police use of force. But by virtue of their circumstances, fatal mental health crisis interventions attract the greater proportion of media attention and public and political scrutiny, and with good reason. Given that the highest calling of police duty is to protect life, it is only appropriate that after a critical incident of this kind consideration is given to whether there was not some other way the situation could have been resolved. Less examined is how these civilian deaths have become something of a marketing opportunity for police technology companies, with large investments made into alternatives to police firearms, based on the assumption that less-lethal tactical options will reduce the number of fatalities and provide a technological ‘fix’ to the perceived crisis in police legitimacy. This chapter addresses the complexities of fatal police-citizen encounters involving mental illness, the ways in which they are typically covered in news media, and the ‘solutions’ that have been sought to prevent the police use of lethal force. The chapter asks what could be done better in relation to mental health crises in the community, examining more recent attempts in Australia to reframe the response as one that should be led by health professionals rather than police.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Crime and Society', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Public Health']"

Despite the implementation of public policies aimed at its formalization in the educational structure, and the promotion of technological development and the digital ecosystem, the new generations have not been actively involved. The incorporation of playful elements has a dynamic effect on literacy processes, promoting the development of skills and competencies that influence learning. Through a systematic review (PRISMA-P) of the scientific literature on health literacy and its relationship with games, this article provides a specific and structured synthesis of the empirical studies published in the last 10 years, identifying contributions and patterns between multidisciplinary contributions, with a particular focus on the combination between gamification and serious games. We concluded that immersion in a playful experience favors the emotional and cognitive learning of the player. The simulated reality of serious games and the gamification of activities can help understand health information, generating direct benefits through risk reduction, adoption of healthy habits and lifestyles.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Health Informatics', 'Statistics, general']"

This chapter will begin with an overview of mental illness and the main links with employment. The self-selection or social drift hypothesis suggests that people with mental illness face higher risks of employment difficulties due to various disadvantages. The social causation hypothesis suggests that certain characteristics of workplaces can trigger or worsen mental illness. The relevance of these explanations depends on the type of mental illness that is being considered. Using common mental disorders, psychotic disorders, and youth mental health as examples, the evidence relating to these arguments is illustrated. Responses to them include anti-stigma campaigns, early intervention for mental illness, supported employment models, workplace awareness, stress alleviation and general well-being programs, occupational health interventions, and policies targeting employment practices. Mental illness and employment are also indirectly linked through their impacts on carers (caregivers), family members, and colleagues. Evidence on these links and responses comes mainly from high-income countries, and a great deal remains unknown in low- and middle-income countries. The COVID-19 pandemic brought further uncertainties regarding macroeconomic recession and new work practices, affecting jobs and employee mental health. This chapter highlights key evidence (and knowledge gaps) on the links between mental illness and various facets of employment to help decision-makers prioritize appropriate actions to the benefit of individuals, employers, wider society, and the national economy.","['Economics', 'Labor Economics', 'Population Economics', 'Human Resource Management', 'Statistics for Business, Management, Economics, Finance, Insurance', 'Education Economics', 'Behavioral/Experimental Economics']"

Only recently have these relations become the object of scientific study. In this chapter, we conducted a nonsystematic, narrative review of the modest but growing empirical literature, which suggests that positive psychological constructs such as life satisfaction, positive affect, purpose/meaning, and optimism are generally predictive of better physical health and functioning. Similarly, religion and spirituality (R/S) variables including religious service attendance, religious/spiritual coping, religious orientation, and prayer have demonstrated relations with better health outcomes. These relations are sometimes complex and possibly influenced by methodological considerations. Several possible pathways to account for these relationships have been proposed, including behavioral processes, social support, and direct physiological pathways. Whether these relations are causal remains a perplexing question to resolve, due to methodological challenges inherent in the nature of the variables themselves and to the practical difficulties of examining these variables via experimental investigation and longitudinal analysis. The possibility that positive psychology constructs may account for associations between R/S and health deserves further exploration, ideally using experimental and prospective longitudinal methods.","['Psychology', 'Positive Psychology', 'Religion and Psychology']"

Current evidence shows promising results on the efficacy of these interventions in youth. However, these interventions are not without limitations and challenges, such as adherence and acceptability issues. In addition, there are currently several gaps in the research and evidence for these interventions, limiting their use and application on a larger scale.

Ageing populations are at particular risk from hazards arising from urbanisation processes, some of which are in turn exacerbated by climate change. One approach for mitigating the negative effects of urbanisation on ageing populations is the leveraging of the beneficial effects of urban green infrastructure as a public health intervention in the planning process. We assessed the potential of available theoretical frameworks to provide the context for such leverage. This involved active engagement with academics and practitioners specialising in ageing, green infrastructure and health and well-being through a knowledge-brokering approach. We concluded that an integrated and comprehensive framework on the socio-cultural-ecological determinants of health is lacking. To address this, we present a set of principles for overcoming challenges to knowledge integration when working at the intersection of green infrastructure, ageing, health and well-being. Our findings—and the co-production process used to generate them—have wider significance for trans-disciplinary research into the benefits of the natural environment to human health and well-being as well as other complex and interconnected topics associated with global grand challenges.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Physical Geography', 'Environmental Management', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

Mental health problems in higher education students have been associated with negative impacts on youth development, poorer academic performance, and higher dropout rates, as well as a negative impact on subsequent functioning in the labor market. Although higher education institutions have developed specific strategies to address the mental health of their students, there is still a significant gap in prevention and early treatment. Moreover, given the high prevalence of mental health problems in higher education students, these institutions are unlikely to have sufficient resources to meet the needs for mental health services. Internet-based interventions may be particularly beneficial in overcoming logistical and financial barriers to health services and hold promise for low-cost interventions with positive outcomes. These interventions allow flexible use of available resources, without time and location constraints, enabling rapid scale-up of prevention and treatment programs, in contrast to face-to-face care. In addition, their relative anonymity and privacy reduce the stigma of receiving treatment for depression.

The argument here maintains an important sociological distinction between the social causation and the social construction of mental health/illness. The socially causation of mental health, focuses on its social epidemiology, so on what kind of social determinants lead to or produce mental health/illness. Whereas the social construction of mental health/illness focuses on how notions of illness, health and care are ‘given meaning’ within and between societies, so on those social determinants that socially define certain people as mentally ill, which, in turn, affects how this group is publicly viewed and treated. Drawing from this sociological distinction, the main claim here is that promoting mental health must accommodate the six ontological features of the human condition identified in Chap. 2 , and in TOWT – these features being, in no prioritised order, human embodiment , finiteness , sociability , cognition , evaluation , and agency . Therefore, when exploring the social causation and social construction of mental health/illness, any epistemological and normative implications for people diagnosed as mentally ill must, in some way, reflect these ontological features. For example, the claim here is that a person who is socially constructed as ‘mentally ill’ should also be viewed publicly as someone who can exercise agency , cognition , and evaluation . That is, with these features underpinning a non-determinist epistemological and normative account of mental health/illness and well-being. The further argument is that this account should be central to the co-productive development of mental health policies and practices (notably concerning the practice of social prescription), so opening-up new ways for viewing and treating those people who are socially constructed as ‘mentally ill’.","['Philosophy', 'Political Philosophy', 'Employee Health and Wellbeing', 'Social Policy', 'Politics of the Welfare State', 'Social Work and Community Development', 'Comparative Social Policy']"

Two potential strategies are briefly outlined: 1. destinations with non-locally specific alpine natural health resources can develop broad tourism experiences for health conditions that occur across society with health a secondary aspect in marketing. 2. destinations featuring locally specific natural health resources with proven evidence can develop offers for a specific condition and are thus able to target a very specific group.","['Business and Management', 'Tourism Management', 'Health Economics', 'Health Informatics']"

Thus, the sustainable development goals (SDGs) reawaken the world alluding to the interweaving connects of health, nutrition, and food safety. This chapter introduces the current scenario of nutrition and food safety and how both traverse important issues in health including the trends of morbidity and mortality as well as the social determinants of health. Furthermore, key elements of nutrition and food safety will be introduced to further explicate how factors and drivers shape and influence food supply including production and access, food safety, and consumer behavior and practices. Finally, we argue how considerable efforts have been made drawing on the current context of changing nutrition and food safety driven by multiple factors embracing externalities, and endogenous factors are being contested and negotiated to make an impact on health equity at a global scale. To further the progress of the SDGs, we conclude with propositions to support international organizations, national government, and local stakeholders to work not in sectoral fragmentation, but together. With the appropriate commitment, investment, and actions at global, regional, and country level, no one will be left behind from attaining good health by reinforcing synergies and trade-offs among SDGs related to nutrition and food safety.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Health Promotion and Disease Prevention', 'Health Policy', 'Social Structure, Social Inequality', 'Research Methodology']"
doi:10.1007/978-981-19-5184-8_1,en,Personal Health Record Data-Driven Integration of Heterogeneous Data,OriginalPaper,"Evidence-based health care is a desired concept today, especially in these pandemic circumstances. However, the patients’ data are deficient, especially for patients with chronic diseases and their previous medical treatments and diagnosis if they must be treated in other institutions outside of the country of leaving or private institutions. All data for patients are stored in the institutional database as electronic health data (EHR), owned by healthcare institutions, hospitals, and medical practitioners. It is almost impossible to integrate such data because of the different low treatment of personal health data, especially when the patients are from different countries. One solution for providing evidence-based health care and medicine is creating a personal health record (PHR) owned and managed securely by the patient as a central point of the PHR data-driven integration of all data connected with the patient that are mostly heterogeneous. All data types for the patient’s health and medical condition can be integrated into cloud-based PHR owned and managed by the patient to provide their data with them where the patient resides. In addition, the lack of information on genetic disorders of patients of which they are not aware can contribute to an increase in the risk of patient death. This fact also leads to the need to integrate medical and health data with various biological and omics data, especially in pandemic circumstances. Although the urgent need for health care and medical data integration is apparent, personal data protection laws are rigorous. They do not allow much progress in the field without implementing healthcare data security and privacy standards. The proposed solution for this issue is establishing a personal health record as an integrative system for the patient applying HL7 (FHIR) standards. The well-known medical codding systems promise future data integrations. In addition, some attempts are made to associate diseases with data obtained from external environmental sensors that measure disease-related data. Using these data, called exposure data or exposome, one can clarify the increasing symptoms of diseases influenced by external factors. In the paper, we highlight a cloud-based system—a model of PHR-based health care that collects different data sources such as EHR, health information systems, and sensor measurement into the PHR. Medical data, PHR, numerous biological and exposome data, and data obtained from sensors, are considered, stored, and managed on the cloud.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Statistics, general', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

Although many older adults experience “successful aging” and positive emotional well-being, biological, psychological, and social factors may favor the development of depressive disorders, one of the frequent and disabling diagnoses of mental health in this age group. The prevention of depressive episodes in older adults is, thus, an important line of action to support their well-being and quality of life. This includes actions at various levels to reduce risk factors and enhance protective ones. This chapter offers a broad perspective of the available findings regarding the prevention and early intervention of depression in older adults. The first section analyzes the consequences and main risk factors of this health concern. The second section covers the general characteristics of the prevention of depression in this age group. The third describes the results of efficacy studies of specific psychosocial preventive programs based on different components (physical exercise, mind-body connection, psychological, and multicomponent approaches), while the fourth and final section comments on the background presented and outlines future challenges.","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Health Promotion and Disease Prevention', 'Psychiatry']"

The model is based on the assumption that ‘subjective age’ is a central variable in retirement decisions that mediates the relationship between working conditions and individuals’ preferred retirement timing. The theoretical model is tested using survey data from a representative sample of older workers in Austria. Based on findings from multivariate regression analyses, we conclude that improved working conditions – directly and via improved health and feelings of youthfulness – can help delaying the timing of labour market exit. Improvements in working conditions would help to extend working life, because workers who enjoy ‘good working conditions’ tend to feel healthier and younger and would be willing to work until a higher age. Job attributes that help workers to maintain a sense of youthfulness and encourage them to stay part of the active work force until a higher age include high intrinsic job quality (e.g. learning and development opportunities at work, task variety) and employee-led time flexibility. Older workers in ‘bad jobs’ that involve physical work strain and time pressure tend to feel older and to prefer an earlier retirement.","['Social Sciences', 'Life course', 'Labor Economics', 'Aging', 'Social Structure, Social Inequality', 'Sociology of Work']"

The early onset of a depressive disorder in childhood and adolescence can negatively influence socio-emotional, cognitive, and academic development as well as school and family functioning. Therefore, interventions to prevent child and adolescent depression are necessary. In this regard, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) implemented in schools can help to fulfill this purpose. This chapter shows that MBIs in schools can effectively reduce risk factors and increase protective factors involved in child and adolescent depression. MBIs aimed at children, adolescents, teachers, and parents are examined considering their mechanisms of action and their effectiveness in preventing child and adolescent depression. The evidence presented in this chapter shows that implementing MBIs in schools for children, adolescents, teachers, and parents individually and separately effectively reduces child and adolescent depression. Also, evidence suggests that implementing MBIs in schools from a community and systemic perspective, involving students, teachers, and parents simultaneously in the intervention, may be more successful in preventing child and adolescent depression. Further research must be conducted on the effectiveness of implementing an MBI in school contexts to reduce child and adolescent depression.","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Health Promotion and Disease Prevention', 'Psychiatry']"

In response, many organizations seek to incorporate capacity building programs into their outreach efforts to help strengthen local health systems. Although leading organizations, like the World Health Organization (WHO), advocate for this approach, uniform guidelines are absent. Methods We performed a systematic review, using search terms pertaining to capacity building guidelines during short-term surgical outreach trips. We extracted information on authorship, guideline development methodology, and guidelines relating to capacity building. Guidelines were classified according to the Global-QUEST framework, which outlines seven domains of capacity building on surgical outreach trips. Guideline development methodology frequencies and domain classifications frequencies were calculated; subsequently, guidelines were aggregated to develop a core guideline for each domain. Results A total of 35 studies were included. Over 200 individual guidelines were extracted, spanning all seven framework domains. Guidelines were most frequently classified into Coordination and Community Impact domains and least frequently into the Finance domain. Less than half (46%) of studies collaborated with local communities to design the guidelines. Instead, guidelines were predominantly developed through author trip experience. Conclusion As short-term surgical trips increase, further work is needed to standardize guidelines, create actionable steps, and promote collaborations in order to promote accountability during short-term surgical outreach trips.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgery', 'Abdominal Surgery', 'Cardiac Surgery', 'General Surgery', 'Thoracic Surgery', 'Vascular Surgery']"

The empirically operationalization is detailed, emphasizing the importance of rigorous psychometric evaluation. Scientific advances of this model of well-being are noted, showing links to sociodemographic factors, experiences in work and family life, and health outcomes. Three future directions for research are considered. The first addresses growing problems of socioeconomic inequality and their role in undermining the opportunities of disadvantaged segments of society to experience eudaimonia. These problems have now been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately impacted those who were already vulnerable. The second new direction examines the role of the arts and humanities as factors that nurture eudaimonic well-being. Whether the arts can activate needed compassion and caring among the privileged is also considered. The third new direction examines the intersection of entrepreneurial studies with eudaimonic well-being. Conventional conceptions of entrepreneurial success focus on business profits; a case is made that eudaimonia, of the entrepreneur as well as his/her employees and surrounding communities, constitute further measure of success that elevate issues of virtue, morality, and ethics.","['Business and Management', 'Organization', 'Industrial and Organizational Psychology', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Philosophy, general', 'Neuropsychology']"

The rapid advances in digital technology make a compelling case to help deliver and implement evidence-based interventions in areas of public mental health provision (i.e., mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment of mental disorders). Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMIs) represent a powerful approach that enables provision of adaptive and personalised intervention components. EMIs build on principles of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and are centred around the dynamics of individuals’ experience and behaviour, and their interaction with contextual factors in daily life. They offer a unique opportunity to deliver personalized interventions that are tailored to what individuals need in a given moment, context, and setting.

Affecting all dimensions of life be it social, economic, or health, this disaster has exposed the socioeconomic inequalities that will adversely impact the existing vulnerable sections of the population based on caste, class, ethnicity, religion, race, disability, and gender. The existing gender inequalities will be exacerbated affecting women the most that stand at the intersection of such ascribed identities. “None of us will see gender parity in our lifetimes, and nor likely will many of our children. That’s the sobering finding of the Global Gender Gap Report 2020, which reveals that gender parity will not be attained for 99.5 years” (WEF, Global gender gap report 2020, Insight report, 2020). Similar disease breakouts in the past have amplified gender implications, and thus the current pandemic will inexplicably affect women and girls. It is against this backdrop that this paper tries to look into the irrevocable impact of the pandemic on women’s health especially reproductive, sexual, and mental health concerns. Postponement and restrictions on essential maternal services, diversion of health resources, mental distress, and limitations of family planning services are some of the major concerns. It is crucial to underline the inherent nexus of health and gender inequality which is being amplified due to Covid-19 and will worsen it further. Thus, the study concludes by outlining the need for proactive inclusive public health responses at the earliest.","['Business and Management', 'Sustainability Management', 'Social Policy', 'Natural Hazards', 'Climate Change Management and Policy', 'Environmental Law/Policy/Ecojustice']"

Accounts of results produced from reinvigorated attention to the measurement, management, and improvement of the outcomes of health care show that much has been learned, and much remains to be done. This article proposes that causes of the failure to replicate in health care the benefits of “lean” methods lie in persistent inattention to measurement fundamentals. These fundamentals must extend beyond mathematical and technical issues to the social, economic, and political processes involved in constituting trustworthy performance measurement systems. Successful “lean” implementations will follow only when duly diligent investments in these fundamentals are undertaken. Absent those investments, average people will not be able to leverage brilliant processes to produce exceptional outcomes, and we will remain stuck with broken processes in which even brilliant people can produce only flawed results. The methodological shift in policy and practice prescribed by the authors of the chapters in this book moves away from prioritizing the objectivity of data in centrally planned and executed statistical modeling, and toward scientific models that prioritize the objectivity of substantive and invariant unit quantities. The chapters in this book describe scientific modeling’s bottom-up, emergent and evolving standards for mass customized comparability. Though the technical aspects of the scientific modeling perspective are well established in health care outcomes measurement, operationalization of the social, economic, and political aspects required for creating new degrees of trust in health care institutions remains at a nascent stage of development.

Considering the demand of remote health care changes, especially in the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to investigate the feasibility of e-Health care within one of the most performed surgery procedures: inguinal hernia repair. Methods A total of 60 patients used the e-Health application in this study compliant. Primary objectives were to investigate the accuracy of the “deviating post-operative course” alerting by the e-Health application. Secondary objectives included patient perspective and e-Health costs analysis. Results Forty-four patients reported no deviation in the post-operative course using the e-Health application of which 93.2% ( n  = 41) was in concordance with the findings during standard follow-up. Within 16 patients reporting a deviating post-operative course, a true complication was found in 25% ( n  = 4). Based on in-hospital costs, a hypothetical e-Health follow-up scenario was more expensive (€59.5 per patient) than current standard follow-up care (€28.2 per patient). Usage of the e-Health application showed a high perceived overall patient satisfaction: 4.2 (on a Likert-scale of 1–5). Conclusion An e-Health application is a promising tool for identifying patients who require in-person or phone follow-up assessment. Patients’ perspectives surveys revealed high potential and willingness of using this application. A hypothetical e-Health follow-up scenario showed to be more expensive compared to current standard follow-up. If the identified (dis)advantages can be improved, e-Health follow-up care appears to be promising in terms of safety and feasibility.

In the first Section on “Working Conditions as Determinants of Retirement”, we summarize studies showing that having a good job is an important aspect of individuals’ retirement decisions. Mostly positive working conditions appear to contribute to individuals’ later retirement, but adverse working conditions not necessarily relate to earlier retirement. Moreover, adverse conditions can be buffered when combined with high job control, job resources or social support. In the Section on “The Health Effect of Retirement”, we focus on how retirement affects health in both theoretical and applied studies, suggesting that the inconclusiveness illustrated in theories is also evident in empirical work. Previous studies, however, vary largely regarding the adopted (1) health outcomes, (2) study designs, (3) definition of retirement and (4) the type of work performed before retirement.

Daher ist es bedeutsam, die psychische Gesundheit in Bestrebungen der Gesundheitsförderung und Prävention in den Blick zu nehmen und unterstützende Maßnahmen zu diskutieren. Da die Schule ein wichtiger Lebens- und Wirkort im Leben junger Menschen ist, kann hier ein wesentlicher Anknüpfungspunkt für Unterstützung verortet werden. In diesem Zusammenhang haben Lehrkräfte als Schlüsselpersonen für Schüler:innen eine besondere Position inne. Um sie bei der Adressierung und Förderung der psychischen Gesundheit ihrer Schüler:innen zu unterstützen, kann auf die mit dem Mental Health Literacy (MHL) Konzept assoziierten Kenntnisse, Fähigkeiten und Einstellungen gesetzt werden. Demzufolge werden in diesem Beitrag die Grundzüge des MHL-Verständnisses, die Relevanz und mögliche Potenziale von MHL bei und für Lehrkräfte dargestellt, sowie auf Erkenntnisse und Lücken der Forschung zu MHL bei Lehrkräften verweisen.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Nursing', 'Physiotherapy', 'Health Care Management', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Speech Pathology']"

The new topic changes the dynamics between the characters of the dialogue: Finite takes over Infinite’s role and becomes the one leading the conversation. The first part of the depiction of the utopia focuses on its health system. Renaissance utopists typically investigate this topic in detail, yet Agostini’s account stands out amongst those of his contemporaries for its length and broad scope—health is, in fact, the aspect of his utopia to which he devotes most of his attention. Agostini articulates his exposition into four main parts that examine: (1) the natural conditions conducive to health (the site and climate of the city), (2) the urban sanitary measures designed to avoid the rising and spreading of diseases (adequate housing, streets cleanliness, population distribution), (3) the lifestyles promoting health (diet and sleep), and (4) the best ways of restoring health (doctors and physicians). However, in his analysis of the utopia’s health system, Agostini keeps reminding, via Infinite, that though human beings should attend to their physical well-being, their greatest priority should be their spiritual health.","['History', 'European History', 'Cultural History', 'History, general', 'History of Philosophy']"

Vision Zero for suicide is an aspiring goal that aims to lower suicide occurrence through a combined action of public health and healthcare sectors. Vision Zero for suicide has a multilevel and multidisciplinary approach that intends to provide a systemic change in society to facilitate and put suicide prevention on the agenda. This chapter explores the origins of Vision Zero for suicide by first presenting theoretical models that influenced suicidal behavior preventive programs. Then, Vision Zero for suicide goals, advantages, challenges, and examples of implementation in some countries will be presented. Further, evidence-based suicide prevention programs in existing public health and healthcare settings will be described as they support the Vision Zero aims.

The subjective nature of the HRQL construct, the cognitive demands of questionnaires, and the necessity of sometimes relying on a proxy report taken together mean that traditional questionnaires scored using classical psychometrics may not provide robust measurement. Advanced psychometric methods, such as those based on Rasch measurement theory, can provide possible solutions to these challenges. Rasch based methods have been used with the DEMQOL/DEMQOL-Proxy disease specific HRQL instrument to measure HRQL in people with dementia, to provide robust scales, to equate self- and proxy-reported instruments, and to create a cross walk from a proxy-reported measurement to the equivalent self-reported measurement. These methods also provide a qualitative understanding of statistical change. Advanced psychometric methods such as those based on Rasch NI Rasch, G. measurement theory therefore provide a potentially powerful way to address the challenges of measuring HRQL for people with dementia. However, the use of these methods is not a quick fix. They require careful development of a conceptual framework describing the construct (HRQL) and a commitment to keeping the person with dementia’s perspective central at all stages of the process.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Health Informatics', 'Psychometrics', 'Health Administration']"

As rates of absenteeism tend to be higher in lower-income areas, this issue has the potential to exacerbate the socioeconomic divide. Specifically in Punjab, Pakistan, government doctors posted to rural health clinics, called Basic Health Units (BHUs), were found to be absent two-thirds of the time. Health inspectors are employed to visit BHUs at least once a month to collect data from a paper-based register located at each BHU and ensure doctors are present. However, absenteeism of the government inspectors causes this system to break down. This case study follows the implementation of the “Monitoring the Monitors” program, which aimed to replace the paper-based record-keeping system with an app-based system that feeds an online dashboard system (for real-time aggregation and presentation of data). Conducting a large-scale randomized controlled trial, inspection rates increased from 25.5% to 51.9% after 6 months. After a year of operation, inspection rates were 33.8% in the treatment districts and 23.5% in control districts. An A/B test was used to measure the effect of a simple flagging system that notified senior health officials when health workers were absent during an inspection and showed an increase in doctor attendance from 23.6% to 41.3%. The government eventually adopted this system (rebranded as HealthWatch), and it is now one of the many apps being used to monitor frontline service providers.","['Environment', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Development Economics', 'Development and Sustainability', 'Engineering Design', 'Social/Human Development Studies']"

While Cosmopolitan tended to follow a script for postfeminist media—full of contradictions, covering serious topics in a tongue-in-cheek way that undermined any gravity, Teen Vogue offered a nuanced portrayal of mental illness that incited its readers to a more critical and engaged interpretation of dominant mental health paradigms. In this sense Cosmo provides an example of profitable vulnerability in that it aligns itself with the trendy themes of depression, anxiety, and other diagnoses, while maintaining a comfortable distance that avoids striking a too somber or heavy tone. Teen Vogue , on the other hand, does offer more spacious definitions of mental illness that does not shy away from difficult conversations.

On average, less acculturated Latinxs consume more nutrient-dense foods including fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; they are also more active than their US counterparts because they use active transportation. Cultural and behavioral patterns of recent immigrants may prove to be protective; these patterns are based on the Latinx values of collectivism, familismo , and personalismo . As generational status in the United States increases, positive health behaviors related to dietary intake and activity diminish. Interventions that reinforce these practices may mitigate the negative effects of the acculturation process by capitalizing on behaviors that are protective against the risk of cancer. Traditional Latinx cultural values can be integrated into public health practice and intervention, preserving traditional Latinx practices that are protective and promote positive health outcomes. The integration of cultural beliefs and values into research studies will increase relevancy for Latinx participants and contribute to compliance and long-term participation for improved population health.","['Biomedicine', 'Cancer Research', 'Social Structure, Social Inequality', 'Public Health', 'Ethnicity, Class, Gender and Crime', 'Health Care Management', 'Latino Culture']"

Safety measures are often described as paternalistic, i.e., as protecting people against their own will. This chapter provides a historical account of such criticism of safety measures, beginning with nineteenth-century opposition to sanitation measures, which were claimed to threaten the freedom to drink dirty water. The historical analysis has a surprising conclusion: Opposition to safety measures does not seem to have much to do with paternalism. Some measures that would typically be described as paternalistic, such as seat belts in commercial aviation and hard hats on construction sites, have met with no significant opposition. In contrast, some of the most vehemently opposed measures, such as speed limits and the prohibition of drunk driving, cannot with any vestige of credibility be described as paternalistic. This is followed by an analysis showing that due to our tendency to follow examples set by others (herd effects), purely self-affecting behavior is much less common than what has usually been assumed. Most of the opposition to safety measures in road traffic seem to result from some individuals’ desires to engage in activities that endanger other people’s lives. The social need to restrain the satisfaction of such desires is obvious.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

Despite documented efficacy among BCS in general, few psychosocial interventions are specifically designed for Hispanic/Latina BCS. With increasing technology use among US Hispanics/Latinos, e-health interventions such as smartphone applications can deliver more easily accessible, scalable, and culturally tailored psychosocial interventions. Two culturally informed smartphone applications for Hispanic/Latina BCS— My Guide (intervention) and My Health (control)—were developed and evaluated. Results demonstrated the feasibility of study procedures and the high acceptability of both applications, which showed improvements in breast cancer well-being and symptom burden over time. A third application— My Guide for Breast Cancer Treatment —was developed to expand the focus of My Guide to Hispanic/Latina women currently in active treatment for breast cancer; a second pilot randomized controlled trial will compare this new application to usual enhanced care. Given the lack of culturally tailored, evidence-based, e-health psychosocial interventions for Hispanic/Latina BCS, My Guide and My Guide for Breast Cancer Treatment may bridge a gap in cancer care, providing needed psychosocial resources to this underrepresented population. E-health supportive and behavioral interventions focused on breast cancer, and its treatment may improve patient engagement as well as patient-reported outcomes among Hispanic/Latina women during active treatment for breast cancer and into survivorship.","['Biomedicine', 'Cancer Research', 'Social Structure, Social Inequality', 'Public Health', 'Ethnicity, Class, Gender and Crime', 'Health Care Management', 'Latino Culture']"

Healthy aging defines the process of developing and maintaining the functional ability that allows well-being in older age. It is based on three cardinal factors for the person: functional ability (i.e., “health-related attributes that enable people to be and to do what they have reason to value”), intrinsic capacity (i.e., the composite of all the physical and mental capacities of an individual), and environment. The maintenance of functional ability represents the common goal of the public health framework. At the same time, the intrinsic capacity model entails an essential shift from a negative to a positive perception of health, quitting obsolete traditional paradigms (i.e., diseases, impairments, disabilities) to the assessment of the individual’s positive attributes (i.e., functions, reserves). In this chapter, a novel approach that the World Health Organization has recently described for promoting healthy aging in our societies is presented. The framework promotes a substantial modification of the health and social care systems that should be redesigned having the individual at the center of a multidisciplinary and multidimensional action.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'General Practice / Family Medicine', 'Geriatrics/Gerontology', 'Public Health', 'Nursing', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Orthopedics']"

We argue that meeting the needs of prisoners with serious mental illnesses forms an increasingly important part of decision-making regarding contemporary prison (re)design. Firstly, we attend to adaptation to understand the complexities of re-designing existing interior spaces within the custodial estate to meet the needs of specific groups. Secondly, we explore the opportunities presented by indeterminacy, as the Unit began operating when so many elements of its design, usage and regime were still unknown. Finally, we elucidate the centrality of forms of accommodation in the re-design of the Unit, involving compromise and negotiation. We conclude that attuning analysis of prison design to the everyday processes and practices that shape much of the custodial estate enables insights to improve the re-design and adaptations of existing prisons.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-11170-9_1,en,Artificial Intelligence for the Future of Medicine,OriginalPaper,"Since its origins, medicine has been more linked to the cure of diseases than to their prevention. This is due to multiple factors, training of health professionals aimed at curing diseases, lack of quality data, processing capacity, poor multidisciplinary approach, etc. However, this paradigm is changing, focusing on maintaining the health of individuals to avoid diseases, improving social welfare. To achieve this, the new approach proposes that medicine must be Preventive, Participatory, Predictive, and Personalized (P4 Medicine). In this chapter, we will analyze how artificial intelligence can convincingly contribute to the construction of P4 Medicine, through the processing of key data such as DNA, electronic medical records and environmental variables to which people have been exposed. Here we can find complex data such as Computed Tomography images, electroencephalograms, free text in electronic medical records, pharmacological data, etc. These data have grown exponentially and efforts to improve their quality are already paying off. However, it is no longer possible for a health professional to analyze them to provide a better diagnosis or carry out preventive work on diseases, requiring the formation of multidisciplinary teams to find new solutions to ancient problems, such as healthcare, where data processing, knowledge extraction and its subsequent parameterization in support systems for medical decision-making are vital to save lives. In this sense, artificial intelligence, together with new methods for processing complex data and computational resources to process massive data, will be key to improving the humanity health.","['Computer Science', 'Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Numerous health and environmental organizations have classified As being the “toxic and dangerous for the environment”. Environmental and food chain contamination by As has been described globally, especially in Asia. Numerous reports have reported high As contents in the groundwater of South-Asian countries, especially India and Bangladesh. According to several reports, globally about > 200 million individuals are at severe risk of As-poisoning due to possible exposure to its toxic levels in drinking water, irrigation water, soil and edible plant tissues. Some recent reports in Pakistan have also revealed As levels > 10 mg/L in groundwater of the country. The groundwater is routinely consumed for drinking in many regions of Pakistan, especially Punjab and Sindh provinces. Hence there is a possibility of severe As-poisoning in different areas of Pakistan containing high As in groundwater. Moreover, soil/crop irrigation by As-containing groundwater has mediated As build-up in soils in different areas of the country and thereby a potential accumulation in food crops. Exposure to As, even at low levels, via any potential source can induce numerous As-mediated health issues, such as cancer. Hence, there is a need to assess the As environmental contamination level in the country. The purpose of this book chapter was to compile recent data regarding As status in groundwater, soils and food crops in Pakistan. The data compiled in this book chapter can be highly useful for future studies and policy making by regulatory authorities.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Earth Sciences, general', 'Geography, general']"

Implementing interventions in schools may overcome barriers to care and serve as a cost-effective means of addressing the unmet mental health needs of anxious youth. The school environment is also a natural setting for anxiety interventions, as many common triggers of anxiety occur in school, such as approaching peers and taking exams. This chapter presents four school-based intervention programs for child and adolescent anxiety: FRIENDS, Cool Kids, Skills for Academic and Social Success, and the School-Based Treatment for Anxiety Research Study. These four programs were selected because their feasibility and transportability have been demonstrated in multiple randomized controlled trials, and there have been significant efforts to investigate whether they can be delivered effectively by school personnel. Following the overview of these programs, various issues, challenges, and future directions related to the implementation of school-based anxiety interventions are discussed.","['Psychology', 'Developmental Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Child and Adolescent Psychiatry']"

Safety measures are often described as paternalistic, i.e., as protecting people against their own will. This chapter provides a historical account of such criticism of safety measures, beginning with nineteenth-century opposition to sanitation measures, which were claimed to threaten the freedom to drink dirty water. The historical analysis has a surprising conclusion: Opposition to safety measures does not seem to have much to do with paternalism. Some measures that would typically be described as paternalistic, such as seat belts in commercial aviation and hard hats on construction sites, have met with no significant opposition. In contrast, some of the most vehemently opposed measures, such as speed limits and the prohibition of drunk driving, cannot with any vestige of credibility be described as paternalistic. This is followed by an analysis showing that due to our tendency to follow examples set by others (herd effects), purely self-affecting behavior is much less common than what has usually been assumed. Most of the opposition to safety measures in road traffic seem to result from some individuals’ desires to engage in activities that endanger other people’s lives. The social need to restrain the satisfaction of such desires is obvious.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

However, the Convention of the Rights of the Child (CRC), which is the most ratified human rights instrument, is dedicated to children’s rights and is unique in specifically referring to the dangers and risks of environmental pollution. This chapter will propose a critical analysis of the normative basis underlying the articulation of environment-related rights Environment-related rights for children. After clarifying the notion of child and the point at which childhood can be said to begin, it will first consider conventional provisions containing explicit references to the environment and then discuss other provisions that indirectly protect environmental aspects of children’s rights.

The journey begins with an examination of the foundation of coverage and benefits. Coverage : through eligibility of Medicare for those >65 years of age, disabled, as well as those with end-stage renal disease and amyotropic lateral sclerosis. Benefits : Medicare alphabet soup provides Parts A–D where A includes hospital, skilled nursing facilities short term, and hospice; B includes provider services; C are the benefits of A + B provided through a managed care organization under Medicare Advantage (MA); and D provides prescription drugs. Whereas Medicaid covers skilled nursing facilities long term as well as the out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses of Medicare. These OOPs can also be covered through Medigap coverage. Care delivery is especially confusing given the changes occurring in shifting from volume to value-based payment models as well as the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Of the three factors – coverage, benefits, and delivery – coverage eligible is the most stable element, while benefits are adjusted annually and delivery is rapidly undergoing change currently. Delivery : while primarily through fee-for-service (FFS) providers, it is shifting to value-based care through growth of MA enrollment but especially with managed care principles being applied within the FFS by at-risk groups such as Accountable Care Organizations and similar delivery models.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'General Practice / Family Medicine', 'Geriatrics/Gerontology', 'Public Health', 'Nursing', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Orthopedics']"

We review current evidence from basic sciences and epidemiology linking stress to the development and progression of metabolic disorders throughout life. Findings from rodents demonstrate that stress can affect features of metabolic dysfunction, such as insulin resistance, glucose and lipid homeostasis, as well as ageing processes such as cellular senescence and telomere length shortening. In human studies, stressors in the home, workplace and neighbourhood are associated with accelerated ageing and metabolic and immune alterations, both directly and indirectly via behavioural risks. The likelihood of developing clinical conditions, such as diabetes mellitus and hepatic steatosis is increased in individuals with adverse childhood experiences or long-term (years) or severe stress at work or in private life. The increased risk of metabolic disorders is often associated with other stress-related conditions, such as mental health disorders, cardiovascular disease and increased susceptibility to infections. Equally, stress can worsen prognosis in metabolic diseases. As favourable modifications in stressors are associated with reductions in incidence of metabolic disorders, further investigation of the therapeutic value of targeting stress in personalized medicine is warranted. Life stress is known to affect the development and progression of metabolic diseases. This Review discusses the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the association between stress and metabolic disease, and evaluates the epidemiological evidence for the influence of stress on metabolic disease. Both animal and human research suggests that stress and related changes in sympathetic–parasympathetic balance and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis can accelerate biological ageing, including unfavourable changes in metabolism and immune function. The adverse impact on metabolic disease risk in adults with a history of childhood adversity is potentiated by mental disorders and behavioural risks and the risk of metabolic disease can be more than twofold higher than in adults without childhood adversity. In adults, stress is associated with a 1.1-fold to 1.4-fold excess risk of obesity, diabetes mellitus and liver disease. The excess risk for mental disorders, such as depression, and cardiovascular disease among individuals with stress in adulthood is slightly higher than that for obesity, diabetes mellitus and liver disease. Life stress is also a prognostic factor in patients, accelerating the transition of metabolic diseases towards multimorbidity, frailty and death.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Endocrinology']"

Vision Zero (VZ) in workplaces presents the challenge to prevent all serious accidents and work-related sickness and disease. Companies and other organizations play a key role, in the development and implementation of VZ, and are supported by international organizations such as the International Labour Organization and the International Social Security Association (ISSA). VZ in workplaces has a long history and several roots, which explain the variety in its application. It is both conceptually and practically closely associated with the development of a broad prevention culture, focusing on the safety, health, and well-being of the workforce as an integrated part of business. VZ in workplaces has developed quickly since the Seoul Declaration (2008), whereby global occupational safety and health leaders and representatives of national governments expressed their will to create a worldwide culture of prevention. In particular, the ISSA launched a global VZ strategy and campaign in 2017, which now (in 2021) runs in more than 80 countries. VZ policies and strategies for both road traffic and workplaces are overlapping and can strengthen each other, as roads are an important place of work in many jobs. The implementation of VZ in workplaces should be regarded as a commitment strategy, based on genuine commitment of both top leaders and all personnel. It is important that VZ in workplaces is understood as a vision and a long-term ambition, not as a target. Proactive leading indicators are therefore more important for VZ than lagging indicators, such as accident frequencies.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

With a record of being the fourth most populous country in the world, Indonesia easily creates a lot of problems in this pandemic situation. This pandemic situation has made the world aware of such problems in their lives. One of the important types of problems that arise from this awareness is the maintenance of physical health. Maintenance of physical health is very important for this pandemic situation. COVID-19 can really cause many diseases, and therefore, health maintenance is very important to get rid of this virus. Many media inform the public to take care of their physical health, but there are also many things that need to be considered and continue life as it is. Therefore, information explaining the importance of maintaining physical health is needed by people in Indonesia, and this study tries to review the importance of health maintenance. This data can be shown in of an app, where it is all currently done digitally, in conjunction also with COVID-19 pandemic that has resulted all people to become digitally literate. In addition, there is also the risk of access to meet other people if you have to consult a doctor, so making a physical health maintenance application during the COVID-19 pandemic will be very helpful. Various educations can be given to the public, such as educating the public that taking supplements/vitamins is important in preventing the COVID-19 virus. Consuming minerals and vitamins for endurance is indeed important during the current pandemic, because the body needs these substances to increase endurance. Apart from supplements, vitamin and mineral needs can also be obtained from various types of food. According to dietitian Maxine Smith, eating healthy foods is the best way to keep the immune system in balance, because the immune system relies heavily on nutritious food. This is because healthy foods contain various substances, including vitamins and minerals as immune support.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Statistics, general']"

Complex associations exist between R/S and mental health, with the preponderance of the research suggesting generally modest, positive effects. The impacts of religious/spiritual involvement, meaning making, religious coping, and spiritual struggles are considered. Following this review, the psychological processes in R/S are examined from the perspective of positive psychology. The interrelated contributions of positive emotion, virtues, and meaning making are identified as essential aspects of R/S that promote well-being and are associated with mental health. Commonalities between religion and spirituality are found in their capacities to evoke positive emotions, support meaning making, and foster the cultivation of virtues. The intersections between secular (positive psychology) and sacred (religious/spiritual) pathways to mental health are highlighted, an integrative conceptual model is proposed, and recommendations for future research are offered.","['Psychology', 'Positive Psychology', 'Religion and Psychology']"

The aspiration principles tell us what level of safety or risk reduction we should aim at or aspire to. Important examples are Vision Zero, continuous improvement, ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable), BAT (best available technology), cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, risk limits, and exposure limits. The error tolerance principles are based on the insight that accidents and mistakes will happen, however much we try to avoid them. We therefore have to minimize the negative effects of failures and unexpected disturbances. Safety principles telling us how to do this include fail-safety, inherent safety, substitution, multiple safety barriers, redundancy, and safety factors. Finally, evidence evaluation principles provide guidance on how to evaluate uncertain evidence.

In adjusted models, patients in highly deprived neighborhoods had significantly lower mean SF-12 physical (44.9 [95% CI, 43.8–46.0] versus 44.9 [95% CI, 43.7–46.1] versus 46.3 [95% CI, 45.3–47.3], p = 0.03) and BREAST-Q psychosocial well-being scores (63.5 [95% CI, 59.32–67.8] versus 69.3 [95% CI, 65.1–73.6] versus 69.7 [95% CI, 66.4-73.1], p = 0.01) relative to moderate- and low-deprivation groups. Conclusions Patients residing in the most deprived neighborhoods were identified to have worse psychological well-being and quality-of-life. The ADI should be incorporated into the shared decision-making process and perioperative counseling to engender value-based and personalized care, especially for vulnerable populations.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery']"

Those who are healthy, can effectively cope with everyday challenges and avail better living standard. This research article aims to highlight the importance of health and the role of media as an important social institution to promote a healthy lifestyle and awareness. The authors highlighted the potential of mass media content to spread health awareness and reinforce healthy behaviours among the audience. For this purpose, Social Marketing is one of the most preferred techniques that can influence public beliefs and attitudes towards personal healthcare. For instance, Social Marketing ads regarding Cancer, HIV and Breast Cancer are an illustrating example of mass media influence to spread awareness and promoting healthy lifestyles. Besides, during the outbreak of EBOLA, Zika, MERS, SARS, Social Marketing also helped to inform the public and as a result, they adopted personal care measures. Thus, the researchers concluded that the role of mass media to promote healthcare is of greater significance. However, besides media, other artificial intelligence should also play their role to provide better health opportunities and improve the living standard by new media.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Business Information Systems']"

During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, everyone was advised to follow physical distancing as a preventive measure. Lockdowns have been imposed, and all of this was very new to everyone. This brought drastic changes in older people’s daily routines, lifestyles, the care and support they receive, their ability to stay socially connected, and how they are perceived. They have received stricter directives on physical distancing as they were one of the first groups encouraged to stay home and are more prone to getting COVID-19 infections. Older people are being challenged by requirements to spend more time at home, lack of physical contact with other family members, friends and colleagues, temporary cessation of employment and other activities, and anxiety and fear of illness and death. The burden of pre-existing noncommunicable diseases or comorbidities, as well as the prevalence of communicable diseases, was exacerbating their situation. The aim of the present study is to determine the impact of social isolation, loneliness, and existing comorbidities on the mental and physical health of the elderly during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic globally.","['Social Sciences', 'Demography', 'Health Psychology', 'Sociology of Family, Youth and Aging', 'Public Health']"

This chapter provides a typology and systematic overview of safety principles and an analysis of how they relate to Vision Zero. Three major categories of safety principles are investigated. The aspiration principles tell us what level of safety or risk reduction we should aim at or aspire to. Important examples are Vision Zero, continuous improvement, ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable), BAT (best available technology), cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, risk limits, and exposure limits. The error tolerance principles are based on the insight that accidents and mistakes will happen, however much we try to avoid them. We therefore have to minimize the negative effects of failures and unexpected disturbances. Safety principles telling us how to do this include fail-safety, inherent safety, substitution, multiple safety barriers, redundancy, and safety factors. Finally, evidence evaluation principles provide guidance on how to evaluate uncertain evidence. Major such principles are the precautionary principle, a reversed burden of proof, and risk neutrality.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

The presence of clinically relevant multidrug-resistant species in food-producing animals may result in human cases of infectious disease. The push towards intensive livestock production systems to meet food demand has increased antimicrobial use in livestock both metaphylactically and prophylactically as growth-promoting agents. Better monitoring, surveillance, and understanding of the consequences of the uninhibited use of antibiotic agents in veterinary are needed to fully determine its potential impact on animal and human health.

Health at birth (e.g., low birth weight) of children born to immigrants deteriorated more than health at birth of children born to Italian natives. The negative effects on immigrants are not equally distributed across ethnicities, but rather are driven by the main economic activity of the ethnic group and its related network at the municipal level. Immigrants whose ethnic group is mainly employed in the sectors most affected during the recession suffered the most.

There is abundant evidence that members of marginalized communities, such as racial and ethnic minorities and sexual and gender minorities, experience higher threats to well-being than members of dominant groups. Such threats include systemic racism and discrimination, bias, sexism, and homophobia, all of which are deeply ingrained in medical culture. Recognizing and responding to these threats requires an understanding of how individual identities influence interactions in the workplace, including evaluations and promotions, team dynamics, and career trajectory. Discrimination and bias are known contributors to adverse outcomes in emotional and physical health, career satisfaction, and social connectedness in the workplace.

We highlight longitudinal evidence indicating that religion/spirituality predict future life satisfaction, but we acknowledge that the size and nature of this relationship can differ between individuals, communities, and countries. We discuss these and other nuances. Next, we explore reasons for the links between religion/spirituality and life satisfaction, including the possibility that religion/spirituality can promote social connection, meaning, hope, coping, and physical health, all of which promote life satisfaction. At the same time, we take a nonreductionistic approach that acknowledges the unique contributions of religion/spirituality to life satisfaction—contributions that cannot fully be explained on the basis of indirect influences.

The physical environment in which jail residents live drastically impacts their daily routines, accessibility to services, and feelings of safety and security. Considering most jails in the United States are binarily sex-segregated and house significantly more men than women, the gendered nature of these facilities is particularly apparent in the purposive design of these facilities. For women, the design of a facility may act as a barrier to getting their needs met because facilities are not constructed to specifically meet their needs which differ in number and types from the needs of men. Using a case study of one jail, this chapter will dissect how the carceral space, layout, and design of the facility makes it challenging to ensure the needs of women are met through connections to educational programming and health services. In this way, architectural decisions are direct reflections of the purposes and goals of a correctional facility (Wener, The environmental psychology of prisons and jails: Creating humane spaces in secure settings , 2012), which in this chapter is argued to be both non-rehabilitative in nature and gendered at its core.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

The implications of extending working life varies for workers in different occupations. The chapter draws on interview data from a qualitative study of 17 men and 20 women workers in the United States. Interviewees working either as teachers or in physically-demanding jobs such as care-giving for older people or cleaning narrated their work-life history and discussed their current work, future plans and their views on working longer. Analysis of different strands of their work-life trajectories – work, family, health – from a life course perspective reveals that workers may be channelled into particular kinds of employment and that advantage or disadvantage can accumulate across the life course. It supports previous research showing that physically-demanding work adversely affects workers’ health. Gendered expectations regarding the provision of care can result in disrupted careers for women, leading to lower pension provision and the need to continue working later. Such processes, combined with pension reforms and the increasingly precarious nature of employment can lead to poor economic and health outcomes for some workers. The implications of these findings for policy are discussed.","['Social Sciences', 'Life course', 'Labor Economics', 'Aging', 'Social Structure, Social Inequality', 'Sociology of Work']"

The deep learning architectures are expected to represent features automatically instead of feature extraction by human labor, and the transfer learning gives an approach to further increase the model generalization ability in different scenarios. First, a few-shot fault diagnosis method using deep belief network and continual learning is introduced to solve the issues that limited monitoring data are available to train the intelligent fault diagnosis model. Second, a method transferring knowledge from the laboratory to the real cases is presented for an extreme condition, i.e., none training data is available. Third, a deep partial transfer learning strategy is provided to promote the success of knowledge transfer when the required diagnosis knowledge is less than that provided. Fourth, when unknown fault condition exists in the testing scenario, instance-level weighted adversarial learning achieves the success of diagnosis knowledge transfer. The methods are demonstrated on diagnosis cases of industrial robots, locomotive bearings, gearboxes, etc. They come up with possible solutions to applications of intelligent fault diagnosis to engineering scenarios with respect to industrial big data.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements']"

Yet, health in terms of a well-functioning body and mind is a crucial precondition for employment. In the workplace, health is inextricably tied to work capacity: What matters is the degree to which health enables or hampers a person to meet given productivity standards. Work in capacity due to health impairments therefore raises deeply normative questions not only for the economy but also for the welfare state. To what extent is incapacity to be tolerated in the productivity-driven world of work, and what is the just and adequate support for people with disabilities who cannot make a living through gainful work? Convention theory offers a number of useful theoretical concepts to analyze these questions, which organize the presentation of EC/SC research on health and employment in this chapter. Handling work incapacity depends on classification: What counts as standard work capacity, or, conversely, as incapacity which legitimizes special treatment? Managing health troubles triggers disputes and requires justifications in the economy and in the welfare system. The (non-)employment of people with health impairments depends on the valorization of labor, which in turn relates to a plurality of quality conventions and respective tests. Finally, dealing with work incapacity is structured by investments in forms that allow classification, valorization, and the coordination of labor market inclusion and support.","['Economics', 'Labor Economics', 'Heterodox Economics', 'Organizational Studies, Economic Sociology']"

These challenges require a robust health monitoring approach to accurately monitor workers’ overall health status. Recent advancements in wearable technologies and physiological sensing have provided ample opportunities towards an objective and continuous in-field measurement of workers’ physical and mental status. However, these solutions have mostly focused on a particular health condition. There is a lack of holistic health monitoring to understand the impacts of the construction environment on workers’ health conditions (i.e., physical fatigue, mental stress, and exposure to heat stress). In this regard, the present study investigates the feasibility of a multimodal wearable sensing system to comprehensively monitor construction workers’ overall health status during their ongoing work. To this end, five able-bodied workers were prompted to perform specific construction activities (e.g., roofing, loading/unloading) with light and medium physical intensity while exposed to varying levels of heat stress (i.e., caution level, and danger level). During each task, three biosignals, namely photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and skin temperature (ST), and were collected from the workers through wearable biosensors. To assess their overall health status, various metrics were extracted from PPG (heart rate, heart rate variability), EDA (electrodermal level), and ST (mean skin temperature).

We begin by identifying what forgiveness and flourishing are. We then move to considering conceptual models as well as evidence supporting the connection between forgiveness and flourishing. An early model of the forgiveness and mental health relationship offers a beginning in this regard. Next, we examine the stress-and-coping models of forgiveness of oneself and others. The final model is the scaffolding self and social systems model of forgiveness and subjective well-being. These models offer multiple vantage points from which to consider the forgiveness-flourishing connection. Limitations to these models and to the current state of knowledge on forgiveness and flourishing are highlighted, especially the limits to comprehensive assessment of flourishing in the extant literature. Conclusions and future directions for studying and promoting flourishing in people of different religious affiliation, cultures, countries, and life-circumstances are discussed in closing.","['Business and Management', 'Organization', 'Industrial and Organizational Psychology', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Philosophy, general', 'Neuropsychology']"

Most organic banned pesticides belong to the insecticides based on chlorinated hydrocarbons, organophosphorus, carbamate, triazine, organotin, and pyrazole(phenyl-) insecticide classes. Notwithstanding the harmful effects of numerous pesticides, their application in agriculture is still practiced in many regions of the world. In this framework, this chapter is a literature review focused on highlighting (i) the role in agriculture and the actually annual production of 15 banned pesticides with high persistence (lindane, dieldrin, aldrin, endosulfan, parathion and parathion-metil, tributyltin oxide, DDT, pentachlorophenol, chlordane, heptachlor, paraquat, carbofuran, fenbutatin oxide, fipronil, and atrazine), (ii) its spreading in soil, water, air, and products, (iii) its toxicity on animals and humans and its fate in the environment compartments, and (iv) the ability of microorganisms to remove these compounds from the environment. Following the analysis of databases on the production, marketing and use have been found that pesticides such as lindane, dieldrin, aldrin, endosulfan, pentachlorophenol, chlordane, and heptachlor are still produced and marketed, even if the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants impose measures to eliminate their production and use. Furthermore, these pesticides are detected in fruits, vegetables, cereals, dairy products, meat products, chicken eggs, and aquatic organisms, thus increasing the risks to human health. For further remediation of the contaminated environments, the potential of microorganisms to biodegrade these substances was analyzed.","['Life Sciences', 'Microbial Ecology', 'Microbiology', 'Environment, general', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology', 'Sustainable Development']"

Centuries of deep-rooted discrimination and patriarchy have resulted in a huge gender power disparity in our society. Historically, the female gender has been constantly discriminated against, for being considered inferior to the male gender. This is a descriptive observational study, with a cross-sectional timeline and knowledge level II. The target population comprises two groups: men and women with degrees in Environmental Health and working in the field. The sampling design adopted was of the non-probabilistic type which employed convenience sampling. To collect the information, a questionnaire was built, using a Likert scale with 5 levels of agreement. Although men had more unequal and penalizing conceptions compared to women, these differences were not statistically significant. Therefore, there was a prevalence of gender stereotypes. This study allowed us to identify, analyze and assess Gender inequalities for Environmental Health Professionals. Most of the results found follow the literature closely and may be relevant to define strategies and programs for future investigations. Our study highlighted evidence of “why” gender equality is so important in terms of Health.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Occupational Medicine/Industrial Medicine', 'Industrial and Organizational Psychology']"

This data has been successfully used in diagnosis and prediction of health outcomes and has the potential to improve health care. However, with data security and accountability as core requirements of medical applications, it remains a major challenge to integrate smart sensing information into the health care systems. One promising application is the integration into expert systems, in which smart sensing information is used to assist medical experts in their decisions. The present chapter aims to introduce expert systems, outline conceptual examples of such a smart sensing enhanced expert system, and summarize the evidence for smart sensing enhanced expert systems in health care. Lastly, the chapter will be concluded by discussing challenges in the field including ethical, privacy and security, and clinical issues followed by an outlook about future directions and developments.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Health Informatics', 'Health Psychology', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction']"

The research was carried out by utilizing the data collected from the experience and knowledge of KII experts, local people and researchers field observations along with by asking the duly semi structured questionnaire with client, consultant, contractor's managers, officers, engineers and the workers. It was identified that mechanical and fall hazards were the most prevailing hazards during construction. Exposures hazards, biological hazards, chemical hazards and psychological hazards were also found at work place. The major cause of accidents was the lack of knowledge and skill along with carelessness of the workers. Other activities like scaffolding works, deep excavation, material transportation, lifting and assembling of towers parts were also found as the equally risky activities during the construction of transmission line. It was responded that the major health problem faced by the workers due to physical hazards was the back pain and wrist pain. Similarly due to chemical hazards most of the workers responded allergic as the main health problem they faced during construction.

Various factors are believed to contribute to this phenomenon, including the intense demands and stress of the job, access to highly potent medications, personality factors, and tendency to self-medicate and/or avoid seeking help. Substance use disorders among physicians can lead to practice impairment, putting patient safety at risk, and can also contribute to significant physical and mental health consequences for the physician (Merlo et al., UpToDate, Wolters Kluwer, 2019). They are associated with both physician burnout and suicidal ideation (Oreskovich et al., Arch Surg 147(2):168–74, 2012). Thus, substance use, and substance use disorders, can be viewed as both consequences of and contributors to physician distress, making the topic a key challenge to physician well-being.

Whilst not formally recognised as a specialist field of practice in Australia, Military Social Work (MilSW) plays an important role in supporting current and ex-serving military personnel and their families. Civilian military social workers are employed in both the Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, and services are provided at micro, mezzo, and macro levels. It is also noted that a smaller percentage of social workers in private practice also provide services to the veteran community. The diverse range of MilSW settings and interventions are outlined in this chapter, and it is highlighted that MilSW predominates in family-sensitive settings, as well as clinical settings, such as in health and mental health. The authors conclude that MilSW is an emerging specialist field of practice that presents the Australian social work profession, university Social Work Departments and academia with opportunities to advance the profession. It is suggested that enhancement of social work education to include MilSW concepts, academic research, policy development, promotion of the unique aspects of MilSW practice, and international collaboration will lead to conditions conducive to establishing the MilSW professional identity in Australia. The authors contend that fore-mentioned actions will assist to advance the profession, and ultimately enhance the MilSW services provided to the military and veteran community, both in Australia and ultimately, across the globe. .","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Military and Defence Studies', 'Social Work', 'Industrial and Organizational Psychology', 'Social Care', 'Social Policy']"

This study further aims to identify the differences in responses between management personnel and construction workers within construction firms. An empirical research approach was adopted using a quantitative method of data collection and data were analysed using IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25. Furthermore, descriptive statistics was used to analyse data and data were interpreted using inferential statistics. Cronbach’s Alpha reliability test was conducted to determine the internal consistency of the constructs. Furthermore, independent t-test was conducted to determine the statistical significance of the means between the groups of respondents. The findings from management and construction workers within construction firm revealed that although there was a small correlation between management commitment and knowledge of H&S legislation, there was no statistical significance between the two constructs. Also, management was not fully committed in applying all the aspects of the construction regulations to improve construction workers wellbeing. The findings revealed that there is a need for more knowledge of H&S legislation and management commitment. The paper proposes measures for managers to engender full compliance and to apply all aspects of the construction regulations such as to; improve knowledge; improve working conditions, consider the health and wellbeing of workers and treat health and safety as a value and not just a priority.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Sustainable Development', 'Construction Management']"

In Bangladesh, yearly 11,700 workers experience fatal injuries and approximately 24,500 die from work related diseases across all sectors. This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of the current occupational health and safety standard/regulations of garments and textile industry workers in Chittagong, Bangladesh. Twenty garments and textile industries were purposely selected having granted permission from their owners to consult workers. The sample size of the research was 200 undertaking 10 respondents randomly selected for interviews from each garment industry. In addition to the experimental group, a sample of 100 participants comprised of teachers and workers from the education sector were interviewed from a control group for this study. Secondary data was used to examine the OHS policies, practices, and action plans in industries. A variety of statistical techniques (weightage analysis, frequency distribution etc.) were applied to analyze the data. The most pronounced health problem as determined from data collection include: the most pronounced health problems included by severity: knees (86%), shoulders (79%), neck (73%), ankles (60%), low back (56%), wrists (54%), right elbow (52%), and hips (33%). The causes of diseases indicated by respondents include heavy workload with prolonging work in a congested and hot humid environment, and not having meals at the appropriate time. Knowledge about workplace policies, OHS awareness and participation in OHS drills has been assessed by the Likert scale method. Apart from experiencing physical health problem, the workers suffer from mental stress, job and social insecurity. Finally, the research offers recommendations to improve OHS in the RMG and textile industry workers including having a worker-friendly environment, improved OHS care facilities, post-accident rehabilitation, and compensation for work injury.","['Engineering', 'Fire Science, Hazard Control, Building Safety', 'Natural Hazards', 'Sustainable Development']"

This population’s workforce Workforce happens to be one of the largest in many parts of Africa, especially when compared to others worldwide (United Nations 2016). In most African countries, the aged population group takes a significant proportion of the total population, making them crucial to the African economy. However, less attention is being paid to this growing population in terms of their current challenges, especially in the aspect of health care. Information derived from the World Health Organization shows that 28–35% of the elderly fall every year globally; leading to injuries Injuries , injury Injuries -related disabilities Disabilities , and death in the aged population (CDC 2014). This paper focuses on shedding light on the health challenges encountered by the older population in several parts of Africa and discusses how these challenges can be combated to enhance their general wellbeing. The approach used in this paper is a literature review from a variety of prestigious journals providing information about various health challenges encountered by the elderly in several countries in Africa. Some of these challenges include falls, mobility loss, vision, and cognitive impairment Impairment . From the information gathered from several literature reviews, it was discovered that the aged population would live better with the aid of technologies that are user-friendly to their specific geolocation. The use of modern technology like assistive Assistive technology and ergonomically Ergonomically designed accessories can all come in handy in serving as a source of assistance to the elderly population not just in African countries but also in several parts of the world. Given the limitations of technology in various parts of Africa, it can be concluded that more research on improving the aged population's quality of life quality using design and technology has to be further explored. This will in turn help to enhance their health and retain them in the workforce Workforce , thus, increasing the economy of Africa as a whole.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-030-76505-7_45,en,Vision Zero in Disease Eradication,OriginalPaper,"The eradication of smallpox – the first and so far only human disease to be eradicated – generated a tremendous amount of excitement and attention to the idea of disease eradication and elimination. In the twentieth century alone, smallpox had claimed the lives of more than 300,000,000 people (Sneed A, Scientific American, https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/who-remember-smallpox/ , 2014). The last natural case occurred in 1977, almost 200 years after the smallpox vaccine was discovered, and in 1979 the World Health Organization declared that the disease had been eradicated (WHO, Smallpox, World Health Organization. World Health Organization. https://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/en/ , 2019c). Most importantly, it demonstrated that eradication was possible; that through the use of science, we could change our future for the better in ways that we had not even dared to think about previously. This achievement also helped to focus attention on clear definitions of disease eradication and elimination. Since then, these definitions have been continuously evolving. In 1993, the International Task Force for Disease Eradication (ITFDE I) defined disease control, elimination, and eradication. With that, they evaluated over 90 potential infectious disease candidates and concluded that six were eradicable. Subsequently in 1997, the Dahlem Workshop focused on the science of eradication and defined a range of public health approaches to infectious diseases from control, to elimination of disease, elimination of infections, eradication, and extinction. Three years later, the second International Task Force for Disease Eradication (ITFDE II) convened in 2000 to review the progress over the past decade. Inspired by these efforts, we reviewed our own experience and interviewed leaders of several disease eradication and elimination campaigns to identify lessons learned from a variety of disease elimination campaigns including smallpox, polio, Guinea worm, and onchocerciasis. Our aim was to identify lessons that might be applied to road traffic injuries. We identified 12 lessons from these infectious disease campaigns: (1) this is a cause and effect Cause-and-effect world; (2) know the truth; (3) coalitions are absolutely essential and absolutely hard; (4) avoid certainty (the Achilles heel of science); (5) measure frequently and build in continuous improvement; (6) respect the culture and work with the people you are trying to help; (7) the best decisions are based on the best science, but the best results, on the best management; (8) the best solutions move us closer to global health equity; (9) do not underestimate the time, resources, or tenacity it will take succeed; (10) eradication does not always require a vaccine or a cure; (11) start in the most difficult places first; and (12) you don’t begin at the end. These concepts from infectious disease campaigns have broader public health applications, and we discuss some of the implications for reducing road traffic injuries.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

Correctional facilities are often places of unrelenting cold, grey environments sited on expanses of lawn or provide no access to the nature at all. This lack of nature in correctional environments is being challenged by criminal justice reform efforts. In this chapter, we provide a framework for designing nature into correctional environments which is grounded in design theories and demonstrated through a series of gardens designed and constructed at the Iowa Correctional Institution for Women. Intentionally transforming the metaphorical and literal grey correctional environment to a green one subsequently holds great promise for the individual physical, emotional, and social health of those who are incarcerated and their lives in the institution and upon return their return to the community. In this chapter we explore what it means to go “from grey to green” and present guidelines on ways in which the biophilic, therapeutic, universal, attention restoration theory, and sensory design principles associated with health-promoting environments can be applied to outdoor prison design as a means to support wellbeing for incarcerated individuals.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

In this context, frailty (i.e., a geriatric condition defined by the age-related reduction of physiological reserves, exposing the individual to an increased vulnerability to exogenous and endogenous stressors) becomes of particular interest. Frailty introduces in the medical nomenclature a way for overcoming the traditional, but obsolete nosological constructs, shifting the clinician’s focus from the concept of “disease” to that of “function.” At the same time, it might provide a way for levering the entire healthcare system toward a more person-centered approach, stimulating multidisciplinary interactions and integration of services. In the present chapter, the concept of frailty is presented in its definition as well as in its clinical and public health relevance.

Due to scarcity in available freshwater resources, ground water turned out to be a key source of water for crop and human consumption. Recently, many groundwater aquifers across the world reported exceeding the limits of the prescribed arsenic level, in turn raising a serious concern on both environment and human health. Arsenic is a ubiquitous metalloid that exists in four different oxidation states inclusive of both metallic and non-metallic characteristics and occurs both in [arsenite (As III ) and arsenate (As V )] and inorganic (monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethyl arsenic acid (DMA)) forms. The arsenite (As III ) form is comparatively more toxic than arsenate (As V ), MMA and DMA. Heavy accumulation of arsenite (As III ) form in the plant tissues stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which in turn affects the membrane stability, permeability, enzyme activity, electron transport chain, and ion homeostasis leading to poor seed germination, growth retardation and yield reduction in plants. In general, arsenite (As III ) form of arsenic predominates in reducing the environment that usually prevails in rice-growing tracts of the world. Rice is the staple food in South East Asian countries viz ., Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Thailand, and Vietnam in turn has a growing concern about arsenic poisoning in the human food chain. In consideration of the associated damage due to arsenic accumulation, many mitigation strategies were devised by several researchers.

The PMS is dependent on new bus connectivity, in particular, by using the TCP/IP protocol as an interior bus rather than on a standard configuration. TCP/IP convention suite can be easily accessed at extremely low costs. Patient control and monitoring is a vital test framework for physiological signals like electrocardiographs (ECGs), breathing rates, invasive and non-invasive circulatory strain, human blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), and body temperature. PMS continuously examines important physiological signs of the patient during individual care. For healthcare personnel, observing every patient for 24 h is a bit difficult job. In hospitals, the importance of PMS is high; hence, the manufacturers of clinical equipment have central patient monitoring and tracking systems. All patient screens are connected to one server-based patient monitoring system in centralized patient monitoring systems.

The number of Hispanic breast cancer survivors is increasing because the US Hispanic population is fast-growing and breast cancer survival is improving. However, this vulnerable population has received little attention. Obesity and weight gain affect Hispanic and African American/Black women disproportionately. Obesity affects several factors relevant to cancer survivorship, including cancer treatment and patient-reported outcomes such as health-related quality of life (QoL). As a first step toward addressing these issues, a pilot study was conducted to assess the feasibility of assembling a cohort of Hispanic breast cancer survivors in New Jersey. Methods were similar to those used in the ongoing Women’s Circle of Health Follow-Up Study, a cohort of African American/Black breast cancer survivors in New Jersey. Hispanic breast cancer survivors were very interested and willing to participate. There were interesting differences in body mass index and central adiposity between Hispanic and African American/Black breast cancer survivors, but both groups had a high prevalence of body fatness and comorbidities. Hispanic breast cancer survivors had lower QoL, particularly obese women.

Starting with how we want our urban areas to be, the chapter examines options to eliminate the systemic risk of deaths and serious injuries on urban roads from three separate but related viewpoints; managing the threats to life and health posed by the energy embedded within the road transport system, the potential for crashes to occur and the exposure of those who use the system to severe injury risk from crashes. In urban settings, it is sometimes possible to eliminate or minimize vehicular traffic on selected roads and streets but, in general, it is either impractical or undesirable to do so. By physically separating vehicles from other vehicles, and from highly vulnerable road users, we risk creating the types of cities and towns that do not support our high level aspirations of highly liveable and healthy societies, with sustainable and equitable urban transport systems. Where physical separation is not viable, it becomes necessary to manage transport system energy to ensure risk remains below the levels we set for Vision Zero outcomes – no one being killed or seriously injured. The main focus of this chapter therefore is on the means by which we can manage kinetic energy, primarily through compatible combinations of infrastructure design and speed limit setting, to protect all who use urban roads. Vehicle technology and structural design are important considerations for system performance as a whole.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

About 1.6% of the global agricultural land area is currently managed by OA practices. In the twentieth century, pioneers such as Rudolf Steiner, Sir Albert Howard, Lady Eve Balfour, Jerome Irving Rodale and Masanobu Fukuoka developed OA systems in reaction to perceived failures of conventional or nonorganic agriculture. Early types of OA included bio-dynamic, natural, biological, ecological and organic-biological agriculture. The International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) provides a definition of modern OA. However, there is no single interpretation of what OA practices and principles entail, and OA production systems continue to evolve. Among common OA practices are fertilization with organic instead of mineral fertilizers, use of natural-derived instead of synthetic plant protection products, and mechanical instead of chemical crop system management. Importantly, OA is the only farming system whose management practices are codified by law in most countries. However, OA is faced with several challenges such as the 19–25% lower crop yield compared to that under conventional or nonorganic practices, the lack of animal and green manure produced on OA farms to satisfy the demand at other OA farms, and lack of plant and animal varieties specifically adapted to OA soil and land-use management practices. Increased efforts are, thus, needed to improve the contribution of OA systems to environmental health as consumer demand for OA products continues to rise globally.","['Life Sciences', 'Agriculture', 'Climate Change', 'Climate Change/Climate Change Impacts', 'Climate Change Management and Policy']"

Since then, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic that has disproportionately infected, hospitalized, and killed ethnic and racial minorities in the United States (Jacobson et al., Am J Prev Med 61(5):644–651, 2021; Moore et al., MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 69:1122–1126, 2020; Shiels et al., Ann Intern Med. https://doi.org/10.7326/m21-2134 , 2021; American Cancer Society, Cancer facts & figures 2021. American Cancer Society, Atlanta, 2021). According to a report of provisional life expectancy estimates from the National Center for Health Statistics, the life expectancy for US Hispanics decreased 3 years (81.8–78.8) between 2019 and 2020. As a result, the life expectancy advantage held by Hispanics over non-Hispanic whites narrowed by 60%, suggesting poorer health and mortality outcomes for the US Hispanic population. It is estimated that 90% of this decline in the life expectancy gap is the result of mortality caused by COVID-19 (Arias et al., Provisional life expectancy estimates for 2020. National Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville, 2021). Some speculate that this disease disparity exists because Hispanics and other underrepresented groups receive the greatest exposure to the virus. They are more likely to live in densely populated areas and multigenerational households; use public transportation; and have essential public-facing jobs in the service and healthcare sectors, where working from home is not an option (American Cancer Society, Cancer facts & figures 2021. American Cancer Society, Atlanta, 2021; Hooper et al., JAMA 323(24):2466–2467, 2020; Balogun et al., JAMA Oncol 6(10):1531–1532, 2020). If infected, they are also more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 because of comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and other chronic conditions (Hooper et al., JAMA 323(24):2466–2467, 2020).","['Biomedicine', 'Cancer Research', 'Social Structure, Social Inequality', 'Public Health', 'Ethnicity, Class, Gender and Crime', 'Health Care Management', 'Latino Culture']"

The goal of food security is to increase food availability for the population, resulting in a healthier and more favourable imbalance between food demand and supply. Recent advances in food technology, plant breeding, and genetic engineering have enabled places around the world to have enough food, resulting in a reduction in undernutrition and the growth of obesity and non-communicable diseases. Because functional foods can help to alleviate these issues, there is a need to produce more of them in order to ensure that they are used more efficiently and equitably as part of a complex and integrated worldwide plan for global functional food security. Thus all national as well as international agencies should collaborate to educate the global food business and governments about the importance of increasing the production of functional foods. Such attempts to buy or produce have not been made in middle-income countries, resulting in an obesity epidemic, which must be addressed across Africa to prevent obesity. Functional Food Security appears to be sufficient to treat all aspects of global malnutrition, including undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight, obesity, and diet-related National Sustainable Development Strategies (NSDS). This chapter contains a comprehensive view of the kinds of functional foods, their utility as a tool to mitigate nutritional deficiencies and achieve the SDG3 of good health and well-being, their use from a global perspective, and their role in the alleviation of food insecurity.","['Chemistry', 'Food Science', 'Food Microbiology', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Diverse identities of gender and sexuality are realised primarily during adolescence, however sex education features sparsely in the curriculum of primary and secondary schools and is prominently influenced by heteronormative and cisgender ideologies. As such, LGBTQ students are at high risk of experiencing social exclusion and being exposed to discriminatory attitudes and victimisation within the school environment and the broader community. The increasing popularity of social networking sites among adolescents and the growing representation of sexual and gender diversity in popular culture over the past decade have enabled novel avenues of relationships and sex education (RSE) for LGBTQ young people. Through a critical review of the literature, we highlight the benefits and challenges of RSE through formal (school) and informal contexts (social media) for LGBTQ students. We identify gaps in the relevant literature and explore suggestions for further research in LGBTQ-inclusive RSE. We conclude the chapter by discussing the practical implications of the extant literature for LGBTQ-inclusive relationship and sex education for policymakers and educators.","['Education', 'Education, general', 'Pedagogic Psychology', 'International and Comparative Education']"

Almost in half of these cases, vision impairment has yet to be addressed or it could have been prevented. It includes people with moderate or severe distance vision impairment or blindness due to cataract (94 million), diabetic retinopathy (3.9 million), glaucoma (7.7 million), corneal opacities (4.2 million), trachoma (two million), or unaddressed refractive error (88.4 million) and near vision impairment due to unaddressed presbyopia (826 million). Ocular health has become a major concern lately due to a significant increase in screen time due to the pandemic which has restricted almost everyone to technological devices for their work, education, and all other basic activities. Blue light emitting from the screen can cause damage to the retina if exposed at high intensity in the visible range (390–600 nm). The damage to the eyes can be controlled or minimized by reducing the oxidative stress on the retinal cells.

It is estimated that in 2018 alone, 24,000 Hispanics were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. Of significant importance is that breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death (16%) among Hispanic women, with over 3000 patients dying in 2018 secondary to this disease. Despite the decrease in breast cancer mortality rates seen in recent years, the magnitude of that decrease among Hispanics is lower compared to the decrease seen among non-Hispanic White women (1.1% per year vs 1.8% per year). Potential contributing factors associated with this phenomenon include the fact that Hispanics are more likely to be diagnosed with more advanced stages and to have tumors with aggressive biology. In addition, sociodemographic factors and difficulty accessing medical care are likely to play an important role. It has been described that Hispanic women are less likely that non-Hispanic Whites to receive appropriate and timely breast cancer treatment. In this chapter, we will review the complexities of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Digitization of the health sector has been on for a long time. The use of smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices is now used extensively. Communication between patients and their doctors has been made much easier and flexible through available mobile applications (app). So, the barrier of distance between patient and doctor has been eliminated. Mobile apps are convenient in clinical diagnosis and evaluation, timely advice, medicine prescription, and the distant monitoring of patients from various areas. The patient can able to share the medical information about the health condition securely through the developed mobile application. By this means, traveling a long distance and visiting the doctor for a regular checkup may be evaded. This chapter stretches a thorough description of a mobile app developed for the virtual patient monitoring system. A novel solution is proposed to monitor the most important health parameters of a patient using wearable sensors and images obtained using medical equipment. The mobile app supports receiving vital parameters such as body temperature, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation level from the wearable sensor node placed in the vicinity of a patient. Hence, developed application assists the doctor in the early prediction of the disease. It can able to analyze a patient’s health status by comparing it with their previous history. Further, the application helps to send alert notifications or short messaging services (SMS) to the patient for emergency physical examination. An elderly patient finds difficulty in visiting clinics for a regular checkup and also finds difficulty in staying in hospital for a longer duration. Thus, proposed and developed mobile application makes it convenient to monitor health status for any patient who are staying with limited access to the medical facility.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Information Storage and Retrieval']"

The infodemic is generated from the excess of information and misinformation that increases exponentially. As a consequence, the infodemic makes it difficult to find reliable sources of information and to obtain information validated by experts in the medical field, which is accessible and understandable to all. One of the strategies used to address this problem is the use of specialized information systems that provide support to reduce disinformation and to disseminate reliable information. In order to address this problem, this paper presents: i) a process model based on filtering by health professionals, structuring by communication professionals and acquisition of customized information based on users preferences, to manage information on the COVID-19 disease for a specific community, ii) the design of a system that implements the proposed process to generate reliable and quality information accessible to the target audience and, iii) the development and preliminary evaluation of the information filtering system on the COVID-19 disease, as a proof of concept that implements some of the main activities of the proposed process. The results of this preliminary evaluation with health professionals are promising, as they provide evidence of the usefulness and ease of use of the system to generate reliable and quality information.

The Internet of medical Things (IoMT) is the focus of the next age of healthcare, based on preventative and predictive analytics. The most impacting sectors of interest in healthcare, behavioral, ambient, and physiological domains, must be monitored on a big scale and in a broad sense. Wearables serve an essential role in data collecting and measurement in customized healthcare monitoring. We want to build a platform that can be customized and adapted to track a wide range of metrics in a comfortable way. However, by incorporating the Internet of things into the health monitoring system, the procedures of health monitoring may be automated, saving the patient valuable time. Furthermore, the cloud, which revolutionized data storage, contributes in the development of a better and more dependable health monitoring system. Real-time storage and visualization of health data is possible. A NodeMCU is utilized as a gateway to gather the user’s health data, and a Raspberry Pi 4 Model broker is used as the central processing unit to analyze all of the data collected in this project. The broker receives and processes health data from the gateway. Using the Google geolocation service, the system is able to monitor the user’s position. The user’s health data and location are shown in real-time on the Thingsboard visualization platform. On the suggested system, many experiments and tests, such as accuracy testing and error analysis, were undertaken, with positive results.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

In this sense, the use of digital tools can open up further opportunities to reconsider value offerings and better access different knowledge resources and relationships within the industry network. This Chapter illustrates the collaborative design approach adopted in HEALPS2 for the development of an ontology-based Decision Support System for health tourism destinations. The resulting ontology aims to model the relationships between the available natural resources, the value offerings and the target groups of NHT destinations. Moreover, the Collaborative Design approach foresees the involvement of end-users (i.e. not only tourism destinations, but also the network of stakeholders, and the actual and potential future tourists) as both sources of knowledge and validators of the ontology and its outputs, aiming to inform decision-making processes in a shared knowledge model that leverages on digital tools.","['Business and Management', 'Tourism Management', 'Health Economics', 'Health Informatics']"

Academic literature on effective treatment approaches for justice-involved young people supports a focus on therapeutic, tailored approaches that build and strengthen positive youth development, social support networks, and commitment to school or work. By establishing the design implications which follow from this evidence, a series of key characteristics emerge that define a best-practice, theoretical facility model: small-scale, locally sited, and integrated with the surrounding community, designed to promote relational and differentiated security, and comprising therapeutic design characteristics. We explored each of the characteristics in three well-regarded European jurisdictions: Spain, Norway, and the Netherlands. Our observations substantiate the theoretical facility model as a valuable tool for drawing into view the tensions, opportunities, strengths, and weaknesses of a design, relative to the facility’s given context. Our findings highlight the importance of carefully considering the design of youth justice facilities in terms of the desired outcomes as they greatly impact upon procedures and ways of working within these facilities, and ultimately impact the outcomes for young people and the community.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

As long as relevant data are gathered, probed, used, and managed in a good fashion, significant improvements in the dependability of healthcare practices are achievable. Nevertheless, unless privacy facets of relevant sensitive data are addressed, there are notable concerns regarding data-driven healthcare policies and applications. In general, technical and engineering facets of such interventions are concentered on to a greater extent, but privacy facets are not adequately addressed. This chapter highlights and discusses privacy issues in data-driven health care. A comprehensive review and distillation of pertinent literature and works yielded relevant results and interpretations. Purposefully, generic privacy issues are elaborated in the beginning. Additionally, areas for improvement regarding privacy issues in data-driven health care are underlined and discussed. People, policy, and technology aspects are also explained and deliberated. Moreover, how privacy is related to people and policy to ensure the success in data-driven healthcare practices is discussed in this chapter. Besides, people’s perceptions about privacy are distilled and reported.

In this paper, we investigate the design decisions and challenges of using deep learning sequential models for predictive health modeling. Our results show that the most successful deep learning health models to date, called transformers, lack a mechanism to analyze the temporal characteristics of health records. To address this gap, we propose and evaluate a new model called DTTHRE: Decoder Transformer for Temporally Embedded Health Records Encoding. DTTHRE analyzes patients’ medical histories, including the elapsed time between visits. We also evaluate the performance of DTTHRE on a real-world medical dataset for two health outcomes: (1) diagnostic and (2) readmission prediction. DTTHRE successfully predicted patients’ final diagnosis (78.54 ± 0.22%) and readmission risk (99.91 ± 0.02%) with improved performance compared to existing deep learning sequential models in the literature. DTTHRE predicts the health outcome for each medical visit, which increases the training examples available from limited medical datasets with no additional training time.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Mathematical Models of Cognitive Processes and Neural Networks']"

Currently, the health and safety procedures in the construction industry are observed to be low in most parts of the world. The impacts of COVID-19 have extensively revealed the lack of preparedness in health and safety procedures in the industry. Even before COVID-19, dengue outbreaks have posed a significant threat to the industry. In such as a context, this study has aimed at identifying the current practices in the construction industry for enhancing the level of health and safety in construction sites for biological hazards and challenges in implementing those practices. The study has drawn on a focus group discussion considering dengue outbreaks in Sri Lanka as a case in point and a systematic literature review that consists of 21 publications on biological hazards in construction sites. According to the findings, current practices can be identified under four groups namely, hazard elimination, engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment (PPE). In implementing these practices, the lack of guidance, inadequate compliance to safety procedures, cost implications, and breakdowns in supply of PPE act as the main challenges. Although some measures are frequently practiced in awake of COVID-19, the long-term run of those measures can pose several consequences. It highlights the need for long-term planning in regard to biological hazard preparedness in construction sites. The paper presents a framework that can be followed in developing a code of practice for biological hazard preparedness of the construction industry. The proposed framework assists policymakers in shaping up the current health and safety procedures into a sustainable stage.","['Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Sustainable Development', 'Building Materials', 'Building Construction and Design']"

It helps reduce the likelihood of accidents and occupational diseases in the workplace. This effect is most relevant for the transport industry. When constructing a risk-oriented evaluation algorithm for noise reduction measures as the most harmful factor in transport enterprises, a risk pyramid is considered. A methodology for studying the values of harmful production factors as a problem with a complex of several output parameters using the normalization method is presented. A method for assessing the probability of risk using the generalized Harrington desirability function is considered. It is based on the method of converting the natural values of the partial output parameters into a dimensionless scale. The selection of measures to reduce the impact of noise was made on the basis of risk analysis according to the pyramid of G.Z. Feinburg. As a result of the study, the proposed noise reduction measures at transport enterprises are evaluated in terms of reducing occupational risk.

At the start the chapter we ask: What are the end-user objects and constructs of PCC – for instance as specified by the profession and in legislation? At the end: What decisions about PCC objects and constructs can be made and how reliable are they? Examples and illustrations from PCC have included (i) neuropsychological cases (dealt with in more detail in the accompanying chapter by Melin and Pendrill (Person centered outcome metrology. Springer, 2022)) and (ii) patient participation. In the two central sections of the chapter, assuring the quality of measurement in PCC has obliged consideration of how traditional metrological concepts – particularly metrological references for comparability via traceability and reliable estimates of uncertainty – need to be extended. In providing an overview of the benefits of combining Rasch measurement theory and quality assurance, the unique properties of Rasch Measurement Theory are exploited to the full. Replacing the instrument at the heart of a traditional measurement system with a human being provides a truly “person-centered” model of the metrology. This in turn enables a viable procedure to establish metrological references in fields such as PCC in the form of “recipes” analogous to certified reference materials or procedures in analytical chemistry and materials science. It also informs the measurement uncertainties which determine the final decisions about PCC taken at the end of the chapter.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Health Informatics', 'Psychometrics', 'Health Administration']"

To this end, an exploratory and descriptive study with a qualitative approach was developed based on the collection and analysis of secondary data. Among the results, seven architectures stood out in the context of Brazilian public health, as well as efforts to develop a flexible and comprehensive software architecture were observed, with less bureaucracy, correction of flaws in real-time, and prioritizing a responsive and resolutive system. This study contributed both to professionals and researchers by providing a document that brings together the existing architectures, highlighting the main points of each one and identifying the existing gaps.","['Social Sciences', 'Science and Technology Studies']"

Although physician well-being challenges have been recognized internationally, this chapter will focus attention on history and culture specific to the organization of US medicine starting in the nineteenth century. It will describe a medical system built on a foundation that stigmatized emotions, reinforced harmful physician ideals, engendered structural inequities, and facilitated public mistrust in physician care. Finally, this chapter will describe how the corporatization of medicine, Internet and social media use, and electronic health records presented new challenges to physician well-being.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Pediatrics']"

This study reviewed the construction accidents court cases in refurbishment and demolition work in Hong Kong from 1990 to 2019 in the legal databases Westlaw Asia and LexisHK. It found that some victims preferred to take risks, indicating low hazard awareness, while others were ignorant and did not know the causes of the accidents even after their injuries. Furthermore, many employers’ hazard awareness is low because they do not aware of hazardous areas. Some supervisors did not instruct their employees to use the protective equipment even though it is provided. As we may some construction sites have already utilised robots with weak artificial intelligence, this article raised a futuristic question regarding the hazard awareness responsibility of autonomous robots with strong artificial intelligence.","['Engineering', 'Fire Science, Hazard Control, Building Safety', 'Building Construction and Design']"

This chapter explores Finnish male metalworkers’ and engineers’ thoughts regarding retirement and prolonging their careers in terms of how men’s motives change as they approach retirement age. Our interviews (conducted in 2010/2011 and 2017) indicated in both groups that the men had lost a great deal of their interest in work and most of them were ready to retire. Rather than focusing on their work ability, both metalworkers and engineers considered it important to secure sufficient health for life in retirement. Quite surprisingly, economic incentives did not seem to play a role in these men’s considerations of retirement in either of the groups, even despite the substantial income differences between them. Instead of additional money, the interviewees thought about their retirement plans in terms of health, mental wellbeing and work-related satisfaction. Our study suggests that future efforts to prolong work careers should therefore focus on improving working conditions and age-friendly work environments.","['Social Sciences', 'Life course', 'Labor Economics', 'Aging', 'Social Structure, Social Inequality', 'Sociology of Work']"

In recent years, hospital information systems (HIS), healthcare software and applications have been introduced to enhance their ability and nurses have a key role in accepting and evaluating the HIS. This study tested psychometric properties and validation of a Persian version of the “Health Information Technology Usability Evaluation Scale” (Health-ITUES). Expert panel, which consisted of 10 nursing professors, assessed the content and face validity of the Persian Health-ITUES. Sample of the was 229 nurses employed in hospitals. Cronbach’s alpha was used to test reliability along with “confirmatory factor analysis” (CFA) was used to test construct validity. Further, both discriminant and convergent validity were assessed. Content validity index (CVI) and content validity ratio (CVR) were .93 and .75 respectively. Scale content validity index (S-CVI) and item content validity index (I-CVI) were more than thresholds (.76 and .90, respectively). Goodness of fit indexes revealed the measurement model was fitted to data well (χ2/DF = 2.49, IFI = .939, CFI = .938, GFI = .903, RMSEA = .076). Cronbach’s alpha values of the factors and total scale were ranged between .75 and .94. The results indicated that Persian version of the health-ITUES is a reliable and valid tool to measure information technology usability in nursing field.

It has become imperative for Saudi Arabia to provide self-empowerment opportunities for its citizens in order to monitor their blood glucose levels. An effective method for monitoring blood glucose levels is using Internet of Things Enabled Continuous Glucose Monitors (IoT-CGM), but there are concerns of adoption as it is heavily reliant on an emerging application of technology. This study proposes an adoption model for IoT-CGMs, which has been named Intention to Adopt IoT-enabled Continuous Glucose Monitors (IAI-CGM). The IAI-CGM is based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and takes three factors into consideration; Practical, Technological, and User Behaviour. The model hypotheses the relationship between the constructs of each of the factors with adoption intention. The model is being developed for the Saudi Arabian population to lay the groundworks for future development. The method by which IAI-CGM framework has been developed is based on identifying the factors of adoption from the literature review. Particularly, TAM, and technology adoption intentions in Saudi Arabia have significant contribution to the development of IAI-CGM. It is expected that using this framework, the readiness for Saudi Arabian T1DM patients to adopt IoT-CGMs can be determined. The study is the first of its kind, and therefore has novel implications for the development of similar frameworks for wearable or attached health monitoring devices for other diseases, and for patients in other regions.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It allows citizens and permanent residents over the age of 18 to participate in sex work, whether as sex workers, buyers of sex or brothel operators, without criminal sanction. Decriminalisation allows brothels to be considered as ‘businesses like any other’, allowing them to be subject to the same laws that govern businesses in other sectors. Decriminalisation in New Zealand establishes the conditions under which sex workers’ wellbeing, safety and sexual health can be facilitated. Because sex work no longer needs to be conducted invisibly, decriminalisation can destabilise the conditions in which sex workers are subject to violence, blackmail and coercion. This chapter looks at how decriminalisation is positioned in contrast to other models of sex work governance, and examines the provisions of the PRA. It sets out the contours of the New Zealand brothel sector and provides an overview of the managed sex industry in New Zealand post-decriminalisation.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime and Society', 'Critical Criminology', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Gender Studies', 'Social Policy', 'Politics of the Welfare State']"

However, technical and economic reasons may prevent the deployment of pervasive sensor networks over civil structures, thus limiting their reliability in terms of damage detection. Moreover, the effects of environmental (and operational) variability may lead to false alarms. To address these challenges, a multi-stage machine learning (ML) method is here proposed by exploiting autoregressive (AR) spectra as damage-sensitive features. The proposed method is framed as follows: (i) computing the distances between different sets of the AR spectra via the log-spectral distance (LSD), providing also the training and test datasets; (ii) removing the potential environmental variability by an auto-associative artificial neural network (AANN), to set normalized training and test datasets; (iii) running a statistical analysis via the Mahalanobis-squared distance (MSD) for early damage detection. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is assessed in the case of limited vibration data for the laboratory truss structure known as the Wooden Bridge. Comparative studies show that the AR spectrum is a reliable feature, sensitive to damage even in the presence of a limited number of sensors in the network; additionally, the multi-stage ML methodology succeeds in early detecting damage under environmental variability.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Evolution and Trends of Architectures for Health,OriginalPaper,"Access to healthcare is deeply conditioned by several social factors such as health policies and economic conditions but, undoubtedly, hospitals are recognized worldwide as the symbol of the healthcare system in its maximum complexity and they are services that will never decay. Since their origins, they represent the social community and, in the socio-cultural context, the original values of interdependence and solidarity. They embody the permeability and availability of entertainment and cultural activities in order to respond to the community’s needs. Starting from the evolution of hospital design, currently healthcare facilities are spaces for care but they also host research and education areas, workplaces, public spaces, etc. As healing places, they require specific considerations in the project design to mitigate the sense of isolation and disorientation, to ease concerns and promote health. As the Scientific Community highlighted, nowadays the quality of spaces plays a key-role in the medical processes, contributing both to improve the experience and comfort perceived by users and to improve the efficiency of staff. For this reason, hospital planners and stakeholders are called to act and to give rise to user-centred system in terms of comfort, efficiency, organizational and operational effectiveness, with an evidence based design approach. Therefore, the scope of this contribution is to argue the evolution of these architectures and to pinpoint the current trends of healthcare design regarding different fields of interest such as building typologies and functional layouts, sustainability, flexibility, soft qualities, innovative materials and the relationship with green.","['Business and Management', 'Employee Health and Wellbeing', 'Business and Management, general', 'Urban Studies/Sociology', 'Public Health']"

Saaremaa, the largest island and the epicenter of the virus, was isolated. A 2 billion-euro aid program was launched, including labor market support, sickness benefits, and tax incentives. Adjustment to the emergency situation was alleviated by Estonia’s advanced digital society. Levels of public compliance with the restrictions were, in general, high. While the government’s handling of the crisis is considered successful overall, the emergency situation facilitated the concentration of power in the hands of the executive. In a situation where normal parliamentary and societal debate were hampered, the government pushed through legislative proposals concerning migration, environment, and social affairs that extended beyond the immediate needs of the pandemic and that undermined democratic values.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Comparative Politics']"

Most of the data analyses were carried out on results obtained from AAS. The XRF analysis was performed for comparison and it turned out to be a useful tool in this study. Both the AAS and XRF analyses indicated that the soil from the oil site farms contained the greatest concentrations of all elements measured. The pollution load index (PLI) for Fe and Ni was greater than 1 (1.92 and 1.33, respectively), indicating that the soils were contaminated with heavy metals. The pollution concentration factor (PCF) indices for Mn, Ni, and Pb were high for the tuberous crops, while maize was the only crop that had the highest PCF index for Zn from all three farmlands. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) confirmed significant differences ( p  < 0.001) between the metals and soil. From the Dietary Intake Requirement (DIR) calculations, the annual dietary intakes of Fe, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, and Pb were as high as 255, 195, 137, 150, 71, and 87 (mg/person/year), respectively. These can bioaccumulate in the tissues and organs thus posing health risks to the consumers. White yam had the highest concentrations of these metals and they are in the following order White yam > cassava > three-leaved yam > water yam > maize. Cr, Co, Cu, Cd, and Pb were not detected in the harvested cassava at 18 months. It is therefore recommended that cassava should be harvested at 18 months and processed for consumption. The levels of these metals and others should be monitored regularly by agricultural regulatory agencies.","['Chemistry', 'Food Science', 'Agriculture']"

However, their adoption and scaling have consistently been unsatisfactory and sometimes, outright disappointing. Scholars have offered several valuable, insightful, and pertinent contributions to address the above challenge. However, these contributions are in most cases atomistic, transitory, non-spatial, and dispersed. The above state of affairs has left practitioners in limbo as to where and when to apply which insights to what type of digital health intervention and in which context. In this article, a new holistic and integrated theoretical framework, specifically focusing on remote patients’ health management tools and systems (RPMTSs) used to engage patients and potential patients at distance or away from healthcare facilities is proposed and introduced to address the above existing fragmentation and gaps. The new framework demonstrates how a clear and holistic understanding of “adoption” and “scaling” processes in the context of a given type and nature of digital health intervention along with an adaptive complex, processual and systems thinking approach can help confront the complexity of the healthcare apparatus while at the same time responding to its constantly evolving, dynamic nature with “agents” who may sometimes act irrationally or behave in unpredictable ways. In the process, a new framework is added to the knowledge base to guide and support the adoption and scaling of RPMTSs.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Strain measurements are utilized in this direction via FBG sensors bonded to the stiffener feet. The strain data collected during the fatigue life are processed and used for the RUL prognosis. In order to accomplish this task, it is essential to produce Health Indicators (HIs) out of raw strain that can properly capture the degradation process. To create such HIs a new pre/post-processing technique is employed and a variety of different HIs are developed. The quality of the HIs can enhance the performance of the prognostic algorithms, hence a fusion methodology is proposed using genetic algorithms. The resulted fused HI is used for the RUL estimation of the SSCPs. Gaussian processes and Hidden Semi Markov Models are employed for RUL prognosis and their performance is compared. Despite the complexity the raw data we demonstrate the feasibility of successful RUL prognostics in a SHM-data driven approach.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Smartphones‚ in particular, stand out as being an ideal self-tracking technology that permits both active logging (via self-reports) and passive tracking of information (via phone logs and mobile sensors). In this chapter, we present the results of a literature review of smartphone-based personal informatics studies across three different disciplinary databases (computer science, psychology, and communication). In doing so, we propose a conceptual framework for organizing the smartphone-based personal informatics literature. Our framework situates self-tracking studies based on their substantive focus across two domains: (1) the measurement domain (whether the study uses subjective or objective data) and (2) the outcome of interest domain (whether the study aims to promote insight or change in physical and/or mental characteristics). We use this framework to identify and discuss research trends and gaps in the literature. For example, most research has been concentrated on tracking of objective measurements to change either physical or mental characteristics, while less research used subjective measures to study a physical outcome of interest. We conclude by pointing to promising future directions for research on self-tracking and personal informatics and emphasize the need for a greater appreciation of individual differences in future self-tracking research.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Health Informatics', 'Health Psychology', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction']"

As the workplace, operation content, operation time, operation frequency and operators of metro operation and maintenance posts are determined according to the actual needs, the type, concentration or intensity, number of people, time and frequency of occupational hazards factors exposed are uncertain, and the risk is in a gray state, so it is difficult to evaluate their occupational health risk by quantitative evaluation method. Therefore, this paper takes a maintenance operation of Xi’an subway as the research object. The occupational health risk AHP model of subway maintenance operation was established from four aspects, which were occupational hazard factors, environmental factors, human-computer interaction factors and management factors. The gray analysis method was used to evaluate its uncertain risk. The comprehensive risk assessment results of occupational health for subway maintenance workers is between low and low risk level, which shown that the grey AHP can be used in the occupational health risk assessment of subway maintenance workers.","['Engineering', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Industrial and Organizational Psychology', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics']"

Biomonitoring is a powerful tool to assess exposure at the individual level, thus providing additional and valuable information in comparison with air monitoring. The present review aimed to compile the biomonitoring studies performed in occupational settings in Portugal, to assess exposure to chemicals and discuss the further use of the results obtained. An extensive search was performed to identify scientific papers available in PubMed and Web of Science, reporting data of occupational studies performed in Portugal, which included biomonitoring as a tool to assess exposure to chemicals. From the twenty-five scientific papers available, it was possible to conclude that most of the biomonitoring studies developed in Portugal in the scope of occupational health aimed to characterize the exposure and to validate new biomarkers and matrices. The further use of biomonitoring data for regulatory risk assessment is scarce or absent. Therefore, several challenges are posed in this area of knowledge for the scientific community to increment the use of biomonitoring as a tool for exposure/risk assessment and risk management.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Occupational Medicine/Industrial Medicine', 'Industrial and Organizational Psychology']"

The time-frequency analysis-based data-driven method provides good opportunities for implementing a strategy of long-term SHM for the bridge by using measured vibration signals. But there are limitations associated with complex and time-consuming feature extraction and decision-making procedures due to high-dimensional big data. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative strategy that integrates the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert transform (HT) for informative feature extraction for bridge condition assessment. The efficiency of the suggested method is evaluated using data pertinent to a cable-stayed bridge. The findings demonstrate that the proposed technique is effective and robust in extracting informative features for bridge assessments in cases highly characterized by big data without any concerns regarding the information loss about the structural state. It is concluded that the proposed technique can address the issues of identifying data anomalies that are reliable early warning signs for future bridge failure and produce interpretable signal analyses that can handle BD with numerous periodic components, nonlinear functions, and periodic mode amplitudes as well as the problems of identifying data anomalies that are trustworthy early warning indications for upcoming bridge failure.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Environment, general', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Water, general']"

Background Despite the increased number of vehicle fires, few studies assessed the compounds emitted and their potential health risks to firefighting forces. Method A literature review based on PRISMA methodology was performed regarding the characterization of vehicle fire emissions and associated firefighters’ exposure to the pollutants released during fires. Results Available literature characterized emissions during training fire events and so far, only one study evaluated the emissions from an emergency fire event. Increased levels of particulate matter, mainly the fine/ultrafine fractions, carbon monoxide (3–4 ppm inside the passenger compartment), and total volatile organic compounds (1.5–722.4 ppm; 3.16–502.7 mg/m 3 ) were reported during vehicle fires. More specifically, benzene (0.38–60 mg/m 3 ), styrene (0.45–314 mg/m 3 ), methane (0.8–110.0 ppm), butanol (81.8–181.6 ppm), and naphthalene (0.170–1.200 mg/m 3 at the cabin compartment) were also present in fire emissions. Despite scarce, evidence highlighted the contribution of vehicle fire emissions to firefighters’ occupational exposure. Conclusion Further studies should be conducted to provide a more detailed characterization of vehicle fires emissions and associated firefighters’ exposure, thus moving the scientific knowledge forward in order to promote firefighters’ safety and health.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Occupational Medicine/Industrial Medicine', 'Industrial and Organizational Psychology']"

Occupational biomonitoring surveys predominantly use the collection of blood and/or urine. Objectives This work provides a compilation of available biomonitoring studies including the collection of saliva in occupationally exposed individuals. Method Literature research was performed in different online databases and, after applying the inclusion criteria, a total of 23 studies were selected. Results Available evidence demonstrates the use of saliva to assess recent exposure to metals and heavy metals (e.g., 3.03–129.0 µg/L of lead, 0.14–59.7 µg/L of cadmium, and 2.0–11.1 µg/L of mercury), volatile organic compounds (8.5–28.2 µg/L of styrene, 7.09 µg/L of toluene, 0.530–3.30 µg/L of phenanthrene, 0.437–1.48 µg/L of fluorene, 0.05–1.45 µg/L of acenaphthylene, 0.210–1.10 µg/L of fluoranthene, 0.230–0.860 µg/L of pyrene, 0.270–0.430 µg/L of naphthalene, and 0.199–0.329 µg/L of anthracene), and pesticides (0.047–4130 µg/L of atrazine, diazinon, and ethion) in workers. Conclusion Saliva has the potential to be used in occupational biomonitoring surveys. However, future health surveillance studies should include the collection of saliva to better characterize workers’ recent exposure to occupational pollutants, explore its correlation with other biological fluids (e.g., serum, plasma, and urine), and improve occupational health risk assessment.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Occupational Medicine/Industrial Medicine', 'Industrial and Organizational Psychology']"

Symptom network analysis can provide an unique insight into the complex interaction of the various factors as regards to their contribution to all the social and mental health-related issues and vice versa. Objective This study attempts to understand this relationship in patients with alcohol use disorders by using principles of social network. Methods Relevant information was collected from patients attending Drug Deaddiction Centre of Assam Medical College, Dibrugarh, by using a structured tool containing questions related to pattern of use of alcohol and social and mental complications attributable to alcohol. Results The analysis of data by Gephi software showed that regular drinking had high degree score of 19 for social complications. In addition, fights with family members and decreased work performance (weighted degree 19 and 17, respectively) emerged as prominent contributors to social difficulties apart from regularity of drinking in the study population. Harmonic centrality values reveal that frequency of drinking behaviour is more influential than other factors in causing social harms. The degree centrality for network related to alcohol use and mental health-related complications was highest for regularity of drinking followed by stress and depression. Conclusion Frequency of drinking, fights with family members and decreased work performance are prominent contributors to social difficulties while regular drinking is a factor that is even more important than stress or depression in affecting mental health of persons with a history of alcohol.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Biomonitoring, based on biomarkers of effect and exposure, has been increasingly used to characterize the health status of firefighters and promote occupationally safer environments. Objective This study aims to identify possible correlations between biomarkers of exposure and effect among firefighters. Method Scientific databases were used to retrieve all the published information until December 2021. Results A total of eleven studies was found to explore the application of both types of biomarkers (exposure and effect). Chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, metals and other woodsmoke components, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, and flame retardants were biomonitored in blood, and urine. Generally, there were associations between these chemicals and altered biological mechanisms in blood and in urine including oxidative stress, inflammation, DNA damage, metabolic syndrome and thyroid hormone levels. However, overall, these findings, alone, are not sufficient to establish causality. Nevertheless, they are important starting points to address this problem and to stimulate the development of future studies, especially follow-up cohorts, which can gather more information and better confirm these associations.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Occupational Medicine/Industrial Medicine', 'Industrial and Organizational Psychology']"

The pandemic has changed human life, attitude, and behavior. This pandemic added a burden to people’s life and health. With the new variants of SARS-CoV-2, a lot of people are even scared of going to the health centers to get the COVID-19 evaluation in fear of contamination and contagious, which caused the surge in the symptoms at later stages. Data collected across various sources can play an important role in predicting and identifying of COVID-19 virus based on the models and the classifications of this data using the most sophisticated machine learning models. The concern here is accessing or transferring an individual’s data from their personal health devices which defers users’ privacy. In the recent past, there are a lot of research that has been done these days on how blockchain can help to securely track and transfer the data across trusted sources. Adding to this, federated learning also is helping on-device data usage without any critical data to be transferred to various external sources. The proposed study directs the stability of frequent health status with the help of wearable devices that capture health metrics like heart rate, blood oxygen levels, breathing rate, muscle activities, stress, emotions, movement patterns, sleep activity, precipitation, and mind/cognitive functions with the introduction of the data streams and models that can seamlessly transfer the data, with the assurance of data integrity, privacy, and control which is the scope of this paper. The usage of both the emerging technologies provides a value addition in terms of health data exchange with effective data distribution with decentralized privacy and computation. We have also introduced a consent-based personal health device registration mechanism on a blockchain consensus network with digital identity to allow and take back controls over who can access their data. We believe that this solution and the implementation would help everyone to predict the possible COVID-19 infections keeping data privacy at the most priority.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The existing understanding of population aging is based on traditional measures such as old-age dependency ratio and share of elderly population. These are based on a traditional perspective that considers fixed old-age thresholds, such as age 60 or 65. However, age-specific characteristics of population above 60 are different across space and time. Thus, traditional aging measures are not ideal for making cross-country comparisons and do not take into account the multiple dimensions of population aging and do not provide a holistic view of population aging. Several efforts have been made to develop new measures of population aging recently, which accounts for the changing characteristics of the elderly. These measures can be broadly divided into three: (i) adjusted dependency ratios, (ii) multidimensional aging measures, and (iii) measures that use recalculated old-age thresholds. While these measures come up with several unique advantages and benefits, they have their share of drawbacks as well. These measures try to account for the changing characteristics of elderly populations, but they are not simultaneously multidimensional and comparable across different regions. Moreover, most of these recently developed measures of population aging come from developed countries and are thus based on the ideals of well-being among the elderly in the Western world. This chapter provides a critical overview of the existing measures of population aging and throws light on novel measures of population aging that can be comparable across demographically diverse countries.","['Social Sciences', 'Demography', 'Health Psychology', 'Sociology of Family, Youth and Aging', 'Public Health']"

We begin by defining what values alignment is, as well as linking it to self-determination theory and authenticity in professional practice. We then identify three key areas in which values alignment can pose a challenge. At the micro, individual level, values alignment can become a point of contention in personal interactions of pediatricians with their patients and their families, or while navigating challenges pertaining to work-life balance. At the meso, institutional level, values alignment can be threatened by administrative pressures and dissonance between personal and organizational values. Finally, macro, structural level challenges to values alignment stem from policies and the cultural contexts that pediatricians work within. Our overall goal in this chapter is to demonstrate that while values alignment is primarily experienced at the personal level, it is largely shaped by organizational and socio-cultural factors that extend far beyond pediatricians’ control. We also provide recommendations on how values alignment can be facilitated to promote well-being among pediatricians.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Pediatrics']"

If gender disparities are the outcome of widely differing work situations for women and men they are also influenced by the unequal distribution of domestic work and the tasks of caring both for older and younger generations. Men and women’s working life courses and trajectories are embedded in institutionalized pathways and normative patterns. They participate in the world of work with specific position and defined social role. The chapter shows how working trajectories impact on health among the over-50s, and changing workforce exit norms. Finally, it points out the need to take account of gender-differential career and non-career paths and to redress the inequalities and injustices in this area. The analytical framework of this chapter relies on the concept of sustainable work considered from a life span perspective.

Emerging evidence suggests that cancer-related financial hardship disproportionately impacts Latinos; however, the research on financial hardship, food insecurity, and access to medical care is limited. Results are presented from a cross-sectional survey comparing the prevalence of financial hardship and food insecurity among population-based Hispanic and non-Hispanic cancer survivors, and the relationship between ethnicity, food insecurity, and forgone medical care is examined. The substantially higher prevalence of food insecurity among Hispanic cancer survivors highlights the need for food insecurity screening and prevention programs in community oncology practice.","['Biomedicine', 'Cancer Research', 'Social Structure, Social Inequality', 'Public Health', 'Ethnicity, Class, Gender and Crime', 'Health Care Management', 'Latino Culture']"

The use of traditional and experimental sensor networks and the processing of the data obtained from them allow to identify anomalies in the behavior of structures in operation, as well as to implement early warning systems. The use of accelerometric sensors is helpful for identifying the representative parameters of the structural behavior; the measurements of the displacements, on the other hand, allow a quick estimate of the magnitude strictly correlated to any damage suffered by the structure during a seismic event or a failure. In this work we try to reach the last three steps of the hierarchical structures proposed by Ritter, which are remembered to be damage location, damage assessment, and prediction. To obtain these levels, it is necessary to combine all the analyzes of the simple SHM that leads to the sending of an alarm, to a cognitive capacity of the building, also achieved with the use of artificial intelligence. In particular, the connection of SHM with AI and with building information modeling (BIM) can make the system cognitive, making it capable of managing (e.g., ensure, predict, assess) the healthiness of a building.

Recent research suggests that loneliness is a possible risk factor for type 2 diabetes. This 20 year follow-up study examined whether loneliness is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. As both loneliness and type 2 diabetes have been linked to depression and sleep problems, we also investigated whether any association between loneliness and type 2 diabetes is mediated by symptoms of depression and insomnia. Methods We used data from the Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT study), a large longitudinal health study based on a population from central Norway ( n =24,024). Self-reports of loneliness (HUNT2 survey, 1995–1997) and data on HbA 1c levels (HUNT4 survey, 2017–2019) were analysed to evaluate the associations between loneliness and incidence of type 2 diabetes. Associations were reported as ORs with 95% CIs, adjusted for sex, age and education. We further investigated the role of depression and insomnia as potential mediating factors. Results During the 20 year follow-up period, 4.9% of the study participants developed type 2 diabetes. Various degrees of feeling lonely were reported by 12.6% of the participants. Individuals who felt most lonely had a twofold higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes relative to those who did not feel lonely (adjusted OR 2.19 [95% CI 1.16, 4.15]). The effect of loneliness on type 2 diabetes was weakly mediated by one subtype of insomnia but not by symptoms of depression. Conclusions/interpretation This study suggests that loneliness may be one factor that increases the risk of type 2 diabetes; however, there is no strong support that the effect of loneliness on type 2 diabetes is mediated by depression or insomnia. We recommend that loneliness should be included in clinical guidelines on consultations and interventions related to type 2 diabetes.

Aggressive behavior can be the result of widely understood meteorological factors, such as temperature or atmospheric pressure. This is especially true for people with a high nervous system sensitivity, such as those with mental illnesses. Difficult behaviors might result in conflicts and, in the case of a psychiatric ward, an increased risk of coercive measures being employed. In turn, this might have a negative impact on the treatment process itself and therefore the quality of healthcare. The most frequently mentioned meteorological risk factors for aggressive and auto-aggressive behavior are air temperature and humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed. The seasonality of the impact of the weather (specific months or seasons) is also important. The weather can also synergistically affect the human body through the influence of different weather elements at the same time. However, meteorological factors should not be considered as the sole variable that causes aggressive behavior, for they affect both staff and patients.

The foods having these benefits are components of our daily diets. Functions foods have the capability of lowering the blood lipid levels, reducing the low-density lipoproteins, prevention plaque deposition and also platelet aggregation. Nutrition composition of the foods matters because of their phytoprotective substances and bioactive compounds which reduce the cardiovascular risk. The functional foods such as flavonoids, phytochemicals and antioxidants present in plant and animal sources act as cardio-protective agents. The legumes, peas and lentils are rich in iron, antioxidants and healthy proteins which are helpful in maintaining heart health and reducing the blood levels of atherosclerotic LDL cholesterol. The interaction of functional food bioactive compounds such as phenolic acids, hydroxybenzoic acids, omega-3 fatty acids and PUFA is linked to prevention of degeneration of heart muscles and arteries. One of the animal sources that rich in functional foods is the Fish. It has Omega-3 fatty acids and the intake of fish twice a day strengthens the heart muscles. As concluded in many researches, the fish is a functional food source that has high levels of good fats and high proteins which are recommended for heart. Therefore, this area has many science-based evidences which would be elaborated to enlighten the subject further.","['Chemistry', 'Food Science', 'Food Microbiology', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

As far as India is concerned, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India (MoHFW) is the body responsible for initiating the policy of digitization of healthcare. However the point is—how far digital health services going appropriately in India. Based on NDHB’s comprehensive architectural framework of “Federated National Health Information System” in January 2020 and as the pandemic strategy Medical Council of India and the NITI Aayog released new guidelines on telemedicine with respect to registered medical practitioners, this research needed to be checked. Thus, the examination was done in these aspects. Guidelines were revisited to see how the hospitals in Delhi and NOIDA function based on the records submitted in medical consultation given to patients using telemedicine. It is felt that telemedicine being a nebulous concept in India, it needs to be analyzed in the light of prospective opportunities it would offer. There is a need for collaborative approaches on digital health, revision in the prevailing legal and ethical frameworks, the clinical practices corresponding to standing medical guidelines. Also, it is found that there exist no uniform telemedicine practices balancing the privacy norms, medico-legal responsibility and regulatory standards. To arrive at conclusion, the best practices prevailed in other countries are examined and adopted. It is felt that the policies existing in telemedicine need to be bifurcated as digital consultation, digital photography, remote patient monitoring (RPM) separately.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Here, we have taken an attempt to determine the link between business opportunities and recycling of e-waste by applying microbial activities. To build such a research hypothesis, the advances in the biotechnology-driven recycling process for metal extraction from e-waste have been analyzed in brief. E-waste contains metals, toxic substances, plastic, and halogenated compounds in it. The toxicity of e-waste is unsatisfactory; because it pollutes soil, water, and air by releasing different toxic compounds. Not only human beings it also affects plants and animals adversely in the landfills areas. To tackle a huge amount of e-waste, every country follows some regulating approaches. But, its management is a serious issue owing to informal recycling activities, lack of infrastructure, lack of awareness, and sensitization to handle different types of e-waste's components in developing countries. Proper management can reduce e-waste and develop a sustainable environment. Besides this, e-waste can boost a country's economy if proper management is going on; as it contains valuable materials; recovering such materials can help to earn money, creates job, and also reduce raw materials. So, it is serious as well as beneficial for a country.","['Chemistry', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general', 'Waste Management/Waste Technology', 'Green Chemistry']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-17215-1_2,en,Effects of Organic Agriculture on the Soil Carbon Stock,OriginalPaper,"The soil carbon (C) stock is comprised of the soil inorganic carbon (SIC) and the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock. A site-specific steady state equilibrium soil C stock evolves under natural conditions depending on the balance between soil C inputs (plant residues) and losses (decomposition, erosion, leaching). The SIC stock is perceived as being less dynamic than the SOC stock with uncertain effects of organic agriculture (OA) on SIC sequestration rate, and not the focus of agricultural soil and land-use management. In contrast, the SOC stock receives increasing attention due to its importance for the global climate and soil health. However, increases in the SOC stock may also alter the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance and this must be addressed in the assessment of soil C sequestration practices to mitigate climate change. The historical loss of SOC due to the conversion of natural ecosystems to agroecosystems provides an opportunity to use soil and land-use management practices to partially replenish lost SOC stocks. Topsoil (0–15 cm depth) SOC stocks have been shown to increase under OA management by 1.98–3.50 Mg C ha −1 compared to nonorganic management. But the addition of exogenous C (e.g., with manure) for this improvement and SOC sequestration for climate change adaptation and mitigation may be important. Compared to nonorganic management, topsoil SOC sequestration rates did either not differ or were 0.29–0.45 Mg C ha −1  year −1 higher under OA, respectively. However, assessments of SOC sequestration and stocks for the entire rooted soil profile are scanty but needed to fully address long-term effects of agricultural management on SOC. Lower primary soil C inputs due to lower OA yields and higher losses by tillage compared to conventional no-tillage (NT) system may result in lower steady state equilibrium SOC stocks in OA systems. There is some evidence that root C allocation is higher under OA than that under nonorganic management. More agricultural soils will be managed in the future by OA driven by increasing consumer demand. The net effects of increased soil and land-use management for OA on the global soil C stocks must be critically assessed also in relation to long-term field experiments to support the design of climate-smart and climate resilient agroecosystems. Therefore, the objectives of this chapter are to describe in detail what processes and practices result in changes in SIC and SOC stocks and sequestration in soils under OA management.","['Life Sciences', 'Agriculture', 'Climate Change', 'Climate Change/Climate Change Impacts', 'Climate Change Management and Policy']"

Monitoring burnout syndrome among health care professionals, such as physicians and nurses, is a critical task. On the one hand, medical staff has to be good at controlling their own emotions in confronting the health care challenges; on the other hand, they share similar emotional exhaustion, frustration, and feelings with their own patients. This can lead to medical diagnosis errors, weak performance, and lower quality of treatments. The main purpose of this study is to provide a concise literature review of research works on burnout syndrome among medical staff, including research methods, assessments, solutions, and best practices. No matter their field of expertise and responsibilities, burnout is a considerable common psychological syndrome among medical staff, ranging from 40 to 66%. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) has been the most widely used questionnaire for data collection in the literature. Factors such as age, gender, marital status, and working conditions are identified as the most contributive parameters in the severity of burnout. Furthermore, studies have found that the degree of burnout can be reduced by under-taking self-improvement techniques such as meditation, development of communication skills, peer coaching, and doing art therapy. A considerable number of medical personnel are vulnerable to burnout syndrome in various degrees and forms. This common phenomenon threatens patients’ health and lives due to a reduction in medical care quality.

Simulation is a technique for practice and learning that can be used in many different disciplines as well as for trainees. Simulation is a technique (not a technology) aiming at replacing real experiences with guided ones; that is, it represents a context in which students can exercise and explore various aspects of a specific practical skill. Accordingly, simulation-based learning signifies a useful approach to develop health professionals’ knowledge, skills, and attitudes while protecting patients from unnecessary risks. Simulation involves learning situations that take place under the supervision of an expert or lecturer and is commonly applied as an active learning method in different health disciplines like nursing, social education, radiography, and medicine. This chapter concentrates on historical and pedagogical perspectives of simulation as a learning method in nursing education. Simulation as a learning method builds on pedagogical adult learning theory, with an emphasis on David A. Kolb and Donald Schön’s concepts experience-based learning , reflection-on-action , and reflection-in-action . Simulation-based learning is appropriate for topics such as patient safety, teamwork, and quality of health services.

Bengal delta is mainly reliant on rice as the staple diet and its cultivation often requires irrigation water during summer due to scarcity of fresh water and insufficient rainfall. Therefore, in arsenic exposed area, the use of contaminated groundwater can introduce arsenic into the soil–plant system. Astonishingly, rice grain accumulates up to 10 times more arsenic than other regularly harvested crops and its accumulation differs with geographical location, rice variety, cultivars and cultivation season. Importantly, arsenic concentration of paddy is highly dependent on the primordial arsenic concentration in irrigation water and soil. Geographical attributes of an area are the most significant factors of arsenic content in rice grains, as they are the chief influencer of soil arsenic concentration. In this study, the contamination quotient of rice grain arsenic is determined by the average values from four sampling sites namely North 24-Parganas, Nadia, Kolkata and West Medinipur districts of West Bengal, India and the values are 300, 215, 190, and 137 µg/kg, respectively. Apart from geographical origin, rice grain arsenic concentration also differs with cultivar. So here, rice grains are classified into three different categories according to their arsenic accumulation and assimilation capacity. The maximum amount of rice cultivars in the entire study area are medium accumulators; range of arsenic concentration is > 100–300 µg/kg (n = 45) with an average value of 178 ± 41 µg/kg. Simultaneously, arsenic concentration of rice grain depends on various factors; however, variety is one of the key players. Parboiling with arsenic contaminated water act as a “factor enhancer” during this process in arsenic exposed area. Our study found that sunned rice grains contain lower arsenic (188 μg/kg) compared to the parboiled one (268 μg/kg). Concurrently, the fourth factor is cultivation season. In Bengal delta, paddy cultivation is practiced in two seasons: pre-monsoonal and monsoonal season. The data depicts that monsoonal grain contains lesser amount (224 ± 63 µg/kg) of arsenic than pre-monsoonal (528 ± 434 µg/kg) grain. This can be interpreted by the theory of dilution, because in monsoon season, rainwater mixes with the waterlogged irrigation field and dilutes the initial arsenic concentration. Transport of arsenic-contaminated rice grain grown in arsenic endemic areas to the non-endemic sites and consequent dietary intakes leads to great threats for the local inhabitants.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Earth Sciences, general', 'Geography, general']"

This virus has off-late demonstrated mutations thus making it difficult for the health professionals to adopt a uniform means of cure. Many people due to lack of support have confined themselves at home. The hospitals too are running short of equipment and support systems. Thus, computational connectivity between the patients at home and the hospitals needs to be established. The objective of this paper is to propose a framework/model that connects all the stakeholders so that either in regular monitoring or in emergency cases help can be provided to them. It has been well established through research and case studies that critical factors associated with this disease are oxygen level (SPO2), pulse rate, fever, chest infection, cough causing choking, and breathlessness. Data shall be collected, stored, and analyzed for the above symptoms and for this cloud storage and blockchain technology would be used. It has been established through various studies that non-clinical techniques like AI and machine learning prove to be effective for the prediction and diagnosis of COVID-19. Using this theory as the standard basis, machine learning models like SVM, Naïve Bayes, and decision trees can be used for the analysis, diagnosis, and prediction. Using IoT and its variants, remote monitoring of patient, and consultation can be provided to the patient. Appropriate action would be taken. In addition, a mobile application would enable the patients to gather or read about experiences of other patients. Thus, it would be established through the proposed framework, that an integrated approach of technologies has a great potential in such applications and offers several advantages.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security']"

The PM 2.5 concentrations of IGP peak during October – November due to widespread paddy-residue burning. The present study seeks to determine the mortalities attributable to elevated PM 2.5 levels during the stubble burning (SB) season through the risk of mortality/morbidity due to air pollution (Ri-MAP) model. WHO AirQ+ model was utilized to evaluate the total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortalities at the district-level in Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi for the year 2019. Here, attributable proportion concept was employed to determine the percentage of annual fine PM-related mortalities caused due to high pollution levels of the SB season, i.e., TM sb %. Patiala, Rohtak, New Delhi recorded the highest TM sb % in their respective states in 2019. Despite practically no cases of SB, the highest mortalities per 100,000 people was observed in Delhi. The results of the study indicate that SB activity exacerbates the health risk in populous locations with already high base levels of PM 2.5 like Delhi, Faridabad, Gurugram, and Jalandhar thereby causing an acute stress on fine PM-related mortalities. Gauging the impact of SB from the lens of attributable mortalities proves to be a compelling tool to draw the attention of policy formulators toward forming a systemic policy for tackling this public health peril.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films', 'Energy Systems']"

EU Directive 2002/44/EC was published by the European Parliament to ensure the health and safety of each worker and create a minimum protection basis for all community workers by timely detection of adverse health effects arising or likely to arise from exposure to mechanical vibration, especially MSDs. This standard defines the methods for assessing daily vibration exposure (defined in ISO2631-1:1997). ISO 2631-5:2004 defines the method for assessing long-term exposure. Recently, this standard has been modified by ISO 2631-5:2018. This study analysed the differences between the assessment methods defined in the three standards and determined the contributions made by the last standard. The consideration of posture and anthropometric characteristics, the vertebral levels as well as not only considering the acceleration transmitted through the seat are the most important considerations provided by ISO 2631-5:2018. This fact makes the assessments more precise, providing personalized assessment of long-term WBV exposure, determining the effects on the exposed individuals and the way of working.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Occupational Medicine/Industrial Medicine', 'Industrial and Organizational Psychology']"

The urban lifestyle has made most of the adult population physically less active leading to adverse health impacts. Studies suggest that active transportation, usually through bicycling and walking, can potentially increase Physical Activity (PA) and improve health. In this study, an attempt has been made to quantify PA in terms of Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) for NMT. Two scenarios, such as base case and mode shift to NMT, are evaluated in which the latter scenario shows a 5% increase in the active population and 3% increase in the physically benefitted individuals due to the shift to active transportation. Thus, the population commuting through NMT are sufficiently physically active than other road users and, hence, are less subjected to obesity and other non-communicable diseases.","['Engineering', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Sustainable Development']"

Many young people are not prepared for the academic pressures that come into play in secondary education or find their circumstances are not conducive to patiently and calmly endure the long days in formal education. Some have never really settled to the rigours of formal schooling, and as puberty expresses itself in these students, the impulses to break out, assert themselves or express their unhappiness become stronger. These are the students who are described as ‘challenging’, ‘disruptive’ and ‘disengaged’. This study involved working with six groups of students who had been identified as demonstrating severe behaviour and in need of some additional intervention beyond the classroom to learn and rediscover the value of working within the mainstream classroom. Part of a bigger study examining youth resources and resilience, the component of the study reported here examined the presentation of these young people over a six-month period, as they left behind their mainstream schools and worked in a withdrawal setting over 10 to 20 weeks, returning to their mainstream program one day a week. Students completed a depression inventory, and their teachers rated their competence, attention, and mental health issues before and after the program. The programs work on motivating the students to contain their behaviour and work for change. Follow-up measures recorded improvements in key measures and reduction in depression scores. This study has implications for flexibility in attitudes to inclusion, as a structured ‘time-out’ assisted in reducing scores around aggression and rule breaking, and improved sustained attendance for a substantial proportion of these students.","['Education', 'Education, general', 'Pedagogic Psychology', 'International and Comparative Education']"

Resolving the heterogeneity of the data sources through transformation in single common data model is expensive and cannot be efficiently accomplished with Extract, Transform and Load (ETL)-based frameworks. The research work models the health data sources using Resource Description Framework (RDF) data standards to provides uniform access of underlying distributed data sources. The research work presents the ontology-based data integration solution with R2RML/RML mappings for relational and non-relational clinical polystores. The solution supports schema alignment which develops a common understanding of data. The work also presents the query translation of SPARQL to native database languages using R2RML/RML mappings to enable query answering across polystore data.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Structures and Information Theory']"

Exposure to As occurs primarily by the consumption of contaminated drinking water or food. Its dissolution as a result of redox reactions leads to natural prevalence of As in ground water. Several countries have reported the presence of As in drinking water beyond threshold limits such as India, Bangladesh, Mexico, Thailand and Chile, etc. Its toxicity results in the prostate, lung and skin cancer, skin lesions, rhagades, mitochondrial damage, and may interrupt the DNA repair system. Conventional physicochemical techniques for As remediation are costly and generate toxic products. However, bioremediation technique involving the use of microorganisms, plants or genetically modified organisms, etc. can be efficiently opted as a sustainable and cost-effective technology. Microorganisms evolve several mechanisms such as As oxidation or reduction, methylation or intracellular bioaccumulation in stressed environments. This chapter reviews the possible roles offered by the microorganism in the effective remediation of As from soil–water systems. Moreover, various advancements in the field of bioremediation have been discussed. Different challenges to microorganism-based remediation technologies are also explained.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Earth Sciences, general', 'Geography, general']"

Transition to the market economy of Albania has increased the vulnerability especially for two categories: the youngest, as the new entries into the labour market, and the oldest workers, who found it difficult to be adjusted to the labour market demand, after the failure of state enterprises, changes in working environments, social services, family, etc. The investigation of older workers in the labour market is focused on five dimensions: (1) the labour market structure and employment status of older workers; (2) the employment & VET policies; (3) the work-life balance with ageing; (4) health and (5) retirement. In the beginning of 1990s, the early retirement was the first policy intervention to cope with massive unemployment of older workers. Then, the parametric reforms of PAYG social insurance for increasing the retirement ages and the insurance period have had an impact on extending the working life of older workers of 10 years until 2018. However, the replacement rate was lowering from 74.2% in 1990, to 56% in 1993 when reform started, to further 41% in 2018 which impose pensioners to continue working or delaying the retirement. The increased youth unemployment, atypical and informal employment, has been new challenges for older workers to be adjusted to the labour market demand and only 10% of them can continue working after the retirement age. The development of employment services, VET, health care and social protection have been inadequate to promote social inclusion of older workers. In the framework of the EU integration, Albania has pursued a process of harmonization the legal framework with EU standards. National strategies have been enacted to guarantee human rights, gender equality, and an inclusive society. The social inclusion of older workers into the labour market is a complex issue that depended not only of the Government interventions, but also by the active engagement of other stakeholders. In the Albanian tradition family continues to be a strong supporting institution for older people and children, very likely to the Abbado’s idea in Italy. This chapter is based on an analysis of policy documents, research and statistics from INSTAT, Eurostat, World Bank, etc. The Eurofound’s European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) 2015, and European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) 2016 are used to identify age and gender patterns regarding work-life balance and social inclusion. The analysis suggests that to fully address the complexity of the inclusion of older workers in the labour market, an integrated approach should involve all relevant policy areas such as education, health, employment, and social protection, as well as engagement of all community stakeholders.","['Social Sciences', 'Life course', 'Labor Economics', 'Aging', 'Social Structure, Social Inequality', 'Sociology of Work']"

Lessons from a Multi-sectoral Perspective,OriginalPaper,"Vision Zero is a term mainly connected with road traffic safety and has its roots in the Swedish road safety strategy. It was formally adopted by the Swedish parliament in 1997, and due to the initial success of lowering the number of deaths in traffic crashes significantly, it has become a role model for road safety strategies in countries and cities all over the world. In Sweden, Vision Zero for road safety has also inspired the introduction of Vision Zero policies in other sectors, and this chapter focuses on Vision Zero from a multi-sectoral perspective. The purpose of this chapter is twofold: to present five different cases of Vision Zero policies and to discuss what constitutes a Vision Zero policy based on these five cases. The five cases are found in road traffic safety, fire safety, patient safety, suicide, and workplace safety. Every case has its unique preconditions in terms of laws, actors, scope, etc., but they are also similar in relation to injury prevention and the ambition to decrease the number of deaths and serious injuries. The five Vision Zero policies are summarized by presenting the problem and problem framing, the goal, measures, and solutions as well as leading actors and governing structures. We find that the problem itself is quite self-explanatory in each case but that the problem framing and attribution of responsibility differ. All cases have on paper been inspired by the road safety strategies, but the systems approach, so intimately connected with Vision Zero, is more or less absent in the cases of fire safety and suicide. Furthermore, in the field of fire safety, responsibility is placed on the individual and on the business sector rather than based on a shared responsibility and ultimately on the system designers. In all five cases, there are a set of measures in place, but there are differences in implementation due to temporal factors and also what kind of governing and steering structures are in place. There is also a difference in internal support where the Vision Zero for suicide stands out as having less support among agencies working with the issue. Finally, the monitoring systems differ from case to case. The Vision Zero for road traffic safety stands out as having a monitoring and evaluating system based on specific safety targets ultimately aiming toward zero (management by objectives). Based on the empirical findings, we argue that besides having a clear problem and problem framing, a toolbox of measures, a monitoring system, and a governing structure, a policy based on a visionary approach with an ambition to reach zero needs additional perspectives or criteria in order to be successful: (1) a scientific approach to problem framing and solutions, (2) a comprehensive approach, (3) a long-term commitment, and (4) a system and structure based on governance . These criteria do not necessarily have to be in place in order to adopt Vision Zero, but they are a prerequisite for building a system based on Vision Zero.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

In this study, a cross-sectional household survey of the most frequently mentioned nutri/medicinal plants that are used in anaemia management in Kilifi County of Kenya was done. The results obtained show that anaemia is a notable intractable nutritional disorder in the malaria-endemic region of Kilifi County. Out of the 541 households that were sampled, 92.8% mentioned that they had experienced an episode in the past 3 years. Most of the households (95.7%) that used herbal medicine to treat anaemia reported 78.1% complete recovery (self-reported recovery) from anaemia. Most of the nutri/medicinal plants mentioned are either fruits or vegetables that are used to manage anaemia. Collectively, extracts of Morus alba L . and Moringa oleifera Lam. were mentioned to be safe supporting their application for use as novel food ingredient or product . It is therefore evident that food can be used as medicine.

To encourage engagement and provide evidence-based responses appropriate to participants’ needs, we propose an intent detection model for online support groups based on state-of-the-art natural language processing methods. Such a model enables a chatbot that can increase interactions and improve discussion quality. Posts in social media are often short and noisy, especially in group chat. Furthermore, many intents lack data, overlap and/or have specific priorities. We create a human-annotated dataset of posts with intent labels from 45 three-month online support groups for quitting smoking. We then train and examine models to predict the intent behind each post. To reduce the effect of noisy and sparse data, we fine-tune a massive pretrained language model. Also, to represent the unique relationships between intents, we design customized loss functions for training. Empirical evaluations show significant performance improvements with the proposed method; our best model obtains 95.5% accuracy. We also use a fine-grained set of intents and obtain higher accuracy compared to prior models on online health forums and communities. Accurate detection of fine-grained intents opens up new opportunities to improve online self-help support groups.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In addition, we assessed sex-specific associations between the validated proteins and pathophysiological pathways of type 2 diabetes. Methods This cross-sectional study included Black South African men ( n =380) and women ( n =375) who were part of the Middle-Aged Soweto Cohort (MASC). Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to determine fat mass and visceral adipose tissue, and fasting venous blood samples were collected for analysis of glucose, insulin and C-peptide and for targeted proteomics, measuring a total of 184 pre-selected protein biomarkers. An OGTT was performed on participants without diabetes, and peripheral insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index), HOMA-IR, basal insulin clearance, insulin secretion (C-peptide index) and beta cell function (disposition index) were estimated. Participants were classified as having normal glucose tolerance (NGT; n =546), IGM ( n =116) or type 2 diabetes ( n =93). Proteins associated with dysglycaemia (IGM or type 2 diabetes) in the MASC were validated in the Swedish EpiHealth cohort (NGT, n =1706; impaired fasting glucose, n =550; type 2 diabetes, n =210). Results We identified 73 proteins associated with dysglycaemia in the MASC, of which 34 were validated in the EpiHealth cohort. Among these validated proteins, 11 were associated with various measures of insulin dynamics, with the largest number of proteins being associated with HOMA-IR. In sex-specific analyses, IGF-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) was associated with lower HOMA-IR in women (coefficient –0.35; 95% CI –0.44, –0.25) and men (coefficient –0.09; 95% CI –0.15, –0.03). Metalloproteinase inhibitor 4 (TIMP4) was associated with higher insulin secretion (coefficient 0.05; 95% CI 0.001, 0.11; p for interaction=0.025) and beta cell function (coefficient 0.06; 95% CI 0.02, 0.09; p for interaction=0.013) in women only. In contrast, a stronger positive association between IGFBP2 and insulin sensitivity determined using an OGTT (coefficient 0.38; 95% CI 0.27, 0.49) was observed in men ( p for interaction=0.004). A posteriori analysis showed that the associations between TIMP4 and insulin dynamics were not mediated by adiposity. In contrast, most of the associations between IGFBP2 and insulin dynamics, except for insulin secretion, were mediated by either fat mass index or visceral adipose tissue in men and women. Fat mass index was the strongest mediator between IGFBP2 and insulin sensitivity (total effect mediated 40.7%; 95% CI 37.0, 43.6) and IGFBP2 and HOMA-IR (total effect mediated 39.1%; 95% CI 31.1, 43.5) in men. Conclusions/interpretation We validated 34 proteins that were associated with type 2 diabetes, of which 11 were associated with measures of type 2 diabetes pathophysiology such as peripheral insulin sensitivity and beta cell function. This study highlights biomarkers that are similar between cohorts of different ancestry, with different lifestyles and sociodemographic profiles. The African-specific biomarkers identified require validation in African cohorts to identify risk markers and increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes in African populations.

In December 2020, the newly formed centre-right coalition government re-imposed country-wide lock-down measures under the second quarantine which lasted for 8 months till summer 2021. The executive government remained the key actor within the crisis management process, relying mostly on health care experts in their decision-making.

The Case of Italian Public Healthcare Organizations,OriginalPaper,"In the last decades, the diffusion in Italian Public Healthcare Organizations (PHOs) of accounting and managerial practices, centered on planning and budgeting, have increased doctors’ presence into management roles. Clinical heads of units, becoming budget holders, have to face new accountability purposes. However, PHOs still struggle in implementing effectively hybrid professionalism, due to doctor-managers’ resistance to use budgetary information for decision-making. To overcome these criticalities, doctor-managers’ involvement in PHOs’ budgeting process may be beneficial, as highlighted by Behavioral Management Accounting research on budgetary participation. Nevertheless, without the support of openness in communication with top management, doctor-managers’ hybrid nature might lead them to develop a cognitive distance that may do not fit their predisposition to participate. A strengthening of their involvement in the budgetary information features design might mitigate these risks. In the BMA perspective, this paper explores the role of perceptions of openness in communication in improving the predisposition of doctor-managers to participate in the budgeting process, via the indirect effect of perceived utility of budgetary information. Data were collected administering a questionnaire to 332 doctor-managers of Italian PHOs. The response rate was of 37.95%. Hypotheses were tested through a regression analysis. Our study contributes to the interpretative research on the organizational factors affecting the involvement of doctor-managers in PHOs’ management, offering new insights into the psychological antecedents of budgetary participation. Results show that: perceptions of openness in communication have a positive effect on perceived utility of budgetary information; this latter has a positive effect on budgetary participation of doctor-managers.","['Business and Management', 'IT in Business', 'Business Information Systems', 'Organization', 'Business and Management, general', 'Organizational Studies, Economic Sociology']"

Various professional groups have different, somewhat conflicting, guidelines with regards to recommended age for commencing screening as well as recommended frequency of screening exams, but the trials upon which these recommendations are based were not specifically designed to examine benefit among black women. Furthermore, these recommendations do not appear to incorporate the unique epidemiological circumstances of breast cancer among black women, including higher rates of diagnosis before age 40 years and greater likelihood of advanced stage at diagnosis, into their formulation. In this review, we examined the epidemiologic and socioeconomic factors that are associated with breast cancer among black women and assess the implications of these factors for screening in this population. Specifically, we recommend that by no later than age 25 years, all black women should undergo baseline assessment for future risk of breast cancer utilizing a model that incorporates race (e.g., Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool [BCRAT], formerly the Gail model) and that this assessment should be conducted by a breast specialist or a healthcare provider (e.g., primary care physician or gynecologist) who is trained to assess breast cancer risk and is aware of the increased risks of early (i.e., premenopausal) and biologically aggressive (e.g., late-stage, triple-negative) breast cancer among black women.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery']"

Arsenic translocates in rice plants in a descending manner from root to stem followed by leaf and grain. The present study finds the same descending translocation pattern in paddy grains of a single pedicel of paddy plants in both the arsenic exposed and control sites. The distribution of arsenic gets reduced with height, i.e. paddy grains located in the top part of a pedicel accumulates lowest amount of arsenic. Average arsenic concentration is found to be highest in the rice grains of lower part of the pedicels (272, 205 and 162 µg/kg) followed by middle (257, 176 and 156 µg/kg) and top (220, 162 and 115 µg/kg), respectively in exposed fields (Teghoria and Madhusudankathi) and control field (Pingla). The average decrease percentage of arsenic in whole paddy grains of a single pedicel from lower part to top is found to be 17.6% which is less than the control site (34%). The present study also showed the distribution variation of arsenic concentration and content among different parts of a whole paddy grain. The ratio of average arsenic concentration between rice grain and rice husk (1.15) is observed to be higher compared to the ratio of their average arsenic content (0.26). Interaction of micronutrients (zinc and selenium) present in rice grain has also been studied in comparison to arsenic. This study is also important for understanding the degree of arsenic exposure through consumption of cooked rice. Cooked rice arsenic concentration is governed by several factors where cooking water arsenic concentration plays a major role determining the flow of arsenic between rice and water. The present study observed that arsenic released from cooked rice to water during cooking with five differently arsenic concentrated waters; however, the rate of arsenic discharge percentage got decreased with increasing water arsenic concentration. The reduction percentage of arsenic from cooked rice to water was also found to be variety and cultivar dependent. Therefore, at domestic level, it is recommended to cook rice with arsenic safe water with proper and regular water quality monitoring.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Earth Sciences, general', 'Geography, general']"

Despite the solid motivation behind DOFS-based SHM systems, their implementation for real-time structural assessment is still unsatisfactory outside academia. One of the main reasons is the lack of rigorous methodologies for uncertainty quantification, which hinders the performance assessment of the monitoring system. The concept of Probability of Detection (POD) should function as the guiding light in this process, but precautions must be taken to apply this concept to SHM, as it has been originally developed for Non-Destructive Evaluation techniques. Although DOFS have been the object of numerous studies, a well-established methodology for their performance evaluation in terms of PODs is still missing. In the present work, the concept of Probability of Delamination Detection (POD 2 ) is proposed for a DOFS network; Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) Double-Cantilever Beam (DCB) specimens equipped with DOFS have been tested under static loading, and the strain patterns along with the relative observed delamination size have been collected to generate an adequate database for the POD analysis, suggesting a reference methodology to quantify the performance of DOFS for delamination detection.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Data is the main ingredient for strategic decision-making, which could give businesses a significant advantage over their competitors, by providing customized services or overall experience to their customers and attracting new ones. For this purpose, data mining techniques are being utilized so that valuable information can be discovered and exploited. There is a vast amount of data generated in the field of healthcare that is not getting fully exploited by traditional methods, for reasons, such as their complexity, velocity, and volume. Therefore, there is a demand for the development of powerful automated data mining tools for the complete utilization of these data, and the uncovering of patterns and precious knowledge about patients, medical claims, treatment costs, hospitals, etc. This work focuses on exploiting the best-known data mining techniques: classification, clustering, and association rule mining, which are utilized extensively in the healthcare industry for incident prediction and general medical knowledge acquisition. The data mining process comprises several steps, such as data selection, pre-processing, transformation, interpretation, and evaluation.

If in the past the scientific interest revolved around the question of “nature or nurture,” the current theories of sexology, which are placed in a sociological, biological, psychological, and social perspective, recognize the multifactorial nature of sexual orientation. However, although there have been socio-cultural and scientific advances with respect to different forms of sexual identity, heteronormativity is widespread in the clinical setting, in research and in society as a whole. People belonging to the LGBQ community are still victims of stigma, violence, and discrimination. Studies that integrate biological, psychological, and socio-relational factors are needed to deepen the idea that not all people develop sexual orientation along an identical path. The integration of a sex-positive approach and a biopsychosocial one among health professionals remains an important goal to be achieved in order to reduce discrimination against sexual minorities, the emotional consequences, and monetary costs on health services that can derive from it.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Urology', 'Reproductive Medicine', 'Endocrinology']"

Simulation exercises have a theoretical foundation in a number of perspectives on how adults acquire knowledge, through experience-based learning, reflection-on-action and reflection-in-action, and an emphasis on the sociocultural context. As part of the learning process of simulation, the opportunity for feedback and feed forward is crucial in the learning process. The individual facilitator is particularly important in this understanding of learning. The role of the facilitator is aimed at guiding the student toward learning with the help of didactic and pedagogical methods. Learning in itself is a process that could be defined as a transformation that is not based on biological maturation. In this chapter, we look closer at the nature of train the trainer courses, what separates a facilitator from a lecturer, the significance of a common language and framework, as well as how the side effects and synergies of the facilitator’s skills might benefit academic staff in nursing and other health education programs.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Nursing Education', 'Nursing Research', 'Health Care Management']"

Loss of synchronization mostly concerns modern wireless SHM systems; however, synchronization discrepancies may also occur in cable-based systems in case multiple data acquisition units without global clock management are used. This paper presents the implementation and validation of a concept towards synchronizing SHM data records containing structural response data, which is imperative for obtaining information valuable for accomplishing monitoring objectives. Specifically, the performance of a cross spectrum synchronization approach reported in a recent study, which builds upon cross spectral density phase angles of structural response data transformed into the frequency domain, is investigated with structural response data from real structures. The cross spectrum synchronization approach is implemented into a wireless SHM system and into a cable-based SHM system, and it is validated through tests on a laboratory shear-frame structure and through field tests on a pedestrian bridge, respectively. The validation test results prove that the cross spectrum synchronization approach is capable of complementing traditional clock synchronization protocols, thus enhancing the accuracy of SHM outcomes.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Like other nations in the world, the UAE is also hardly hit by this epidemic in terms of public health and the nation’s economy. This sudden emergence of this pandemic created immense pressure on the hospitals, clinics, and healthcare workers. With the exponential rise in the number of infected persons, the healthcare institutions find it overburdened to handle all the patients at a time. The overloading pressure of treating the COVID-19 positive patients by the healthcare professionals has also increased a high risk on their part. Majority of the countries have also lost their healthcare professionals through COVID-19 infection. To address this problem, the following paper will be organized around three sections. In the first section, we will start by studying and comparing the impact of the COVID-19 in the world and in the UAE. In the second section, we will move to discuss more specifically the impact of COVID-19 on the health institutions in UAE.

We detail a research prospectus guided by virtue ethics to support the development of an integrated line of applied clinical research. In particular, we call for practice-based studies that attend to diversity and equity considerations and address reductionistic misapplications of virtue (which we call virtue bypass ). Finally, we discuss innovative clinical and community applications, including the utility of a dialectical and contextual perspective, the need to consider both individual and communal flourishing, and the potential for communities as intervention sites.","['Psychology', 'Positive Psychology', 'Religion and Psychology']"

The US Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) with medically critical items such as ventilators and personal protection equipment for major public health emergencies proved to be inadequate in the first half of 2020. We seek to address how governments or other disaster management organizations should modify their stockpile approach for a more robust response to disasters than was the case in 2020. To this end, we argue that a “strategic reserve” against rare public health emergencies must not only have inventory but also backup capacity and standby capability. With a highly skewed “demand” distribution reflecting a rarely occurring pandemic or other disasters, we present a three-tiered approach comprising stockpile inventory as the first tier, backup capacity as the second, and standby capability to manufacture as the third.","['Business and Management', 'Supply Chain Management', 'Risk Management', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Operations Management']"

An efficient HI should satisfy prognostic requirements such as monotonicity, trendability, and prognosability in such a way that it can be effectively used as an input in a prognostic model for remaining useful life estimation. However, discovering or designing a suitable HI for composite structures is a challenging task due to the inherent complexity of the evolution of damage events in such materials. Previous research has shown that data-driven models are efficient for accomplishing this goal. Large labeled datasets, however, are normally required, and the SHM data can only be labeled, respecting prognostic requirements, after a series of nominally identical structures are tested to failure. In this paper, a semi-supervised learning approach based on implicitly imposing prognostic criteria is adopted to design a novel HI suitable. To this end, single-stiffener composite panels were subjected to compression-compression fatigue loading and monitored using acoustic emission (AE). The AE data after signal processing and feature extraction were fused using a multi-layer LSTM neural network with criteria-based hypothetical targets to generate an intelligent HI. The results confirm the performance of the proposed scenario according to the prognostic criteria.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

This may lead to wrong diagnosis and medical errors, which can even cost a life. “About 2.6 million deaths are caused yearly due to medical mistakes”, said by WHO. Most of which are due to lack of knowledge about the patient’s medical history. This paper proposes a solution which provides the registered users to store and access their medical details in a web application authenticated by username and password. The user details are stored in the form of electronic records. Electronic health records are very useful as they reduce the traditional way of storing patient records where the management may lose some records of patients which can delay the medication of patients. By adopting the use of electronic medical records, medical errors and its adverse effects can be reduced. In severe cases, the victim may not be in a position to brief about his username and password, so the biometric fingerprint authentication is added for the convenience of medical staff to acquire the victim’s medical history. Different medical attributes like blood sugar level, blood pressure, etc. were present alongside the attributes to upload and store X-rays, scan reports, etc. The novelty of the proposed work lies in the implementation of biometric authentication for accessing the EHR. For the fingerprint matching, k-NN algorithm is used in the proposed work. The main motivation behind the proposed work is to reduce improper medications and also proposing a better way to store medical records without losing any record.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

The former approaches impose group-level statistics from the top down in homogenizing ways. The latter tracks emergent patterns from the bottom up, feeding them back to end users in custom tailored applications, whose decisions and behaviors are coordinated by means of shared languages. New forms of information and knowledge necessitate new forms of social organization to create them and put them to use. The chapters in this book describe the analytic, design, and organizational methods that have the potential to open up exciting new possibilities for systematic and broad scale improvements in health care outcomes.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Health Informatics', 'Psychometrics', 'Health Administration']"

These studies were conducted at a university in Norway from 2018 to 2020. The studies used a qualitative approach, and reflection notes and focus group interviews were used to collect data. The participants (81 students in total) were bachelor of nursing students 2nd year public health nursing students, and students in teacher training (healthcare). The interviews were conducted shortly after the students had performed the simulation activity. The students expressed that the simulation provided a higher degree of realism and seriousness than skill training did. They felt that the simulation was an educational method in which they experienced realistic feelings and stress in a serious situation. The students learned that in an emergency, good communication is important to make the right decision. The simulation was perceived as one of the most effective ways to prepare themselves for the profession of nursing. They experienced learning through describing the course of events during the debriefing process and obtaining feedback from other students to reveal the gaps in their knowledge.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Nursing Education', 'Nursing Research', 'Health Care Management']"

The COVID-19 pandemic crisis which is characterized by constant change and improbability, forced the countries’ leadership to ramp up risk communication efforts. Under this condition, social media platforms played a critical role for quick dissemination of information. Consequently, the current study aims to understand the role of the Saudi Monarchy King Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud on visual health risk communication during the COVID-19 pandemic through social media platforms like Twitter. It explores how virtual space builds an emotional connection to deal with the COVID-19 situation with the local and international community. The research incorporates a multidisciplinary perspective to understand the role of virtual space in constructing an emotional connection with the local and international community in the critical period of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study uses Lasswell’s communication model and Goffman’s dramaturgical framework to review and analyze the official Twitter account “@KingSalman” of King Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud. It explores how social media interaction supports the Saudi Monarchy’s leadership role, comparing front and backstage scripts. The findings indicate that Saudi Monarchy leadership’s influence on virtual space plays an essential part in coping with the COVID-19 crisis and building an emotional connection with the community. It supports enhancing the social capital through bonding, bridging, and linking across Saudi Arabia regions to fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. This study contributes to understanding leadership influence on virtual space and supports dealing with the COVID-19 crisis.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Sustainable Development']"

All ministers in the Dutch government have their own (crisis) authority, the Prime Minister being the primus inter pares without a formal power to overrule any ministerial decision. Numerous governmental advisory bodies have the right to come up with critical reflections. In the creating of safety policies, the legislator is required to take into account a public cost–benefit analysis. During times of regional crisis, the mayors of the greater municipalities are legally given the overall command of said crisis unless a state of emergency is declared. The Covid-19 response in the Netherlands showed another reality in which the Prime Minister and the two ministers responsible for health care de facto took command, advised only by the so-called Outbreak Management Team (OMT) which consists of experts on infectious diseases. No explanation of the OMT advice and the resulting choice of policies were ever published. This centralization of power without a legal basis, as well as the policies that were decided upon, has not been questioned by parliament, mainstream media, the advisory bodies, or decentral authorities. Mild callings for a more integral and proportionate basis for decision-making have been made during the crisis, but have not been answered. The explanation for this unprecedented change in governance patterns is, according to all politicians and top civil servants spoken with during advisory talks, a personal fear for accountability while faced with policy choices that might kill thousands of vulnerable people in short notice.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Comparative Politics']"

Sex workers and other activists have long acknowledged the harms that criminalised regimes cause to sex workers’ psychological, social and economic wellbeing, leaving them with criminal records that preclude participation in other sectors of work, removing from them their children and their places of residence, and amplifying the risks of violence Violence , blackmail and extortion. The success of New Zealand’s Prostitution Reform Act [2003] in the brothel sector, however, depends upon sex workers and brothel operators understanding the provisions of the law and being willing and able to implement them. Drawing on interviews with brothel operators and brothel-based sex workers, this chapter investigates knowledge of the law along with the bureaucratic contexts associated with running brothels as ‘businesses like any other.’ Whilst decriminalisation offers the promise of alleviating the harmful effects of stigma, New Zealand’s brothel operators and sex workers nevertheless continue to experience marginalisation and discrimination. This chapter sets out how they interpret and manage that, particularly through seeking to establish brothels as legitimate and acceptable businesses.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime and Society', 'Critical Criminology', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Gender Studies', 'Social Policy', 'Politics of the Welfare State']"

Unfortunately, these problems are often not detected in time because many people do not have the confidence to express their problems to doctors, psychologists or relevant authorities, causing them to advance to a more critical stage of their condition. However, many people feel more confident sharing their thoughts through social media platforms or chatbots these days, which are a form of liberation where you can lessen the social pressure to express your thoughts through anonymity. That is why this presented study proposes a system with which possible signs of mental health can be detected. This is in a scenario of high school students (young people from 14 to 18 years old on average) through interaction with the chatbot of the high school of the Autonomous University of Zacatecas, and using conversation flows, the chatbot was deployed during a period where the implementation of sentiment analysis algorithm presented an accuracy of 0.86 showing optimistic data for the detection of signs of problems of mental health.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems']"

The COVID-19 pandemic causes additional burden for healthcare systems. In order to overcome these challenges, digital technologies are increasingly used. Especially the past decade witnessed a tremendous boom of artificial intelligence (AI) within the healthcare sector. AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare and to mitigate the challenges healthcare systems are confronted with. The existing literature has frequently examined specific benefits of AI within the healthcare sector. However, there are still research gaps according to different application areas in healthcare. For this reason, an empirical study design has been conducted to investigate the potentials of AI in healthcare and to consequently identify its role. Based on a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), the following application areas for key determinants in healthcare have been identified: management tasks , medical diagnostics , medical treatment and drug discovery . By means of structural equation modeling (SEM), the study confirmed medical diagnostics and drug discovery as positive and significant influencing factors on the potential benefits of AI in healthcare. The other determinants didn’t prove a significant influence. Based on the findings of the study, various recommendations have been derived to further exploit the potentials of AI in healthcare.","['Computer Science', 'Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Tuberculosis gradually attacks the lungs of the patients, where Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the main reasons for tuberculosis attacks which are caused by the bacteria. As innovation of new techniques helps generation minimize the tasks or observation period, Machine learning is one of the popular techniques by which a person or an organization can easily build a model to evaluate data, generate ideas, or prediction of values. Machine learning algorithms are used enormously in different sectors, thus using Machine learning models in the health sector increasing rapidly. Health professionals can easily predict or observe a patient's disease using the previous history of the same patient or different similar patient's history. In the paper, tuberculosis patient's death rationale is harmonized from the World Health Organization dataset of tuberculosis disease’s class called causes and deaths, where the country Bangladesh's dataset has been used. Feature of the dataset is one of the main concerns of the patient's death, which is identified using the Machine learning regression and classification algorithm. Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision tree, Random forest, KNN, XGB, Adaboost and algorithms are used in the process to create a model which can identify the best features and it is figured out that Random forest provides the best results. The prediction model for finding the number of death of patients build using the machine learning regression algorithms, where linear regression prediction accuracy is 0.99943, however, the linear model's features selection for the process are not the best noticeable. The random forest algorithm's prediction accuracy was found 0.97820, which is nearest to the linear regression accuracy.

This text summarises and discusses the results of a psychosocial risk assessment conducted among Staff workers from a clothing trading company operating in Portugal. A consistent strategy of analysis and assessment of the psychosocial risks was put in place, which involved different data collection procedures (reports on safety activities, technical meetings, interviews, questionnaire to workers, etc.) and the application of the SSARA Method—Simplified Risk Assessment System adapted to psychosocial risks. The methodological procedure used made it possible to obtain a map of psychosocial risks for the Staff activity in each of the company’s ten stores. The results show that the activity evaluated presents in general an acceptable incidence of psychosocial risks at work, since most of the risk factors evaluated fall under this category (63.5%) and there is no very high incidence of any risk factors. A positive psychosocial work environment in the stores evaluated was confirmed, which results from the good occupational safety and health policies and practices put in place by the company.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Occupational Medicine/Industrial Medicine', 'Industrial and Organizational Psychology']"

However, this narrative was severely challenged by a spike in daily cases observed in January 2021 due to the lifting of restrictions during the Christmas season. To tackle uncontrolled virus dissemination, the government imposed two periods of national lockdown. In political terms, the health crisis failed to enhance the polarisation of the political system as a close coordination was observed between the Portuguese President of the Republic and the Prime Minister.

This can occur by: (i) conversion of natural ecosystems to agroecosystems which adds carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to the atmosphere, (ii) nitrogen (N) fertilizer production and use adding more greenhouse gases (GHGs), and (iii) compensating for lower yields under organic agriculture (OA) by converting additional areas of natural ecosystems. The entire food system emits currently 16.0 Gt CO 2 e year −1 or one-third of the total global anthropogenic GHG emissions. However, a range of site-specific practices including conventional and OA practices can be combined to reduce overall climate impacts of agricultural production. Among the practices to lessen climate impacts of conventional agriculture is replacing some of the synthetic N fertilizer produced by the Haber-Bosch process responsible for 1.2% of the global anthropogenic CO 2 emissions, with less GHG-intensive manure and management of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). In contrast, allowing some level of mineral N fertilization (e.g., 40% of current average use) would ensure that soils under OA practices are not becoming N-deficient. Enhancing soil health by combining conventional with OA practices may potentially reduce the need for adding climate-negative external inputs. Composite or integrated farming systems combining best conventional and OA practices have become promising with their ability to reduce energy use and global warming potential (GWP). Modern technologies taking advantage of scientific discoveries should be applied in both conventional and OA systems to reduce the negative and promote the positive climate effects of food production. Conventionalization of OA by increasing adopting features of conventional modes of production based on industrial farming methods can potentially reduce climate impacts. Regenerative agriculture (RA) by combining conventional with OA practices enhances ecological processes which may reduce climate effects of agriculture. Overall, many conventional and OA practices are continuously evolving and rather than adhesion to fixed sets of principles, more sustainable and climate-resilient agricultural practices should be developed for site-specific implementation.","['Life Sciences', 'Agriculture', 'Climate Change', 'Climate Change/Climate Change Impacts', 'Climate Change Management and Policy']"

Gender Dysphoria (GD) refers to mental discomfort deriving by incongruence between the expressed gender and the assigned one. The term Transgender refers to identities or gender expressions that differ from social expectations typically based on the birth assigned sex. Not all people living “Gender Variance” express psychological or physic discomfort. The personal gender identity develops influenced by emotionally significant relationships and by socialeducational environment, based on predisposing biological characteristics. Most of clinical and psycho-social studies agree on multifactorial nature of this process, focusing on the combined action of biological, psychological, social and cultural factors. The first symptoms of gender dysphoria may appear from first years of life and then they may persist in puberty and adulthood. The causes of Gender Dysphoria are still unclear. Both psychosocial and biological factors have been called into question to explain the onset. The Gender Dysphoria Treatment aims to reduce, or to remove, suffering of person with GD and it is based on teamwork of psychologists, psychiatrists, endocrinologists and surgeons. The cure is, firstly, psychological and is provided by mental health experts. Hormone therapy can be prescribed to all people with persistent and well documented Gender Dysphoria if there are no medical contraindications; lastly, sex reassignment surgery.

This paper systematically reviews the philosophical shift in independent India’s sanitation policies and creates a timeline of these events. During 1947- 1980, water and sanitation programs were launched together with 244 urban water supply (WS) schemes, 65 urban sewerage schemes, and 228 rural WS schemes being sanctioned. However, it is very clear from the ratio of sanitation schemes to water schemes that WS coverage has been given more importance than sanitation. This period can be considered as the “water supply coverage era” as also the stationary phase of Indian rural sanitation. During 1981–2008, realizing the importance of sanitation in the development of India, separate schemes for sanitation were launched. Massive subsidies were provided by the Government of India (GoI) for the eradication of open defecation (OD), and this period can be referred to as “eradication of OD era”, also as the lag phase of Indian rural sanitation. Though GoI tried to subsidize the toilet construction cost, 74% rural India still follows OD as per WHO report (2006). To catch up with the MDGs, from 2008, GoI focused on the construction of toilets all over India, and 2008–2019 can be referred to as the “sanitation coverage era” which can also be called as the exponential phase of Indian rural sanitation. This review concludes that there is a need for a paradigm shift required from the construction of toilets to sustainable sanitation chain management in India.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes']"

In Sudan, it causes damage more than all other hazards collectively. The impact of flooding on the population’s health is enormous. It can potentially aggravate many of the existing health risks, or even may create a new one through several processes; it increases the risk of infectious diseases directly, through contamination of drinking water, and creation of disease vector breeding sites, or indirectly, through overcrowding due to the people displacement, temporary pause in disease control activities, and related power cuts that may disrupt water treatment. The purpose of this study is to assess and analyze how the community of the study area perceives the risk of health problems during a flood situation and the effect of their perception over their attitude. This could be done by examining the local people's knowledge, awareness, and attitude, community leaders, and local government employees in the area. Through a community based descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study, qualitative and quantitative primary data were involved using a close-ended questionnaire, focus group discussion, and key informant’s interviews. The study has now provided the local authorities with a solid ground that can be relied upon to enhance risk communication with local people in the future and change their negative behaviors and attitude toward health during a flood situation.","['Engineering', 'Fire Science, Hazard Control, Building Safety', 'Natural Hazards', 'Sustainable Development']"

Yet, the crisis has also highlighted problems in the decision-making process entailing a sidelining of parliament. To this effect, the government claimed to follow expert advice from relevant public authorities, which in some instances subsequently proved to be contrary to devised policies. Oppositional contestation of government action surfaced from the first re-opening of society and onwards with right- and left-wing parties disagreeing on pace and sequence. These differences were bridged through compromises reaffirming the durability of the consensus model. While the country has conformed to its neo-corporatist legacy, a minor deviation is detected in the lacking adherence to the flexicurity model as most aid packages targeting industry resemble similar central European schemes.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Comparative Politics']"

Compounds such as bioactive peptides, phytosterols, fibers, fatty acids, and vitamins have the ability to regulate various metabolic processes in human body such as free radical scavenging, inhibition or induction of gene expression, receptor activity, and enzymes. These compounds are becoming an essential ingredient for numerous food industries and food industry-based startups to come up with products that meet the increasing demand of consumer for natural, nutritious, and economical products. Natural and economical sources such as food industry waste, inedible portions of food (seeds, peels, fish head, etc.), aquacultural by-products, and secondary metabolites (microorganisms, plants, and animals) are being used for the extraction of these compounds. The exploitation of such sources contributes well to the economy and environment. Before the incorporation of these bioactive compounds into food application bioaccessibility (release of the compounds from the ingested food system into the gastrointestinal tract), bioavailability (quantity in the circulatory system after digestion and absorption) and bioactivity (physiological response of human on their reaction with other compounds) of these compounds should be taken into consideration. Encapsulation of bioactive compounds is a potential approach to stabilize their bioactivities, control their release, and increase their bioavailability. These are potential elements to replace numerous synthetic or artificial additives and dietary supplements. Still, a lot of detailed study and laboratory research need to be done to use these compounds to their full potential.","['Chemistry', 'Food Science', 'Food Microbiology', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

However, proper management strategy should be developed to enhance the phytoextraction potential of hyperaccumulator and minimize the bioavailability and As contamination to agricultural crops. A greenhouse study was evaluated to assess the effectiveness of phosphatic fertilisers viz. di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and single superphosphate (SSP) with successive two growing cycles on As removal by Chinese brake fern ( Pteris vittata L.) from the contaminated Typic Haplustepts soils of West Bengal, India. Present study evaluated the influence of phytoextraction by the fern ( P. vittata ) on redistribution of As in different fraction (water soluble, exchangeable, aluminium, iron and calcium bound) in soil as well as total and Olsen's extractable fraction in soil and its subsequent impact on rice crop. Among the five fractions, water soluble fraction and Fe-bound As was found in higher magnitude than the other As bound fractions viz. Al-bound, Ca-bound and exchangeable fraction. This fern was grown in As contaminated soils in successive two growing cycles (four months each), and the total As removal from the soil were measured. The removal values of As varied from 6.4 to 13.5% after the first growing cycle and from 10.6 to 23.9% after the second growing cycle. The phytoextracted soils were reused for rice cultivation to reveal the effect of phytoextraction on As accumulation in rice. In this enhanced process of phytoextraction by P. vittata , the phosphatic fertilizers, DAP was contributed greater than SSP in enhancing the more As uptake by the fern as confirmed by our previous study and followed by a significant decrease in available fraction of As in soil and reduced availability for accumulation in rice. Combining the process of two successive cycles phytoextraction with phosphate (DAP) management strategy leads to reduced bio-available fraction in the soil may serve better for soil with medium levels of As contamination. However, these cycles phytoextraction could be prolong with adjustable soil amendments for high As contaminated soil to attain safe limits of As in the soil and reduced the risk of rice consumption in the arsenic affected areas.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Earth Sciences, general', 'Geography, general']"

In recent years, an increase in the importance of compression methods has been noticed in many areas of medicine. Especially in the field of storing, processing and remotely transmitting large amounts of data. Different compression algorithms, based on different methods have been described in the literature so far. Few of them are currently used in monitoring systems and telemedicine. This paper discusses the use of the Matching Pursuit (MP) compression method for electrocardiographic signal transmission using LoRa (Long Range) technology. LoRa technology is one of the communication standards of the Internet of Things. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a diagnostic tool that measures and records the heart’s electrical activity in detail. The ECG is an important tool used to diagnose heart abnormalities. The paper describes research of the effectiveness of the Matching Pursuit algorithm in compressing the ECG signal, using the Dictionary Learning. The signals from the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database were used for the tests. The analyzed signal fragments were divided into 1000 ms parts, which were then resampled and normalized. The learning data was used to create a dictionary of atoms using the Dictionary Learning method. Using the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm for the fragments of test data, indices of non-zero coefficients were obtained. In the next step, using the developed extreme compression algorithm, a byte table that could be transmitted over the network was obtained. In the research, the byte array was decompressed and the signal was reconstructed. Consequently, the transmitted to the original signal similarity was measured for different parameters of the algorithm. Thanks to the development of technology, remote patient monitoring, consulting and medical care can be more flexible and convenient.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Computational Intelligence']"

The main determinant of the effectiveness of IFHCISs for diagnosing and treatment of diseases, prediction of ICU admission of patients during the pandemic and determining the main factors for higher mortality in pandemics is the optimal multicriteria system. An intuitionistic fuzzy interpretation of the classical rank correlation analyzes under the form of intercriteria analysis (ICrA) is proposed for optimizing each evaluation system of criteria in IFHCISs, based on the theories of index matrices and IFSs. The purpose of the chapter is to develop a model for successful optimization of multicriteria systems embedded in IFHCISs by expanding three-dimensional ICrA to multilayer ICrA (3-D MLICrA). The current pandemic situation raises problems about the dependence of pandemy deaths on certain factors. These problems have to process large data sets related to Covid’s mortality, some of which differ in the various reports. The effectiveness of 3-D MLICrA approach for optimizing the criteria of the IFHCIS is also demonstrated by an application on a dataset of total deaths attributed to COVID-19 and 15 key indicators of the European Union countries determining this mortality, provided by European Centre for DPC for 2021.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It was shown that individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder could become influential through their skillful use of the Internet and by cultivating alliances with “traditional” experts. Contrary to expectations of increased individualization under the influence of personalized and precision medicine, online contributors performed solidarity with others with whom they shared numerous similarities. These findings constitute a critical and nuanced intervention into dominant discourses, which approach the Internet either as a quick technological fix or as a postmodern version of Pandora’s box.","['Social Sciences', 'Sociology, general', 'Medical Sociology', 'Medical Anthropology', 'Media Sociology']"

Individuals with mental illnesses face many obstacles such as stigma, prejudice, and unemployment, which dissuades them from seeking help. The emergence of COVID-19 brought light to the importance of mental health. Current online patient–provider networking services act as the proverbial phone book, and finding the right provider can be a shot in the dark. There is a lack of opportunity to converse, connect or interact with providers without paying for a formal appointment. As a result, patients have a hard time finding a compatible provider. In this paper, we present details of a comprehensive journal-like patient and provider connectivity solution for the management of mental disorders. In addition to providing a platform for individuals with mental disorders to confidentially connect with medical service and insurance providers, it allows for group forums among peers. Communication and trust can be enriched with a networking application that allows patients (under an anonymous alias) and providers to freely monitor, like mention and interact with one another before initial contact. Building a privacy-focused networking platform on top of well-known communication mediums like forums and blogs can enhance communication, visibility, and understanding.

Traditionally, engineers or experts are required to inspect and assess the tunnel structure on site regularly. But most of the assessment are subjective and qualitative, failing to achieve reasonable assessment and accurate tunnel maintenance operation. Therefore, some quantitative methods, such as Tunnel Servility Index (TSI), are proposed. However, TSI method only assesses the current condition of a tunnel, without considering its historical monitoring data. With the development of geotechnical engineering, large amount of monitoring data has been recorded. These data are multi-source heterogeneous, making it rather difficult to store and analyse. Database technology, especially Knowledge Graph (KG), is good at storing, managing and mining multi-source heterogeneous data. Based on KG, all data related to tunnel structure can be stored and then taken into account when making assessment; besides, the information of a tunnel from its construction to the present can be recorded in the knowledge graph. In the paper, monitoring data of Shanghai Metro Line 1 is stored in Neo4j, a graph database, to form the metro tunnel knowledge graph. Based on the KG, the metro tunnel is assessed by a dynamic assessment model based on TSI method. The hided statistic relationships among defects are also deduced. Through the application of KG on Shanghai Metro Line 1, the dynamic assessment model is proposed to be effective, reliable and advanced.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Statistics, general']"

Therefore, there is a recurrent need in contemporary technological solutions to create proposals to assist users in a way that is not exclusive to them and makes them feel integrated into the intelligent system. In fact, this is particularly relevant when the proposed technology or system aims to nudge users to form, shape, or change their daily behaviours. In essence, solutions designed for assisting users in that matter need to consider the inclusion of humans in the learning/decision loop and still the literature in the field is scarce. In this work, we identify and address three crucial human requirements that this technology has to integrate to promote a comfortable and long-term use of technology for the effective assistance of behaviour change: trust, engagement, and adaptation. Besides, we propose a collaborative workflow based on hybrid intelligent systems to cover the lack of human requirements and needs of traditional approaches. In essence, this work aims to shed light on how to promote closer collaboration between humans and intelligent agents for behaviour change under the principle that people should not be treated as mere users of technologies and services, but their behaviour should become one of the critical levers for designing and using technologies.

As a result, measurements can be used to optimally manage civil infrastructure. An important key parameter in PC-bridges control is the trend over time of structural responses, such as strain, deflection, and rotation purged from temperature effects. In fact, temperature changes cause significant responses that we must filter out to isolate distortions due to rheological effects in concrete, strand relaxation, and long-term prestress losses. We can quantify the uncertainty of temperature-compensated key parameters a posteriori, after the acquisition of data. However, in the design phase, monitoring data are not available yet; therefore, we must estimate the expected uncertainty a pre-posteriori. In this paper, we propose a logical procedure based on Bayesian inference for evaluating the pre-posterior uncertainty of long-term measurements-trend purged from temperature effects. We verify to what extent this quantity depends on: (i) measurement and model uncertainties; (ii) expected monitoring duration; (iii) sampling frequency; (iv) seasonal temperature variation.

Among many approaches, this study focuses on a Bayesian OSP algorithm optimized using the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) – a blackbox algorithm for continuous problems. The increase in the number of CMA-ES variants warrants the non-trivial selection problem. Nonetheless, it is difficult to say if such a step has been well-conducted in the investigated SHM literature. Hence, this study aimed to improve the existing OSP framework by adding an offline algorithm selection methodology and to demonstrate the framework’s application to buildings. Application to the ASCE benchmark structure showed that the discrete implementation of CMA-ES outperforms a discrete reformulation that used binomial sampling. OSP results were also found to agree with existing literature. Furthermore, case studies quantify that for an undamaged structure, sensor placement that is well-distributed according to the location of the columns and stiffeners gives high-quality OMA results. For damaged structures, sensors should be placed near the damaged region, and failure to do so showed a reduction of MAC value by 0.1. Lastly, with insight from industry research of the Philippine SHM landscape, these conclusions were found to be potential recommendations to improve the current developing practice compared to the international state-of-the-art.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

In this chapter we explore conceptualizations of emotional resilience and mindset in medicine, with a focus on evidence-informed practices particularly useful for physicians. To aid pediatricians in building their own effective and practical “toolkit” for emotional resilience and mindset, we describe a set of interconnected evidence-based practices whose efficacy has been documented by social scientists and mental health professionals. Building on knowledge from social, cognitive, clinical, and organizational psychology we highlight practices including mindfulness, positive psychology, dynamic mindset, self-compassion, caring connection, and relational leadership. For each concept we offer examples of practical applications in the day-to-day life of pediatricians. Our intention is to offer knowledge and tools to increase your own personal well-being and happiness. Our ultimate goal is to support a shift toward a healthier, more sustainable culture of health in the environments in which we all practice.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Pediatrics']"

Patients and Methods A difference-in-differences (DID) approach was used to analyze patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer identified from the National Cancer Database diagnosed during two time periods: pre-expansion (2010–2012) and post-expansion (2014–2016). Patients diagnosed while residing in ME states were compared with those in non-ME states. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of receipt of palliative therapies. Results Of 87,738 patients overall, 7483(18.1%) received palliative therapies in the pre-expansion, while 10,211(21.5%) received palliative therapies in the post-expansion period. In the pre-expansion period, treatment at a high-volume facility (HVF) (odds ratio [OR] 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02–1.18) and non-west geographic location were predictive of increased palliative therapies. In the post-expansion period, treatment at an HVF (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02–1.16), geographic location, and living in an ME state at the time of diagnosis (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.06–1.22) were predictive of increased palliative therapies. Older age, highest quartile median income (zip-code based), and treatment at a nonacademic facility were independently associated with decreased palliative therapies in both periods. DID analysis demonstrated that patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer living in ME states had increased receipt of palliative therapies relative to those in non-ME states (DID = 2.68, p < 0.001). Conclusions The overall utilization of palliative therapies in metastatic pancreatic cancer is low. Multiple sociodemographic disparities exist in the receipt of palliative therapies. ME is associated with increased receipt of palliative therapies in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery']"

Therefore, accurate and quantitative post-earthquake damage evaluation of real-world structures is crucial for safe operation of buildings. Structural-health monitoring provides sensor-based information regarding the structural state and informs post-earthquake building assessment. With the utilization of monitoring data, which is recorded during earthquake excitation, damage-sensitive features (DSFs) can be extracted in both purely data-driven or hybrid forms; with the latter term referring to damage indicators (DIs) that fuse data with dynamic models. In this paper, data-driven and hybrid damage identification methods are introduced and compared with respect to their performance and robustness in detecting and quantifying structural damage. The damage localization and quantification performance are discussed for varying number of building floors. Moreover, numerical models are used to enable the comparison of DSFs with metrics of nonlinearity, such as maximum drift, and with response metrics that are traditionally used to quantify damage, such as maximum inter-story drifts. Finally, uncertainties in DSFs and their sensitivity to sensor noise, prior knowledge of mass and the spectral content of earthquake excitation are assessed to explore the robustness of the hybrid DI.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

It aims to detect, locate and quantify damage to the structure through data acquisition. However, most of the existing SHM systems face challenges performing in real-time due to environmental effects and different operational hazards. Therefore, the use of smart connected devices through the internet has provided flexibility to monitor live structures (buildings, bridge, etc.) from anywhere. These Internet of Things (IoT) devices can be linked to cloud platforms such as AWS for monitoring and analyzing the data. In this paper, a complete architecture is described to enable live monitoring applications on the AWS cloud platform. However, IoT is the network of physical devices that can send and receive data wirelessly without human intervention. IoT allows objects to be sensed and controlled remotely across the existing network infrastructure. Sensors (Accelerometers) use the Xbee protocol to transfer data to a common node (raspberry pi), then to the cloud using messaging protocols. The objective of the work demonstrates the architecture to carry out data collection, analysis, and visualization of sensor data using AWS services that result in the development of live monitoring standalone web interface.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The present work proposes a unified framework for damage detection, assessment, and localization using adversarial autoencoder and wavelet transform in an unsupervised manner. Vehicle acceleration signals from healthy bridge state only are considered for adversarial autoencoder model training. Estimated reconstruction error is used as a damage detection index. Pre-processing techniques of spectrum filtering, and signal averaging are adopted to improve the model performance. Further, the locations of the detected damages are estimated by employing wavelet transform along with signal pre-processing techniques. The approach is tested on numerically simulated vehicle acceleration signals which are obtained by considering a half-car model on a simply supported bridge using finite element analysis. Different damage scenarios with varying severity at different bridge locations have been considered. It has been investigated that the proposed approach is successful in detecting damages with varying damage severity alongside locating their respective locations. The proposed approach also outperforms other unsupervised learning techniques by detecting and isolating different damages effectively.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The analysis of whole genome sequences from causative bacterial pathogens is the most accurate way to determine if bacterial isolates are phylogenetically related and are part of the same cluster of cases. In addition to being useful to determine relationships for defining the scope of outbreaks, whole genome sequences can also be used to identify the likely geographic source of an outbreak – although for accuracy this task requires well-maintained databases of whole genome sequences from clinical, environmental, and agricultural isolates. Whole genome sequences also provide useful information on virulence and antimicrobial resistance for the purposes of risk assessment.

Plant portions that are edible and high in micro- and macronutrients are consumed as food. Aside from providing necessary nutrients for metabolic needs, it can also be used as a magical therapy for a variety of health benefits. Polyphenols, phytosterols, carotenoids, vitamins, and monoterpenes are all bioactive chemicals found in plant-based foods, each with its own chemical and biological capabilities. These are both essential and nonessential chemicals that are found in small amounts in plant products. Plant-derived compounds with protective and therapeutic qualities are also exploited in the development of medications for the treatment of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. The effectiveness of a bioactive chemical is determined by its bioavailability, bioactivity, and stability. Many processes are addressed by bioavailability of bioactive compounds, including liberation from a dietary matrix, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination phases. Various factors, such as food composition and absorption method, have a direct impact on the bioavailability of active substances during intake. The estimated initial value when they arrived in the circulatory system may differ. As a result, determining the presence of bioactive compounds in food is insufficient for determining their impact on human health. The goal of these studies is to look at various approaches for assessing bioavailability of bioactive compounds, including in vivo and in vitro models.","['Chemistry', 'Food Science', 'Food Microbiology', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

On the other hand, the technological progress in the SHM field is making it particularly attractive as a complement to visual inspections and in-situ surveys aimed at assessing the structural safety. Accordingly, several guidelines have been developed with the aim to provide useful recommendations to technician for the design of SHM systems. Nevertheless, because of very case-specific design, so far, a general qualification procedure aimed at assessing the performance of a SHM system is still missing. On the contrary, construction products already share a thorough and well-established harmonized standardization framework since many years, and this resulted in a reliable control of performance. In this study, a preliminary qualification approach for SHM systems is proposed. The qualification scheme is scenario dependent and allows to check the effectiveness of a given SHM system defined in terms of hardware as well as software components. In order to validate the approach, different SHM systems are hypothesized and checked for possible qualification with respect to different scenarios, obtaining encouraging results. The proposed approach, therefore, represents a promising attempt towards a more exhaustive and comprehensive qualification framework for civil SHM applications.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

It used a quantitative research method using a survey tool designed to investigate a sample of citizens in Jordan in reference to their attitudes and behaviours of using both social media and traditional media during the Covid-19 pandemic. Regardless of all the criticism around the simplicity of the bullet theory and its assumption of an all-passive audience when it comes to receiving media messages, this research tests its applicability and relevance in times of pandemics and crises. The study found that Hypodermic Needle Theory remains of a much relevance to assess citizens behaviours during times of pandemics and crisis such as Covid-19. The study revealed that social media was more followed by the study sample during the pandemic to seek information. The perceived media effects were also higher for social media (M = 3.52) in comparison to traditional official media (M = 2.92). The study hypotheses shown no significant differences between males and females regarding their level of following Covid-19 topics and content which means they both follow it equally. Likewise, the study revealed no significant differences between the participants’ age, education level and place of residence in relation to their following of Covid-19 over both social media and traditional media and its effects on the participants. Therefore, this study justifies the continued relevance of the bullet theory in times of crises such as Covid-19. These results also provide a stepping-stone for future empirical research in which investigates more on the effects of the media messages on audiences taking into account the scale of both information and misinformation online in times of crises.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

Still, it is responsible for significant levels of morbidity in many regions of the world, with about 12 million cases annually, and about 600,000 fatalities. Diagnosis of typhoid poses a lot of challenges because its clinical presentation is confused with those of many other febrile infections such as malaria, yellow fever, etc. In addition, most developing countries do not have adequate bacteriology laboratories for further investigations. Decision support systems (DSSs) have been known to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the diagnosis process, in addition to improving access; however, most existing decision support models for the diagnosis of diseases have largely focused on ‘non-tropical’ conditions. An effective decision support model for the diagnosis of tropical diseases can only be developed through the engineering of experiential knowledge of physicians who are experts in the management of such conditions. In this study, we mined the experiential knowledge of twenty-five tropical disease specialist physicians to develop a decision support system based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The resulting model was tested based on 2044 patient data. Our model successfully determined the occurrence (or otherwise) of typhoid fever in 78.91% of the cases, demonstrating the utility of AHP in the diagnosis of typhoid fever.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The benefits range from improved crop productivity, high-yield producing crops to increased income for farmers. Although there is an increase in the cultivation of genetically modified crops, its use in averting food security challenges has been a major debate because of numerous concerns about food safety, impact on the environment, and socio-economic issues. The contentious debate over the benefits and concerns has threatened the implementation of the technology in so many Africa countries. The debate centers on the potential risk that could be posed to human health and environmental safety.

The aspiration to pursue a patient-centered, holistic approach collides with the need to establish commonly accepted diagnostic criteria for different disturbances in sexual functioning, involving one or multiple phases of the sexual response cycle and pain associated with sexual activity. According to recently proposed classifications, which are continuously evolving, the most relevant FSDs include hypoactive sexual desire disorder, female arousal disorder, persistent genital arousal disorder, and female orgasm disorder. The present chapter aims to provide a clinical perspective on these disorders by reviewing the most recent evidence on the pathophysiology, definitions, prevalence, leading etiologies, diagnostic tools, and key therapeutic approaches. Sexual pain-related conditions will be reviewed in another chapter. It is evident that a gender bias still exists, with prominent biological etiologies of FSDs being neglected and understudied at the expense of psychodynamic and relational determinants. Moreover, classifications should serve to advocate the advancement of our knowledge of female sexual functioning. This process goes through the practical translation of the updated nosology in a language that is intelligible to primary healthcare providers all over the world, and ultimately, to women.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Urology', 'Reproductive Medicine', 'Endocrinology']"

Lack of directly available field performance data is mitigated using a high-fidelity finite element model and a probabilistic understanding of the aerodynamic loads under different flight regimes, simulating realizations of the spar’s performance in service. Debonding damage between laminates was included in the model at different locations in the spar, with various damage sizes. Under the expectation of a fiber optic measurement system being used for data collection, the target measurements are uniaxial strain, measured in several paths throughout the spar. Given measured strain, the damage assessment problem is probabilistically formulated by defining local buckling from debonding as the observable damage, which is fundamentally characterized by load-dependent buckling eigenvalues. This FE physical model is highly computationally intensive, so machine learning was used to build a “run time” surrogate model to learn the relationships between inputs – loads and damage conditions, and outputs – strain and buckling eigenvalues. In addition, other surrogate models were created to solve the inverse problem, linking strain data to damage classification (size and location). Finally, the probabilistic frameworks are demonstrated and damage criticality assessment, which is directly related to the buckling load, is performed via Gaussian process regression.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

This study uses qualitative research methods through document analysis. The document analysis method in this study uses the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) technique. A systematic review of 32 studies was conducted to investigate the patterns and relationships of smartphone use on adolescent well-being. The results of the study found that there are four patterns that have been identified that can affect the well-being of adolescents. The four patterns are health, social, behavioral, and educational aspects. Based on the findings of this study, it is clearly proven that there is a relationship between smartphone use and adolescent well-being. However, negative effects were found to be higher than positive ones. Therefore, the use of smartphones among adolescents should be controlled and given attention by various parties such as parents, teachers, and the government.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Mobile and Network Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data']"

This examination is carried out through the lens of the experiences of South Africa, Zimbabwe and Eswatini. It is asserted that the job losses and financial insecurity suffered by the people in these three countries exacerbated their plight, as these countries were already facing various socio-economic problems even before the onset of the pandemic. The paper also gives an appraisal of the AU’s response to the pandemic including its vaccination strategy and argues that in the face of an unprecedented pandemic, the AU ought to be commended for adopting a swift and proactive approach; commensurate with the anticipated scale of the problem. The paper concludes that the pandemic has laid bare the socio-economic problems faced by African problems, the very same problems which the AU sought to address through Agenda 2063.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'African Politics']"

Training data can be simulated using physics-based models. However, this is dependent on model verification and validation (V&V), meaning assembly-level data is still required. Hierarchical V&V is a novel technique in the field of SHM. The aim of hierarchical V&V is to remove the necessity for assembly-level validation data. Instead, the process entails the V&V of subassembly-level models, which are then combined to produce an assembly-level model using dynamic substructuring (DS). This simplifies the data acquisition process in order to reduce the associated difficulties and costs. This paper focuses on the role of DS in the hierarchical V&V process for SHM. DS allows substructures to be used to create an assembly model, and for simultaneous uncertainty propagation. This allows confidence to be established in the assembled models without requiring assembly-level data.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The focus is on the achievement of robustness which is of paramount importance as manufacturing variability within the population and flight condition variability are practically inevitable. Two robust damage detection methods are postulated based on Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) Transmittance Function (TF) stochastic AutoRegressive with eXogenous pseudo-eXcitation (ARX) type representations for eliminating the effects of non-measurable excitation. Robustness to manufacturing variability is achieved via Multiple Model (MM) representations (the MM-TF-ARX method) or Principal Component Analysis (the PCA-TF-ARX method). The achievable detection performance is assessed via Monte Carlo ANSYS-based simulations with a population of 120 composite beams subject to manufacturing thickness variability, two distinct turbulence-like excitation profiles, and three early-stage crack damage scenarios. The results, in terms of Receiver Operating Characteristics curves, indicate excellent damage detection performance for the MM-TF-ARX method, yet inferior for its PCA-TF-ARX counterpart.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

These structures are submitted repetitively to loads such as strong winds, varying temperatures, and increasing roadway or railway traffic. The trainload accounts for a relatively significant portion of the fatigue of critical members. Usually, trains consist of different numbers of carriages, and they cause different levels of stress. Consequently, the induced fatigue damage varies accordingly. This paper proposes an adaptive multi-category train schedule validation approach based on fatigue reliability using bridge monitoring data. The method involves three steps. Firstly, the typical train categories are identified based on long-term train weigh-in-motion (WIM) data, and their percentages are obtained. Secondly, the stress responses under each type of train are collected to establish a database, and fatigue damage is calculated to generate the probability density distribution. Thirdly, the number of different types of trains can be obtained for a typical train daily schedule, and the fatigue damage is calculated and checked with the design fatigue life. The case study of a suspension bridge is used to verify the approach, and conclusions are drawn from the perspective of the bridge management.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

However, major social and economic changes in the United States over the last several decades have had profound impacts on the economic and social well-being of men of lower socioeconomic status (SES) and men of color, specifically Black, Latino, and Indigenous men. These changes have created stark disparities in the ability and capacity of fathers to be involved with their children. Social policies can be effective mechanisms for promoting and ensuring the well-being of fathers, but fathers are rarely the explicit target of policy efforts. Child support enforcement, the only national policy targeting fathers, has produced an inequitable system that disproportionately subjects low-SES fathers and fathers of color to a series of punitive enforcement mechanisms with minimal benefit to children. We provide evidence for the potential of a broad swath of social policies that have not traditionally been targeted at fathers to improve the well-being of fathers and facilitate their engagement with children. We propose that social workers are uniquely positioned to advocate for reforms and expansions to these policies that will improve father, child, and family well-being and promote economic, social, and racial justice.","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Ethics and Values in Social Work', 'Sociology of Family, Youth and Aging', 'Psychotherapy and Counseling']"

However, online damage quantification is difficult as damage initiation and growth are affected by various uncertainties. In addition, various time-varying conditions introduce uncertainty effects on GW features, resulting in a decrease in the accuracy of damage quantification. Therefore, a multi-source feature fusion Gaussian mixture model (MSFF-GMM) is proposed to improve the accuracy of damage quantification. Firstly, MSFF-GMM is constructed by fusing the feature information from multiple channels and multiple specimens under time-varying conditions. Then, the migration index calculated by Kullback-Leibler divergence is used to measure the difference between the GMMs constructed at different damage degrees. Finally, the proposed method is validated for online damage quantification on the typical aircraft lug structure under time-varying dynamic load conditions.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Several models of R/S development have been proposed, but they have neither been well-integrated with each other nor studied and applied broadly in the field of positive psychology. This chapter’s purpose is to draw on existing longitudinal research on R/S development to propose an integrative theory that can guide developmental science and practice on religion, spirituality, and positive psychology. This Positive Religious and Spiritual Development (PRSD) theory posits that people’s religiousness/spirituality (a) is motivated by goals designed to meet psychological needs (e.g., for acceptance, predictability, and competence); (b) consists of mental/neural representations (stored beliefs, emotions, action tendencies, and physiological responses) and R/S habits that develop and change through relational experiences at the micro-, meso-, and macrolevels; (c) is influenced by numerous contextual factors (e.g., age, sex/gender, culture, and faith tradition), including personal and sociocultural assets and liabilities (risk and resilience factors); and (d) interacts bidirectionally with people’s holistic well-being via psychological, social, behavioral, and physical pathways. We offer illustrative examples of PRSD theory, highlight some of its caveats and limitations, and discuss its applications for clinical practice and religious ministry.","['Psychology', 'Positive Psychology', 'Religion and Psychology']"

It is associated with chronic disease, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, serious infections, and even an increased prevalence of morbidity and mortality in countries with poor socioeconomic or environmental factors. Adequate food administration is essential to satisfy the main caloric and nutritional demands of humans. The most significant factors seen in the development of protein-energy malnutrition in areas of high incidence, such as underdeveloped countries, are inadequate food and nutrient supplies. It has been well established that one of the strategies to alleviate undernourishment is the biofortification of staple crops. This is because vegetables and plants are significant sources of crucial nutrients for human growth and development. To enhance plant nutrition, recent tactics aim to formulated balanced and diverse diets with acceptable levels of vitamins and minerals that benefit human health. New advances in plant biotechnology and animal productivity could control key enzymes in several metabolic pathways, enriching important nutrients such as iron and vitamins and decreasing the content of disadvantageous compounds such as acrylamide-forming amino acids and phytic acids. Numerous biofortified crops such as rice, maize, and wheat have been created to resolve the problem of nutrition deficiencies. Some examples of these methodologies are genome editing engineered nucleases, transcriptional activator-like effector nucleases, zinc finger nucleases, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and associated Cas9 endonuclease which have been created and widely studied for their application, efficiency, and specificity.","['Biomedicine', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Genetics and Genomics', 'Physiology']"

The main goal of the current study is to develop guidelines in order to define the requirements and externalities of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) from the Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS) perspective. A literature review was carried out to understand the main concepts applied and semi-structured interviews were applied to five active Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) technicians. It was concluded that companies aren’t prepared to face the challenges posed by I4.0 through an OHSMS and ISO 45001:2018 doesn’t contemplate the new industrial revolution yet. The main difficulties highlighted by the companies were the extensive legislation that doesn’t follow the industrial developments, the high capital required for the initial investment, the difficult access to know-how and the impact that this will have on production.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Occupational Medicine/Industrial Medicine', 'Industrial and Organizational Psychology']"

However, the proportional growth in the production of crops is not happening. This problem can be addressed using information technology in the agricultural process. In this paper, an Internet of Things-based (IoT) system has been designed and developed to monitor soil health. The chemical and physical properties of the soil can be evaluated by measuring different parameters contained in the soil such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, moisture, and salinity as well as electrical conductivity. Three sensor nodes are developed using NodeMCU ESP8266, NPK sensor, EC sensor, soil moisture, and temperature sensor. First, the data obtained from the procured sensors have been tested and validated in the laboratory by adding different amounts of urea and water. These sensor nodes, which are powered by solar, are placed at some desired location in the agricultural fields to collect the soil data. All the sensor data are then sent to the cloud over a Wi-Fi network using Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol for monitoring, further analysis, and decision-making. The data of the soil parameters are stored in a cloud platform, which will allow monitoring of the data in graphical and numerical formats.

Among those cancers (cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, oropharyngeal, and penile), the overwhelming majority can be prevented with vaccination and cervical cancer screening and treatment. While the incidence of cervical cancer has significantly declined in all populations in the United States since 1975, Hispanic women continue to have significantly higher rates of cervical cancer than non-Hispanic White and Black women. In 2018, the director of the WHO announced his call to action for the global elimination of cervical cancer which is defined as an incidence of <4/100,000. Mathematical models indicate that the United States can achieve the goal of cervical cancer elimination (reducing incidence from ~7/100,000 to <4/100,000) by 2030 if we meet the goals set for the country for both vaccination and screening/treatment. The fastest way to achieve the goal is to ensure that all age-eligible women follow cervical cancer screening guidelines, which are for 93% of females to be screened for cervical cancer. Currently only 80% of women follow this recommendation, with lower percentages among Hispanic women (70–78%). Of concern, the percentage of women following screening recommendations appears to be on the decline in the United States. While the rate of HPV vaccination coverage is far below the national goal of 80%, overall Hispanic adolescents have higher vaccine coverage (56.6%) compared to non-Hispanic White (47.8%) and Black (53.3%) adolescents. There is a need to communicate the HPV vaccine’s effectiveness to increase its acceptance, and there is also an ongoing need to promote cervical cancer screening. In addition, providers must consistently deliver strong and linguistically/culturally relevant recommendations for both vaccination and screening.","['Biomedicine', 'Cancer Research', 'Social Structure, Social Inequality', 'Public Health', 'Ethnicity, Class, Gender and Crime', 'Health Care Management', 'Latino Culture']"

In this regard, there is a need to improve “safety culture” as it plays a significant role in improving workplace safety conditions and is viewed as a comprehensive construct having possibilities of interventions at all levels of construction projects. However, the growing body of knowledge on safety culture research makes it difficult to have a systematic and comprehensive view of the subject. Towards addressing this issue, there is a need to systematize this body of knowledge with a comprehensive systematic literature review. The review is based on three-step methodology. First step aims at gathering suitable articles related to safety culture in construction sector. The second step presents the results of descriptive analysis on recent trends in safety culture research. Last step focuses on a detailed systematic review pertaining to definition, factors, and assessment tools that influence the level of safety culture practices. Results of this review help to uncover and provide a comprehensive overview of recent trends and advances governing safety culture research, and it can help academicians and practitioners identify fundamental influence from these published articles. Implications of the study emphasized that the study outcomes can assist researchers and practitioners to have consensus on industry-specific standards.

Nutraceuticals and functional food sector are evolving as a popular segment owing to the increasing awareness of the people towards good health. Another driver for its growth is the factors like unhealthy lifestyle, less exercise, and workouts, which make the dependence on nutraceuticals and functional foods inevitable. It is claimed by many that the Indian nutraceuticals and functional food market are yet to experience the exponential growth. This exaggerates the need and importance of the regulations specific to the nutraceuticals and functional foods. Historically, in India, the food laws were highly ambiguous and the regulations related to this segment were at the back seat, but with the introduction of Food Safety Standards (FSS) Act, 2006, a special emphasis is being given to the regulations of nutraceuticals and functional foods. The nutraceuticals and functional foods that are imported into India also need compliance with the Food Safety Standards (FSS) Act and its rules and regulations. Although the FSS Act 2006 is reforming in terms of compliance and ease to the operators, there still is the need of significant expansion of this act, in order to increase the impact of this law in the whole functional food and nutraceutical industry of India.","['Chemistry', 'Food Science', 'Food Microbiology', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Studies reported in the literature usually analyze the performance of commercial and alternative measurement systems at low frequency. However, the excitation of the transducer with a high frequency, typically above 1 MHz, allows the detection of incipient damage, making it necessary to analyze measurement systems at high frequencies. As it is an analysis region still little explored for the EMI technique, it is necessary to analyze the repeatability of measurements, since the variation of the structural condition is given by the application of damage indices that quantify the differences between impedance signatures obtained before and after the damage incidence. Therefore, experimental tests were carried out using a piezoelectric diaphragm coupled to an aluminum structure, in order to verify the accuracy of measurements by varying the duration and amplitude of the excitation signals of a measurement system that uses sinusoidal signals. The results indicate that the variation of these parameters directly interferes with the precision of the measurements and the impedance signatures, enabling more reliable analyzes to be obtained about the structural condition.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Most children in child welfare systems are not parentless, but rather separated from their parents. Understanding who is labeled as an orphan is important; this labeling tends to dictate the type of services a child may receive. Children lose or become separated from their parents for many, often overlapping reasons. Perhaps the most common reason for parental separation globally is poverty – poverty harms and destabilizes families and communities overall, creating orphans among other ill effects. Other causes of orphanhood may include substance abuse, other diseases, natural disasters, son preference, single motherhood stigmatization, wars and violence, parental migration, and discriminatory disability policies. Children may also be victims of fraud, trafficking, and/or kidnapping. Countries have responded to orphanhood in a variety of ways. Generally responses centered around family preservation are considered most optimal. Other responses include foster care, group homes, and orphanages. When families cannot be reunited, adoptions are sometimes carried out. A broad understanding of the issues of orphanhood may equip educational, medical, social work, and psychological professionals as well as (potential adoptive) parents and volunteers to act in ways that align with orphan’s best interests in particular circumstances.","['Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences, general', 'Social Work', 'Social Structure, Social Inequality', 'Globalization']"

However, the proteins through which these genetic variants influence risk have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to identify proteins and pathways through which type 2 diabetes risk variants may influence pathophysiology. Methods Using a proteomics data-driven approach in a discovery sample of 7241 White participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) cohort and a replication sample of 1674 Black ARIC participants, we interrogated plasma levels of 4870 proteins and four GRS of specific type 2 diabetes phenotypes related to beta cell function, insulin resistance, lipodystrophy, BMI/blood lipid abnormalities and a composite score of all variants combined. Results Twenty-two plasma proteins were identified in White participants after Bonferroni correction. Of the 22 protein–GRS associations that were statistically significant, 10 were replicated in Black participants and all but one were directionally consistent. In a secondary analysis, 18 of the 22 proteins were found to be associated with prevalent type 2 diabetes and ten proteins were associated with incident type 2 diabetes. Two-sample Mendelian randomisation indicated that complement C2 may be causally related to greater type 2 diabetes risk (inverse variance weighted estimate: OR 1.65 per SD; p =7.0 × 10 −3 ), while neuropilin-2 was inversely associated (OR 0.44 per SD; p =8.0 × 10 −3 ). Conclusions/interpretation Identified proteins may represent viable intervention or pharmacological targets to prevent, reverse or slow type 2 diabetes progression, and further research is needed to pursue these targets.

Thereby, some of the most tangible achievements of supranational integration were called into question, including the abolition of internal border controls in the Schengen area and free movement of workers and EU citizens. Against this background, EU institutions and Member States have put into practice a crisis response that may be described as coordinative Europeanization. On the one hand, this approach preserves Member States’ wide latitude to adopt measures for the purpose of safeguarding public health. On the other hand, it establishes an intense mode of coordination among national decision-makers, which has contributed to the streamlining and gradual reduction of border closures and travel restrictions in practice. While this crisis response may thus be viewed as a success, it did not preclude the resumption of uncoordinated measures in the light of new variants of the virus. Thus, the question may be raised whether such a crisis response may merely resemble a fair-weather arrangement. The present contribution will answer in the negative, focussing especially on the discursive impact that coordinative Europeanization generates for national decision-makers. In this respect, it is argued that, despite relatively weak legal instructions, coordinative Europeanization has motivated national decision-makers to duly consider the supranational implications of their actions, even in the context of relative uncertainty surrounding new variants of Covid-19.","['Geography', 'Cultural Geography', 'Political Sociology']"

However, the integration of linear electromechanical actuators is challenging in safety critical systems due to jamming of the driven load. That fault is critical in many applications such as primary flight controls or landing gears extension and steering. This paper reviews solutions currently available for aerospace application, limits for their effective deployment and possible solutions to achieve a condition-based maintenance to reduce costs still guaranteeing safety. Typical conversion mechanisms adopted so far are described along with the failure modes of these systems, contrasting their many advantages. Particular attention is given to the jamming and possible strategies to avoid it. In particular, any structural alteration which can induce jamming can be monitored as prescribed by predictive maintenance approach in order to detect upcoming faults in advance. Among different possibilities available to timely assess latent fault inducing jamming, the analysis of electrical current and/or mechanical vibrations signals by deterministic or statistic approaches are the most promising. In addition they show strong potentialities in implementing data fusion and learning algorithms to identify different EMA operational conditions.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

However, the livelihoods of these traders, and the governance constraints they encounter, are not well-understood outside of the region’s capital and primate cities. This study focuses on two distinct secondary cities in Nigeria, Calabar in the South-South geopolitical zone of the country and Minna in the Middle Belt region. Interviews were collected with local and state officials in each city on the legal, institutional, and oversight functions they provide within the informal food sector. This was complemented with a survey of approximately 1097 traders across the two cities to assess their demographic profile, contributions to food security, key challenges they face for profitability, engagement with government actors, and degree of access to services in the markets. The analysis highlights two main findings. First, informal traders report less harassment by government actors than has been observed in larger Nigerian cities. At the same time, however, the enabling environment is characterized by benign neglect whereby government-mandated oversight functions are not comprehensively implemented and service delivery gaps remain a major hindrance to food safety. Second, there are important differences in the needs of traders across cities, suggesting that policies focused on food safety and improving the livelihoods of this constituency more broadly need to be properly nuanced even at the subnational level.","['Social Sciences', 'Human Geography', 'Urban Studies/Sociology', 'Public Policy', 'Sustainable Development', 'Environmental Policy', 'Sociology, general']"

In this research, a survey was carried out to know the effect of wearing face mask in different education levels. Besides, a study of the speech intelligibility, articulation index and sound quality evaluations were carried out to research which type of the face mask should be used in education settings. The results suggest that there is a correlation between the health effects due to the use of the face mask and the gender or the type of contract. Additionally, there are significant differences in terms of speech intelligibility, articulation index and loudness depending on the type of face mask used, the distance between students and teachers and if the students have hearing-impaired.

However, the critical fracture mechanics prevents a smooth integration of composites in safety designed aircraft. Some compensation strategies are needed to face the occurrence of barely visible damage, including interply delamination and disbonding of stringers adopted to stiffen the airframe. The latter evidences the necessity of crack stoppers in form of rivets or similar connections between the skin and the stringer although composite allow one-piece manufacturing. This brings to light the necessity of crack identification, localization and size estimation to achieve the stringer monitoring and make use of less connections possible. To this end, a novel and promising approach based on guided wave propagation and scattering in composite media is investigated thoroughly using finite element modeling. Firstly, the potentiality of this approach is highlighted making use of a design formulation applied to a linear sensor network located alongside the stringer. Secondly, the interaction between the wave and the stringer is further investigated to achieve simultaneous inspections by an asymmetric design of the sensor network. Theoretical findings demonstrate the ability of guided waves to achieve a local monitoring of the structural performance. The wave focusing can be achieved by locating the sensors appropriately. Numerical outcomes show how a good level of inspection can be achieved making use of fewer sensors possible.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Welding operations are carried out using several posture configurations, which have a negative physical ergonomic impact on the workers, especially in manual welding processes. This empirical research investigates the ergonomics conditions of welding workplaces with the aim of ascertaining the disorders that may be associated with working posture during welding operations among the South African population. Twenty-seven (27) welders were randomly selected, and data was collected using a structured questionnaire. The majority (67 percent of the welders) stated that they experience discomfort and pain whilst they carry out their task, which contradicts ergonomic guidelines for working posture. Forty-eight percent of the welding workers were frequently physically tired. Sixty-three (63) percent agree that they perform repetitive tasks, and a majority of 78% of welding workers reported neck discomfort as a result of tilting their neck posture for a longer period during welding operations. It was deduced that the correlation among risk factors associated with workstation design, repetitive tasks, contribute to the awkward posture adopted whilst welding, that, if retained for a long duration, could lead to musculoskeletal injuries, poor quality of work, and reduced productivity. Based on these results, in order to increase productivity, it was proposed to redesign the welding workstations and to prioritize interventional ergonomic programme to minimize the MSDs problems.","['Engineering', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering', 'Computer-Aided Engineering (CAD, CAE) and Design']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-11272-0_1,en,Introduction,OriginalPaper,"In recent years, policies that extend the working life have been a key feature of European and other countries with post-industrialised economies. These policies focus on two dimensions of work and retirement which governments consider crucial to reform if pension systems are to be safeguarded in the context of ageing populations. First, legal and administrative reforms are pushing back the legal age of retirement thereby withholding pension rights until workers have reached a certain age. Second, defined benefit pensions, so-called because employees and employers know the formula for calculating retirement benefits in advance of paying them, are being phased out and replaced by defined contribution pensions, where the level of contributions, and not the final benefit, is pre-defined and no final pension promise is made. This shift results in the individualisation of pension benefits, since in most cases workers must build up sufficient contributions and invest in pension products on financial markets. The effect of this trend is that workers remain in the labour force longer in order to secure an acceptable pension benefit. Overall, the implementation of these two policies to extend the working life has produced the desired effect of retaining individuals longer in the labour market and easing the pressure on public pensions, as can be seen in data produced by Eurostat since the 1990s: the proportion of people aged 55 years or more in the total number of persons employed in the EU-27 increased from 12% to 20% between 2004 and 2019 (Eurostat, 2021).","['Social Sciences', 'Life course', 'Labor Economics', 'Aging', 'Social Structure, Social Inequality', 'Sociology of Work']"

For lung cancer, precision approaches have focused mostly on targeted therapies directed at tyrosine kinases and immunotherapy. It is proposed that refinements should focus on improved risk stratification of patients at heightened risk of lung malignancy, namely patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). African ancestry is associated with worsened clinical outcomes in COPD and lung cancer, which is relevant for Latinx populations given that varying degrees of African ancestry exist among several Latinx subgroups. The work reviewed here focuses on ORF1p, a protein encoded by Long Interspersed Element-1 (LINE-1) and associated with genetic instability. Because high expression of ORF1p is associated with poor prognosis in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), it is hypothesized that circulating ORF1p can be monitored as a proxy of genetic instability in patients with COPD and lung cancer. Circulating ORF1p levels correlate with FEV1 deficits and airflow limitation (the hallmark of COPD) in former smokers, and tissue expression of ORF1p is increased in TP53 mutant NSCLC compared to wildtype. Understanding the role of ORF1p in COPD and lung cancer and its utility as a biomarker of genetic instability may lead to advances in lung cancer care and development of novel targeted therapies.","['Biomedicine', 'Cancer Research', 'Social Structure, Social Inequality', 'Public Health', 'Ethnicity, Class, Gender and Crime', 'Health Care Management', 'Latino Culture']"

The early phases of the pandemic triggered cooperative intergovernmental relations to take containment measures and urgent health policies, with an uncontested leading position at the federal level. Yet, with respect to economic measures and between the peaks of the pandemic, the diverging positions between regions and political parties re-emerged, partially reinstalling the politicised relations. In addition, the dominant position of executives over parliaments was strengthened during the pandemic, while experts and courts popped up as active players.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Comparative Politics']"

COVID-19 was first confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019, in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, and then rapidly expanded outside of China. To suppress the Covid-19 case, medical volunteers are needed as the main actors in efforts to handle Covid-19 patients. This makes health care facilities also need to focus on the principles of health worker safety, not only focus on the principles of patient safety. This also makes health care facilities also need to focus on the principles of health worker safety, not only focus on the principles of patient safety. The use of hazmat clothes is one of the efforts to protect health workers when in contact with Covid-19 patients. Hazmat clothes are technically referred to as “encapsulated waterproof protective clothing” which is PPE that must be used for officers from the risk of contracting the Covid-19 virus through airborne droplets and contact with patients and patient body fluids. Although hazmat clothing is an important PPE for health workers to stay protected, the use of hazmat clothing for a long time often makes medical personnel feel uncomfortable when providing services. Based on the problems above, the researchers conducted a study on the heat pipe - thermoelectric hazmat suit cooling vest. This technology can absorb more heat than other methods by simply applying the principle of capillarity to the wicks on the pipe walls. schematic of testing a cooling vest on a hazmat suit.

The data-driven method based on the selection of degradation features can be effectively applied to SOH estimation. In practice, lithium batteries often work in complex discharge conditions, but they are charged under constant current (CC) conditions. Therefore, the suitable degradation features of the battery are extracted in this work for accurate SOH estimation. First, the degradation features are summarized and extracted from the CC charging data. Second, the Pearson correlation coefficient is utilized to quantify the relationship between the extracted degradation features and the battery SOH, thus determining the most influential degradation feature. Finally, the long short term memory (LSTM) is used for model training and SOH estimation based on the selected feature. The results show that LSTM model can give reliable and accurate SOH estimation with $$R^2$$ R 2 of 1 and lower mean absolute error (MAE) and maximum error (MAX).","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements']"

We focus specifically on the secondary city context by analysing household survey data gathered from six cities across Ghana, Kenya and Uganda during 2013–2015. We asked how diet composition and diversity, food sources and food security varied by socio-economic status, using expenditure and demographic data to create a proxy for household well-being. In this way, we investigate one of the claimed keystones affecting urban food systems and dietary health in sub-Saharan Africa—that of obesogenic urban food environments. Our findings indicate that the socio-economic status of a household was the most important factor influencing household dietary diversity and food security status, i.e. better-off households were more likely to feel food secure and eat from a greater variety of food groups. In addition, the number of income sources was additionally associated with higher dietary diversity. We also found that a household’s involvement in agriculture had only a small positive effect on food security in one city and was associated with a reduction in dietary diversity scores. Our findings emphasize the importance of supporting aggregated national and international statistics on agricultural production and trade with detailed local analyses that focus on actual household food access and consumption. We also see reasons to be cautious about making causal claims regarding consumption change and obesogenic urban environments as the major contributor to a rising obesity and non-communicable disease burden in Africa.","['Social Sciences', 'Human Geography', 'Urban Studies/Sociology', 'Public Policy', 'Sustainable Development', 'Environmental Policy', 'Sociology, general']"

For example, research has shown that religion/spirituality is related to specific valued emotions and particular emotion-regulation strategies. In addition, religious/spiritual (R/S) practices provide the opportunity to experience positive emotions, partly through emotional embodiment. Second, we propose four effects of positive emotions related to religion/spirituality. Positive emotions support R/S beliefs, and when they are felt during R/S practices, they function as promoters of well-being, prosocial intentions and behaviors, and continued R/S practices (the Upward Spiral Theory of Sustained Religious Practice).

As the geriatric population progresses, the need for novel solutions to manage age-related diseases increases. To combat this, intensive rehabilitation treatment is instituted repetitively. However, the traditional rehabilitation treatment regimes, involving tedious and monotonous activity with numerous repetitions, lacking active patient participation are of boring and strenuous nature. This ultimately leads to suboptimal treatment outcomes necessitating long-term care. To overcome this, a range of interactive and easy measuring technology-based innovative solutions fused with the rehabilitation process is being investigated to ameliorate the effectiveness and productivity of rehabilitation programs and escalate the independence of patients and empower them to administer their treatment. Recently, game-based Virtual Reality (VR) rehabilitation protocol has turned out to be a promising therapeutic alternative, amalgamating Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) with VR to activate neuro-motor functions, sustain motivation and reach rehabilitation goals to improve the quality of life of patients. Virtual rehabilitation is a computer-generated interactive patient-centred simulation system combining computers, special interfaces, and simulation exercises that imitates reality and provides an artificial environment mimicking real-world experience. The architecture of the system is designed in such a way that it can remotely track the patients, obtain data, and tailor the rehabilitation sessions according to the current needs of the patients. VR improves both motor skills and confidence for daily living and in numerous situations to enhance functional results, improving the clinical and social benefits of surgery. Thus, game-based VR is being developed to allow clinicians to create game-based VR tasks and this will serve to drive advances in rehabilitation interventions.","['Computer Science', 'Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This is because food security has diverse areas, and research in all of these areas are important, and would make a meaningful contribution to providing the required solutions to the problem. The food chain from “farm to fork” involves a series of activities, which include harvesting, transportation, processing, preparation, and consumption. For proper health benefits derivable from any food product to be maximised, the steps of food processing and/or preparation become critical due to the loss of nutrients during processing. Carbohydrates are not usually considered as part of nutrients lost during heat processing like other nutrients such as vitamins and proteins, however, considerable losses to nutritionally important complex carbohydrates such as dietary fibre and resistant starch occur during grinding and milling. Resistant starch type 1 (RS1) in foods is a valuable food ingredient that can help reduce diabetes, obesity, and other non-communicable diseases and improve food and nutrition security if its benefits are properly annexed. This chapter aims to draw attention to the usefulness of resistant starch in foods (particularly resistant starch type 1) and proffers ways by which resistant starch can be protected during processing, which will enhance functional food and nutrition security.

A multistage cross-sectional study design was conducted to sample 497 food traders in Mzuzu and 848 traders in Dschang. A questionnaire was administered to obtain data related to food safety practices, knowledge and sociodemographic characteristics of participants. Problems revealed by the survey included a lack of the following: knowledge about food safety regulations; toilet and hand washing facilities; waste bins and health inspections. The study suggests poor compliance of food hygiene practices among food traders. It highlights the lack of adequate action by the municipal government in educating food traders and enforcing food safety regulations.","['Social Sciences', 'Human Geography', 'Urban Studies/Sociology', 'Public Policy', 'Sustainable Development', 'Environmental Policy', 'Sociology, general']"

The mathematical basis of Lpac can be extended to include the perspective of collective behaviour models, which can describe the predictable human behaviour based on the probability of acts. Research in the mathematical field satisfactorily models the movement that individuals follow or will follow in different scenarios (e.g., street crossing, emergency evacuation), including social parameters such as mood and emotions. This paper presents a theoretical case applied to the predictive analysis of behaviours and interactions between individuals working on constructing a slab. It is essential to include the worker’s movement prediction regarding unsafe acts and movements in the risk assessment and add the emotional states. From a case study at the microscopic level, stress can trigger dangerous situations, and its evaluation can prevent them.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Occupational Medicine/Industrial Medicine', 'Industrial and Organizational Psychology']"

Modal parameters are often adopted to define damage-sensitive features, since their strong physical meaning can help interpreting the structural condition. On the other hand, they are also sensitive to changes to environmental and operational conditions. This aspect is critical for an automatic damage detection, because changes in modal parameters due to varying external factors (e.g. temperature) can be greater than those caused by damage. In this context, this paper proposes an application to real data coming from long-term structural health monitoring of axially-loaded beam-like structures under realistic environment. These very common structural elements are usually subject to an axial load that changes under environmental and operating conditions. Since the axial load is not directly known in most real applications, assessing damage using modal-based damage features is a complicated task. In this paper, a data driven approach that does not require a knowledge of the axial load is proposed to filter out the environmental effects on modal-based damage features. The strategy has been successfully tested on data acquired in an uncontrolled environment, and resulted in being a promising solution for real structural health monitoring applications.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Despite the expressive capability and flexibility of such models, their predictive performance relies on access to suitably represenative training data, which in structural health monitoring, equates to data that span the full environmental and operational envelope of the structure. Additionally, given the black-box nature of such models, there is no guarantee that predictions will adhere to fundamental physical principles. In an attempt to address these limitations, recent attention has been directed towards models that seek to combine physical insight with traditional machine learning techniques, referred to generally as physics-informed machine learning or grey-box modelling. In this paper, we seek to incorporate physical insight into a Gaussian process through the use of covariance functions that explicitly capture the evolution of dynamic systems in time. Specifically, within an autoregressive setting, we begin by deriving the covariance for the approximate response of a single degree of freedom system. Consideration is then given to how such kernels may be used when the governing parameters in the equations of motion vary over time, which is investigated here through a varying temperature, and consequently, structural stiffness. It is demonstrated that the derived grey-box models are able to outperform equivalent physics-based and data-driven models over a number of simulated case studies.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Its outbreak and diffusion represented a veritable test for the Italian political system. When the pandemic crisis started, PM Giuseppe Conte headed a coalition government composed by the centre-left Democratic Party and the Five Star Movement. This was an untested and fragile coalition, governing a country in difficult economic conditions and under tight budgetary constraints. To provide a timely response to the pandemic crisis, decision-making was further centralised in the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, with Parliament entrusted, instead, with a marginal or at best reactive role. Yet, both tensions between levels of government—i.e., central government vs. regions—and within the government coalition constrained the effectiveness of executive action. Initially, the pandemic emergency was de-politicised. Its politicisation occurred later, when the crisis became less acute. In early 2021, however, the formation of a super grand coalition supporting the new PM Mario Draghi led to further de-politicisation. The rollout of the vaccination plan and the effective spending of the EU Recovery Funds were widely regarded as necessities leaving little space for party-political games.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Comparative Politics']"

There are few reports of structured M&M conferences in low- and middle-income countries and no report of collaborative efforts to standardize them. Methods The present study aims to gather general surgeons representing most of Peru’s urban surgical care and, in collaboration, with trauma quality improvement experts develop a M&M conferences toolkit with the expectation that its diffusion impacts their reported clinical practice. Fourteen general surgeons developed a toolkit as part of a working group under the auspices of the Peruvian General Surgery Society. After three years, we conducted an anonymous written questionnaire to follow-up previous observations of quality improvement practices. Results A four-component toolkit was developed: Toolkit component #1: Conference logistics and case selection; Toolkit component #2: Documenting form; Toolkit component #3: Presentation template; and Toolkit component #4: Code of conduct. The toolkit was disseminated to 10 hospitals in 2016. Its effectiveness was evaluated by comparing the results of surveys on quality improvement practices conducted in 2016, before toolkit dissemination (101 respondents) and 2019 (105 respondents). Lower attendance was reported by surgeons in 2019. However, in 2019, participants more frequently described “improve the system” as the perceived objective of M&M conferences (70.5% vs. 38.6% in 2016; p  < 0.001). Conclusion We established a toolkit for the national dissemination of a standardized M&M conference. Three years following the initial assessment in Peru, we found similar practice patterns except for increased reporting of “system improvement” as the goal of M&M conferences.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgery', 'Abdominal Surgery', 'Cardiac Surgery', 'General Surgery', 'Thoracic Surgery', 'Vascular Surgery']"

Standard methods of SHM are vibration-based methods like the electromechanical impedance (EMI) method. This method uses a piezoelectric transducer that is attached to a mechanical structure of interest. The transducer is supplied by a harmonic voltage that results in a typically harmonic oscillation of both transducer and structure and allows to monitor the combined dynamic response by measuring the supplied current, and thus, the impedance. Changes of the impedance reflect changes of the structure and can be used to conclude on a potential damage. Today, linear response is typically evaluated by the EMI. Critical damages like delamination in fiber reinforced polymer components could also provoke nonlinear response that might allow more conclusions on the damage. This contribution demonstrates the existence of contact acoustic nonlinearity in an aluminum beam with a free-edge-delamination-like subsurface crack at the end. The investigation is based on transfer frequency response functions between an exciting transducer and out-of-plane surface velocities of the beam measured by laser Doppler scanning vibrometry. For identification of the nonlinear response an identification method is used and verified that is readily published. Furthermore, the diffusion of the nonlinear behavior shall be investigated to conclude on its possible measurement by a transducer that is located at some distance to such a damage.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The mammary gland is a dynamic organ, regulated by the coordinated actions of reproductive and metabolic hormones. These hormones promote gland development from puberty onwards and induce the formation of a branched, epithelial, milk-secreting organ by the end of pregnancy. Progesterone withdrawal following placental delivery initiates lactation, which is maintained by increased pituitary secretion of prolactin and oxytocin, and stimulated by infant suckling. After weaning, local cytokine production and decreased prolactin secretion trigger large-scale mammary cell loss, leading to gland involution. Here, we review advances in the molecular endocrinology of mammary gland development and milk synthesis. We discuss the hormonal functions of the mammary gland, including parathyroid hormone-related peptide secretion that stimulates maternal calcium mobilization for milk synthesis. We also consider the hormonal composition of human milk and its associated effects on infant health and development. Finally, we highlight endocrine and metabolic diseases that cause lactation insufficiency, for example, monogenic disorders of prolactin and prolactin receptor mutations, maternal obesity and diabetes mellitus, interventions during labour and delivery, and exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as polyfluoroalkyl substances in consumer products and other oestrogenic compounds. The mammary gland is responsible for lactation and is regulated by the coordinated actions of reproductive and metabolic hormones. This Review discusses the hormonal regulation of lactation, hormonal functions of the mammary gland, the hormone composition of human milk, and endocrine and metabolic diseases that cause lactation insufficiency. Reproductive and metabolic hormones coordinate the transformation of the mammary gland from a rudimental ductal structure at the onset of puberty into a milk-secreting organ by the end of pregnancy. Lactation onset is mediated by a combination of progesterone withdrawal, circulating and mammary gland-derived prolactin, and glucocorticoids; delayed lactation onset is a major cause of early breastfeeding cessation. Established lactation requires prolactin and oxytocin for milk synthesis and let-down and involves mammary autocrine and paracrine mechanisms triggered by breast emptying; these local mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The mammary gland is an endocrine organ that secretes hormones into the maternal circulation and milk; hormones in milk influence infant development, body composition and the microbiome. Lactation insufficiency is caused by genetic and acquired endocrine disturbances; maternal factors with potential endocrine effects on lactation include primiparity, obesity, preterm birth, Caesarean section and retained placental fragments. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals are environmental pollutants that might affect lactation by altering hormone secretion or mammary gland hormone responsiveness; epidemiological studies highlight potential population-wide effects on breastfeeding.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Endocrinology']"

Triclosan (TCS; 5-Chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol) is an emerging antimicrobial contaminant that belongs to PPCPs. The extensive use of TCS has caused its presence in different water sources, especially in WWTPs effluents, lakes, rivers, and also in sediments throughout the world, posing a risk to the environment and human health. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs), defined as aqueous phase oxidation technologies based on the formation of highly reactive species, such as hydroxyl radicals ( • OH), have been successfully applied to the remediation of wastewaters containing recalcitrant organic compounds. However, depending on the operating conditions, AOPs can lead to the generation of by-products during the degradation of the primary pollutants that may increase the final toxicity of the treated water. In this way, TCS, along with its degradation/oxidation routes, has been related to the formation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as polychlorinated dibenzo- p -dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). Specifically, this chapter focuses on the potential of electrochemical and photocatalytic oxidation, in terms of TCS degradation rate and by-products formation, paying special attention to the potential formation of PCDD/Fs. The role of two electrolytes widely applied in electrochemical oxidation, NaCl and Na 2 SO 4 , as well as the influence of the concentration of a catalyst (TiO 2 ), on the photocatalytic medium, has been analyzed. The toxicity in the treated waters was assessed through the toxic equivalents (TEQ) expressed as the 2,3,7,8-TCDD TEQ concentration, where 2,3,7,8-TCDD is the most toxic congener (NATO Committee on the Challenges of Modern Society (NATO/CCMS)). After complete TCS degradation, TEQ reached a maximum value of 4.78 pg L −1 in electrochemically remediated waters, using NaCl as electrolyte (19 times higher with respect to untreated water containing TCS), whereas the value of the photocatalytically treated waters with TiO 2 0.75 g L −1 was 6.25 pg L −1 (more than 25 times higher with respect to untreated water containing TCS). These results emphasize the importance of the quantitative traceability of the formation of by-products and the resulting toxicity (PCDD/Fs, TEQ,) when applying AOPs to polluted waters containing EPs, especially organochlorines, considered precursors of PCDD/Fs.","['Environment', 'Environmental Chemistry', 'Waste Management/Waste Technology', 'Agriculture', 'Pollution, general', 'Applied Microbiology']"

This data is of high importance to patients but in many cases it is inaccessible. To counteract this effect, many mobile apps have been developed to aid patients in the management of their personal health data. In this article we will present an analysis and comparison of several apps of this sort, selected from those available within the Portuguese market. The goal of this analysis is to create a design framework for a new personal health management app to be developed. It was concluded that despite an ample offer, there is still opportunity to produce a differentiated application for this market, by including innovative features and methods of displaying information, such as 3D models.","['Architecture / Design', 'Industrial Design', 'Digital/New Media', 'Structural Materials', 'Music']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-030-86065-3_14,en,Stopping Arsenic Poisoning in India,OriginalPaper,"In the 1980s, most households of rural India and Bangladesh switched from surface sources for their drinking water – which was causing high incidence of diarrheal disease – to groundwater extracted by hand pumps. However, for tens of millions of people, this groundwater contained high levels of arsenic, which has led to what the WHO has called the “largest mass poisoning of a population in history.” This case study describes the development of ElectroChemical Arsenic Remediation (ECAR), which is a technology that uses iron electrodes to oxidize and remove aqueous arsenic from drinking water. Pilot evaluation of ECAR began in 2011, with a 100 L reactor at a school in Amirabad. However, political tensions in Amirabad caused the subsequent 600 L reactor pilot to be relocated to a school in Dhapdhapi. The findings from this pilot enabled the construction of a 10,000-liter per day (LPD) ECAR plant at Dhapdhapi. During this scaling up process, technical and contextual challenges were encountered and overcome, including those arising from intermittent power supply and a hot/humid climate. Additionally, implementation challenges included training of local operators, ensuring continuity of knowledge within the team, revisiting and correcting early mistakes, and additional engineering work needed during commissioning. The 10,000 LPD plant has been successful both technically and financially. However, after the handoff of the ECAR technology and plant to the local partner, Livpure in 2016, no widespread replication of ECAR plants in the region has occurred. The engineering science behind ECAR continues to be an active area of research, with ongoing projects investigating the implementation of next-generation ECAR technologies in rural California and the Philippines.","['Environment', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Development Economics', 'Development and Sustainability', 'Engineering Design', 'Social/Human Development Studies']"

This is underscored by the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) as essential to strengthening democracy and political governance in Africa. This chapter reviews the progress made by the Republic of South Africa since 2019 on the rights of vulnerable groups. It argues that practices and affirmative actions towards combatting prejudice or eliminating conditions that perpetuate discrimination against vulnerable and marginalised groups at both national and sub-national levels in South Africa have produced mixed results. These include challenges of designing and implementing policies and programmes of social inclusion that address the vulnerabilities of immigrant populations—asylum seekers, refugees, undocumented migrants and gender non-conforming people. Similarly, public and service delivery systems have not prioritised protective measures to secure their lives, properties and livelihoods against violence. Therefore, cooperative governance, socio-economic inclusion and support for vulnerable groups should be incorporated into the national development priorities of South Africa. Starting with the review of national intervention programmes, an overhaul of public participation mechanisms and processes to enhance efficiency in service delivery is critical to sustainably address these challenges.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'African Politics', 'Comparative Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Public Policy', 'Electoral Politics', 'Public Administration']"

In order to reduce costs and guarantee the integrity and longevity of such structures, the use of a reliable Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) methodology, capable of detecting structural defects, is crucial to plan and perform maintenance operations in a way to extend the lifetime of these structures. In this context, Machine Learning (ML) techniques have succeeded in a broad range of applications and can be leveraged to develop accurate and automated SHM procedures. In this work, two different methodologies were successfully implemented to recognize deviating patterns from the healthy state, to detect anomalies in the dynamic response of wind turbine blades. One methodology combines automated modal analysis and the classification of modal parameters with a Multivariate Gaussian anomaly detection technique. The other uses Autoencoders (AEs) to classify frequency-domain data of the structure, i.e., frequency response functions or cross-power spectral densities. The response of the structures was obtained through modal shaker, modal hammer, and pull-and-release testing.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

It is not an objective text that would be impossible to write as one of the initiators of the policy change. But it brings up some of the steps of the process and presents some hypotheses on how policy change might happen. It is claimed that there was no planned process, not even an ideology or well-developed idea, behind VZ from the very beginning. But there were opportunities and events where one thing led to another. The most fundamental being the immediate acceptance from the Swedish Minister of Infrastructure back in January 1995. The most prominent ideas behind VZ are that firstly safety is a matter of how the providers of the road transport system design and build and manage the system. The second idea is that a professional provider cannot trade off the citizens’ life and health for benefits to the society and its citizens. The underlying hypothesis is that tradition and road traffic rules for the road users have been used as an excuse for not undertaking necessary system changes and modifications. The users have always been blamed for crashes and its consequences by the legal system as well as general approach from the society. The last part of the paper reflects on what is necessary to do in the future to eradicate amateurism, populism, and trade-offs from the road traffic safety field. Maybe a “duty of care” legislation needs to be introduced, protecting the citizen from poor design and operations.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

Annually, nearly six million tons of this material are released into the environment globally. Most of the tire debris is encrusted to variable extent with other particles, which are derived from brake and road wear, as well as from soil. First emitted into the atmosphere or deposited onto the road surface, these tire-abrasion particles are subsequently transported by wind and water to different environmental compartments, whereby road runoff plays a crucial role in the distribution. Once in the environment, these particles interact with air, light, and water, which triggers degradation and concomitant release of crucial tire components, such as zinc and various organic tire additives. The tire-abrasion particles and the leachates derived from them during their degradation in the environment can cause various biological responses in aquatic and terrestrial biota, as determined by numerous ecotoxicological studies. Challenges exist with the identification and quantification of the abundance of tire-abrasion particles in the various environmental compartments, the determination of their toxicity, and with the reduction of both their emission and immission into the environment.","['Materials Science', 'Materials Science, general', 'Structural Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

In general, the accident frequency rate is higher in the Finnish food industry than other manufacturing industry. Hence, there is a need to implement further actions to prevent occupational accidents and improve health and safety at work in the food industry. To guide these actions, up-to-date information on accidents at work is needed. This study descriptively analyzed the circumstances, causes, and consequences of accidents at work in the Finnish food industry between 2016 and 2020 (n = 8481). The data were retrieved from the Finnish official national occupational accident database. The results reveal that most of the injuries were minor, such as wounds and superficial injuries, resulting in 0‒3 days of incapacity for the work. The most accident-prone activities were handling objects, movement, and carrying loads by hand. Hands were the most exposed body parts. The most common causes of injury were related to movement and slipping, stumbling, and falling. Focusing on these factors to may support the food industry in preventing and reducing the number of accidents at work.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Occupational Medicine/Industrial Medicine', 'Industrial and Organizational Psychology']"

In many previous works, it could be observed that the amplitudes of the GUW change with temperature. In the TS approach, it is assumed that for each transducer configuration several functions $$M\left( f,T\right) $$ M f , T exist that describe the change of the maximum amplitude depending on the frequency f and the temperature T . It is also assumed that several functions $$F\left( f,T\right) $$ F f , T exist that describe the changes of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) from the amplitude containing the maximum value of the measurement. Furthermore, it is assumed that the functions $$M\left( f,T\right) $$ M f , T and $$F\left( f,T\right) $$ F f , T also depend on the medium in which the GUW propagate, so that a change of the medium results in a change of the functions. This means that these functions can be used for damage detection. GUW data from the http://openguidedwaves.de/ database were analyzed with the TS approach. Data from a carbon fiber reinforced polymer plate with a temperature range from 20  $$^\circ $$ ∘ C to 60  $$^\circ $$ ∘ C were analyzed for different actuator-sensor paths and compared with position-dependent artificial defects. To determine the functions $$M\left( f,T\right) $$ M f , T and $$F\left( f,T\right) $$ F f , T , polynomials were fitted to the measured values of the maxima and full FWHM. The TS analysis showed a detect ability of the artificial defects over the entire temperature range.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Machine Learning', 'Robotics and Automation']"

However, stakeholders today are facing challenges in handling the data acquired from the sensors along with the complexities in post processing for improved productivity and safety standards. Although the currently available state-of-the-art sensors are capable of collection and communication of structural health related aspects, the complexity associated with the data processing scheme and effective wireless transmission of large data-volumes for real-time decision making hinders its value-add for industrial applications. In this context, we propose an early warning system, using smart multi-sensors, with the capability for on-board processing and data logging. Although the developed system could be applied for a wide variety of use-cases, across several industries (including aerospace, automotive and marine), we employ the same for monitoring the health of critical infrastructure elements in this study. Along with shorter decision making timelines, the developed solution would ensure increased cost savings due to a higher degree of automation, increased efficiency, robustness and safety of the critical structures and/or systems.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The study analyzed 523,764 and 1,054,794 social media responses in Pre-COVID and COVID eras respectively. Due to the large volume of the data, for Pre-COVID era, responses from August to December 2019 were considered. For COVID era, responses from January to June 2020 were taken into the account. The organic food categories, considered in the study were Snacks, Fruits, Vegetables, Beers & Alcohol, Meat, Flour, Dairy, Cereals & Savories, Health Drink, Noodles & Fast Food, Dessert and Pizza & Pasta. In the study three-stage filtering for Sentiment Analysis was performed (86.4% accuracy achieved) using Natural Language Processing, Manual analysis of sentiment and Bi-Directional Encoder Representations from Transforms based model. It was concluded that in Pre-COVID era, people were less aware about the health benefits of organic food but in COVID era, the awareness level of consumers rose exponentially about various organic food categories, especially about processed organic food categories and benefits of raw organic food categories. In Pre-COVID Era, consumers were mainly focused on fresh fruits and vegetables. In COVID Era, food categories like Dairy, Meat and Vegetables were at the top. Fruits, snacks, beer and alcohol were also in high demand. While analyzing the Pre-COVID and COVID scenarios, we observed a shift in consumer behaviour from raw organic food categories towards processed and semi-processed organic food categories. Organic noodles & fast food, dessert and health drinks still remained as the least preferred food categories. The study is unique since it provides a macro and micro view of shift in consumer behavior preferences in Pre-COVID and COVID eras using social media at various geographical locations worldwide. This research will help manufacturers of organic food to reshape their existing consumer behavior and market penetration strategies. It will also help in new product designing and increasing the consumer base both at the local and global levels.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Business Information Systems']"

However, the government which was the key actor in the whole process did not use the following summer months to prepare the country for autumn and winter, and the Czech success turned into a catastrophe that continued until Spring 2021. This chapter argues that this undesired development was caused particularly by a combination of cabinet being cradled by success in spring 2020 and its general populist tendencies. This mixture led to the underestimation of the risks associated with the autumn months by the government causing its unwillingness to adopt suitable but unpopular decisions in later stages of the pandemic. As a consequence, the government quickly lost the credibility among the general public whose compliance with the often confusing and problematic rules was constantly decreasing especially if compared to the spring 2020 months.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Comparative Politics']"

In this work, a novel, non-Newtonian multifunctional polymer with unique active/passive capabilities is proposed for impact protection and SHM of composite laminate structures. This Polyboro siloxane(PBS)-based polymer with unique shear-dependant energy absorption characteristics, owed to a phase transition occurrence within its polymeric network, was utilised as scaffold for ferromagnetic iron particles which enabled the manufacturing of the multifunctional matrix for Glass Fibres Reinforced Polymer (GFRP). The iron particles were positioned in the polymer matrix, which was reinforced with glass fibres and employed as outer ply of a laminate structure. Their presence enables a dual functionality of the multifunctional layer: firstly, in the presence of a magnetic field, triggers the phase transition of the polymeric network offering protection to the laminate in case of impacts, and secondly, postimpact allows for the assessment of the internal integrity of the component, acting as an embedded heat source for active Infrared (IR) Thermography. The ability of the iron particles to initiate the phase transition was investigated by means of Low Velocity Impact in the presence/absence of a magnetic field and the laminates were then examined by means of induction thermography, for the evaluation of the internal damage. Results revealed that iron particles in the presence of a magnetic field led to an enhanced protection of the composite laminates, significantly reducing the extent of the internal damage. This novel, low-cost multifunctional layer provides a unique solution for the protection of composite materials, addressing their inherent weak resistance in out-of-plane direction and providing affordable SHM, thus opening new perspectives for smart structural materials which are in great demand in engineering sectors.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

However, the evaluation of a healthy or damaged state from the acquired monitoring data is often a data-driven process that can be subjected to a large amount of uncertainty, resulting in false positives and false negatives. Hence, the main idea behind this work focuses on handling the main issues related to the uncertainty management by exploiting the aggregation of different sources of information. In this context, this study is aimed at detecting and locating structural damages in monumental structures with the aid of a data fusion approach including vibration-based system identification, Bayesian-based finite element (FE) model updating and visual inspections. As a preliminary step, potential damage-sensitive sections are defined on the basis of nonlinear static analyses (NLSA) performed on a calibrated FE model and/or engineering judgment (EJ). Then, a surrogate model is established enabling to transfer knowledge from the monitoring data to the updated numerical models and to solve the inverse problem aimed at deriving the posterior statistics of the uncertain parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by using 1-year of recorded data acquired in a monumental structure named Consoli Palace, located in Umbria, central Italy, a region characterized by high seismic hazard. The palace has been continuously monitored by the Authors since 2017 using dynamic, static and environmental sensors.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

AFAB persons who, later in life, do not identify as female, are said to present a condition named ‘Gender Incongruence’ (GI). They might identify as men, or as non-binary. Persons presenting the condition of GI might experience a Gender Dysphoria (GD), which is defined as the discomfort due to the mismatch between their anatomical characteristics and the gender in which they are self-identifying. Thus, patients with GD are requesting surgical procedure (s) in order to align one’s body—mostly chest and genitals—to best match with one’s identity. The final aim is to reduce one’s dysphoria. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health currently publishes a series of guidelines, which are named as Standards of Care, for patients presenting GI. In this chapter, we provide an overview on surgical planning and technics, and possible outcomes for Chest-Contouring-Mastectomy (CMM) and genital surgery (metoidioplasty and phalloplasty). Nearly all trans men, and many non-binary AFAB individuals might seek for CCM; the surgery mostly consists in (partial) removal of the breast glandular tissue and, often, reduction of the Nipple-Areola-Complex.

Extending prior prison-level qualitative studies which find that nature contact influences prisoners’ self-reported wellbeing, this work used GIS mapping to generate a new prison greenspace dataset, capturing—for a cross-section of prisons in England and Wales—the percentage of greenspace within their perimeters. Econometric estimations confirm that greenspace fosters prisoner and prison staff wellbeing, in that there are lower levels of self-harm and violence, and lower levels of staff sickness absence, in prisons with more greenspace. These relationships persist when prison size, type, age, staffing level, and level of crowding are controlled for. The findings have the potential to significantly influence future prison design. In addition to summarising these findings, the chapter also reports exploratory investigations on whether and how the inclusion of prison layout type might impact on the wellbeing effects of greenspace.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

We aimed to evaluate patterns of hospital and regional adherence to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for gastric cancer. Methods Using the National Cancer Database (2004–2015), we identified patients with stage I–III gastric cancer. Hospital-level guideline adherence was calculated by dividing the patients who received guideline adherent care by the total patients treated at that hospital. OS was estimated for each hospital. Associations between adherence, region, and survival were compared using mixed-effects, hierarchical regression. Results Among 576 hospitals, the median hospital guideline adherence rate was 25% (range 0–76%) and varied significantly by region ( p  = 0.001). Adherence was highest in the Middle Atlantic (29%) and lowest in the East South Central region (19%); hospitals in the New England, Middle Atlantic, and East North Central regions were more likely to be guideline adherent than those in the East South Central region (all p  < 0.05), after adjusting for patient and hospital mix. Most (35%) of the adherence variation was attributable to the hospital. Median 2-year OS varied significantly by region. After adjusting for hospital and patient mix, hazard of mortality was 17% lower in the Middle Atlantic (hazard ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.74–0.90) relative to the East South Central region, with most of the variation (54%) attributable to patient-level factors. Conclusions Hospital-level guideline adherence for gastric cancer demonstrated significant regional variation and was associated with longer OS, suggesting that efforts to improve guideline adherence should be directed toward lower-performing hospitals.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery']"

These chemicals have been placed in a variety of products, some of which are available over the counter and are commonly used. Since many PPPCPs enter the environment they have been commonly identified as contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). Many PPCPs are released form households where they enter the municipal waste stream and ultimately enter a wastewater treatment facility (WWTF). Researchers have characterized the presence of PPCPs through the waste stream and treatment facilities and ultimately in aquatic and terrestrial environments impacted by wastewater treatment end products. In comparison with parent PPCPs, transformation products (TPs) of these compounds are poorly characterized in the same environments. However, mounting evidence suggests that understanding TPs is as critical to understanding the fate and effects of PPCPs as the parent compound. Human metabolites of many PPCPs are known, but TPs of PPCPs can be produced in WWTFs and after be released in the natural environment. PPCPs that are in WWTFs are commonly transformed by both biotic and abiotic processes and not removed from the water system but released along with the TPs into surface waters, that may be used for municipal drinking water downstream or increasingly used as a source of non-potable water for agricultural uses. Some PPCPs and TPs can partition into the sludge phase during wastewater treatment, with a large portion of sludge produced being land-applied as a soil amendment (biosolids). The effects on the environment at times are difficult to quantify because the repercussions can be far reaching and there is a great need to elucidate the pathways and TPs formed as well as the effects on the biome.","['Environment', 'Environmental Chemistry', 'Waste Management/Waste Technology', 'Agriculture', 'Pollution, general', 'Applied Microbiology']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-07258-1_24,en,Particle Filter-Based Delamination Shape Prediction in Composites,OriginalPaper,"Modelling generic size feature of delamination, like area or length, has long been considered in the literature for damage prognosis in composites through specific models describing damage state evolution with load cycles or time. However, the delamination shape has never been considered, despite that it contains more damage information like the delamination area, center, and boundary for structural safety evaluation. In this context, this paper develops a novel particle filter-based framework for delamination shape prediction. To this end, the delamination image is discretized by a mesh, where control points are defined as intersections between the grid lines and the boundary of the delamination. A parametric data-driven function maps each point position as a function of the load cycles and is initially fitted on a sample test. Then, a particle filter is independently implemented for each node whereby to predict their future positions along the mesh lines, thus allowing delamination shape progression estimates. The new framework is demonstrated with reference to experimental tests of fatigue delamination growth in composite panels with ultrasonics C-scan monitoring.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

About 170 million people in the world are affected by long-term exposure to arsenic-contaminated groundwater. Exposure of plants to arsenic, even at low concentrations, causes many major morphological, physiological, and biochemical disturbances. The traditional membrane filtration method, reverse osmosis method, precipitation method, ion exchange method, coagulation and flocculation method are commonly used remediation methods for As-polluted water, but these are expensive. Using perennial woody vegetation to remediate and stabilize heavy metal pollution such as arsenic is an efficient, environmental friendly and sustainable method.

Similarly, micro electro-mechanical system (MEMS) sensors are spreading for monitoring applications, given their appealing costs. Considering the importance of data for a SHM-targeted decision-making process, a conscious use of these technologies requires a deeper analysis from a metrological point of view, to ensure reliability and robustness of the provided data. Consequently, in a multi-node sensing architecture, concepts like sensitivity of each node or data synchronization becomes of uttermost importance, especially if modal parameters extraction is sought. This paper is intended as a warning for designers of SHM monitoring architectures: can we simply replace standard sensing devices with low-cost systems and expect they perform as well as their “stronger brothers”? The answer to this question is tentatively provided by discussing results obtained in a testing campaign performed on some reinforced concrete beams, dynamically tested through two different monitoring systems: a standard, high-performance system exploiting high-sensitivity piezoelectric accelerometers and a low-cost MEMS digital accelerometers-based one, not coupled to a high performance data acqusition system, rather. Modal parameters are considered as the target measure to assess the performance of the two systems.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

This definition may lead to think that human flourishing is unique to people living under privileged circumstances of health and well-being, whereas people with life limiting illnesses are deprived from this possibility. In this paper, we reflect on the idea of human flourishing in the context of palliative care. Although people with advanced illnesses experience in a special manner the limits of human life and vulnerability, and the final stages may inevitably imply considerable suffering, we argue that it is also possible to experience this final stage as an opportunity for personal growth, to live it in full accordance with one's beliefs and values, and to reestablish a profound connection to oneself and to others.

Elevation of arsenic (As) in paddy rice ecosystems has become an environmental, economic, and public concern due to its adverse consequences on global rice production, food safety, and human health. Mining exploitation, weathering of As-bearing minerals, dissolution of aquifer sediments, and As-contaminated groundwater irrigation have extensively contributed to the contamination of paddy soil by As in high levels. Speciation, mobility and sequestration of As in paddy soil–water interfaces are controlled by iron (Fe) plaque formation, redox sensitive mineral surfaces (Fe and Mn), organic matter and competing substances (PO $$_{4}^{3-}$$ and Si(OH) 4 ). During flooding season, paddy soil porewater is contaminated with high concentrations of inorganic As species, particularly by more toxic arsenite (As(III)) as result of arsenate (As(V)) reduction under anaerobic conditions. Microorganisms play a crucial role in As speciation dynamics promoting redox transformation, methylation and volatilization processes. Various metabolic pathways, including As(V) reduction, As(III) efflux, and As(III)-thiol complexation govern As uptake, translocation, and loading into rice grains. The translocation of As from rice root to shoot leads to the accumulation of toxic As species in grains affecting rice quality and yield. The worst scenario of grain As is associated with the human exposure to high amounts of As via consumption of As-contaminated rice and related food products. Hence, this chapter provides an overview of (i) As speciation and transformation dynamics, (ii) As uptake mechanisms from root to shoot, (iii) As metabolic pathways over root, shoot and grain loading, and (iv) recommendations for future research. Such a widespread understanding of As dynamics in paddy rice ecosystems is crucial to develop sustainable As mitigation strategies and alleviate adverse impacts on global food safety and human health.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Earth Sciences, general', 'Geography, general']"

The second natural frequency is known to be nonlinear in temperature, and this will serve as the main focal point of this work. Cointegration is a method of normalising time series data with respect to one another - often strongly-correlated time series. Cointegration is used in this paper to remove effects from Environmental and Operational Variations, by cointegrating the first four natural frequencies for the Z24 Bridge data. The temperature effects on the natural frequency data are clearly visible within the data, and it is desirable, for the purposes of structural health monitoring, that these effects are removed. The univariate time series are embedded in higher-dimensional space, such that interesting topologies are formed. Topological data analysis is used to analyse the raw time series, and the cointegrated equivalents. A standard topological data analysis pipeline is enacted, where simplicial complexes are constructed from the embedded point clouds. Topological properties are then calculated from the simplicial complexes; such as the persistent homology. The persistent homology is then analysed, to determine the topological structure of all the time series.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

For these reasons, some years ago a monitoring system was installed in order to assure its continuous operation. The system is based on accelerometers and clinometers at different floors used for dynamic and static monitoring, respectively. A statistical model was developed, such that the time trend of the first eigenfrequencies of the building were modelled through the trend of the clinometer signals and the root mean square (RMS) of some of the accelerometers. This because it was observed that the clinometer signals and the acceleration RMSs are linked to different environmental variables. As examples: the changes of the static configuration of the building due to sun exposure can be described by clinometer signals and acceleration RMSs can take into account the effect of wind. The use of these signals and indexes simplifies the development of the predictive model, compared to the use of measured environmental quantities. The model showed good performances in foreseeing the trend of the first eigenfrequencies. This paper analyses how the reliability of the model, developed with data acquired in 2015–2016, has changed relying on new data acquired in 2021–2022.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Moving forward past the colonial mechanisms since 1788 has proven difficult. Decolonizing practices in education include embedding Indigenous ways of learning. It is essential to include decolonizing practices in teacher education to allow preservice teachers, most of whom are non-Indigenous, to learn about the barriers that persist for Indigenous students and how to eliminate them. Although Indigenous people have been resilient in the face of adversity for so long, their resilience may be wearing thin, with circumstances and systems continuing to result in environments of social exclusion and inequity. This chapter examines a strength-based approach to educational practice and teacher education by exploring Indigenous resilience, standpoint theory, and cultural strength as tools to understand educational issues differently and consider how Indigenous voices and Indigenous decision-making might change systems. The movement of decolonization through initial teacher education includes using cultural responsiveness and a transformative learning style to create a better-informed workforce of teachers capable of ensuring a promising future for all Australians.","['Education', 'International and Comparative Education', 'Education, general']"

The interventions that constitute vision rehabilitation are tailored to each patient’s functional goals and personal preferences. This chapter describes the theory, structure, and mechanics of an adaptive patient-reported outcome measure – the Activity Inventory (AI). The AI was developed to identify each patient’s unique set of functional goals within a hierarchical framework, to specify the cognitive and motor activities ( i.e. , tasks in different functional domains) the patient customarily performs to achieve his or her personal goals, and to elicit ordinal patient ratings of the importance and difficulty of each goal and the difficulty of relevant subsidiary tasks under goals that meet or exceed defined importance and difficulty criteria. The theoretical assumptions of a Rasch psychometric model that is employed to estimate measures of the patient’s overall visual ability from goal difficulty ratings and ability in each functional domain from task difficulty ratings before and after vision rehabilitation are presented and the results for a large group of low vision patients are reviewed. This chapter then explores the issue of how individual patient preferences must be factored into the outcome measures to determine the utility of functional improvements from vision rehabilitation. A theoretical framework for incorporating the utility of individual vision rehabilitation outcomes is offered and its application to functional outcome data is demonstrated.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Health Informatics', 'Psychometrics', 'Health Administration']"

Other than typical structural failure mechanisms, tensegrity may fail due to slacking of cables or buckling of bars. Real-life tensegrities are an assemblage of component modules. Large tensegrities require excessive computation for model-based structural health monitoring (SHM), which may sometimes make the problem ill-posed. Instead of the entire domain, only a substructure can be investigated explicitly. Substructures decouple the structure into independent components that can be monitored individually, provided the sub-domain interface is measured. Yet the integration of substructures within predictor-corrector model-based SHM algorithms needs special investigation from consistency, stability, and accuracy perspectives. To consider system uncertainties Bayesian filtering-based SHM approaches have been employed in this study. The need for interface measurement has been circumvented through an output injection approach. To increase computational efficiency, the domain decomposition approach is coupled with an interacting filtering-based approach that employs Ensemble Kalman filter (for state estimation) within an envelope of Particle filter (for health parameter estimation). This facilitates simultaneous estimation of state and parameters while enabling full parallelization capability. The proposed approach is tested on a six-stage tensegrity tower made of component simplex modules.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-07258-1_26,en,A Kriging Approach to Model Updating for Damage Detection,OriginalPaper,"For complex or large structures, the model updating process can be long and tedious and numerical methods can be computationally expensive. Hence, practitioners and researchers often resort to meta-modelling techniques when large problems are met. Even so, traditional methodologies, such as the Efficient Global Optimisation, can be slow and give sub-optimal results. This work proposes a new methodology for the model updating of numerical systems based on a novel Kriging approach for the scope of damage detection and quantification. The framework proposed is based on a global-local optimisation strategy recently developed by the authors, the refined Efficient Global Optimisation, herein used to tweak finite element models’ parameters to match the modal data extracted from a numerical system by using the residuals of the modified total modal assurance criterion. The main advantage to existing direct optimisation and meta-modelling frameworks is the more efficient use of computational effort for higher dimensional problems, which is verified with the use of a numerical system.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

In this respect, Seismic Structural Health Monitoring (S 2 HM) can support decision-makers by providing real-time information on the structural condition. Nevertheless, S 2 HM information comes with a cost, and decision-makers have to decide if installing this type of system is worthy before the information is collected. In this paper, the benefit of S 2 HM in post-earthquake emergency management is assessed through the Value of Information (VoI) from Bayesian decision analysis. The VoI can be intended as the expected reduction in management costs resulting from monitoring information. If the VoI is higher than the cost of the monitoring system, the manager should install it. The methodology is applied to an exemplary building in a seismic area. It is demonstrated and discussed in the paper that the value of S 2 HM is strongly influenced by the decision scenario considered by the decision-maker. Specifically, it is shown that the VoI is particularly high when the S 2 HM information prevents unnecessary building evacuation and related losses of functionality.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

This chapter addresses medical quality, and other quality aspects are discussed in other chapters. Every hospital should give patients access to quality data on the hospital website, so that patients can use this information when deciding which hospital to use. Indicators of medical quality are categorized into three types; structure, process, and outcome indicators. Structure includes factors such as number of beds, if there are specialized units in oncology, neurology, etc. Process indicators refer to documents and training standards. What matters the most for patients is data on health outcome, which is about change in health and complications to different treatments. Surprisingly few hospitals provide data on health outcome. There is a trend in the USA that outcome data is a requirement to get contract with health providers. Every clinical leader must be continuously updated on outcomes, including complication rates in their own unit, and must take action whenever needed. The hospital director must have access to outcome data for the entire hospital and how each clinical unit is performing.","['Business and Management', 'Health Care Management', 'Organization', 'Business Strategy/Leadership', 'Practice and Hospital Management']"

In early 2020, elective surgeries were canceled to preserve resources for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study attempts to measure the effect of mandated operating room shutdowns on TTS in patients with breast cancer. Patients and Methods This multicenter retrospective study compares 51 patients diagnosed with breast cancer at four public hospitals from January to June 2020 with 353 patients diagnosed from January 2017 to June 2018. Demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment regimens, and TTS for patients were statistically compared using parametric, nonparametric, and Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. Results Across all centers, there was a non-statistically significant increase in median TTS from 59 days in the pre-COVID period to 65 days during COVID ( p = 0.9). There was, however, meaningful variation across centers. At center A, the median TTS decreased from 57 to 51 days, center C’s TTS decreased from 83 to 64 days, and in center D, TTS increased from 42 to 129 days. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model for the pre-COVID versus COVID period effect on TTS, center was an important confounding variable, with notable differences for centers C and D compared with the referent category of center A ( p = 0.04, p = 0.006). Conclusion Data suggest that, while mandated operating room shutdowns did not result in an overall statistically significant delay in TTS, there were important differences between centers, indicating that, even in a unified multicenter public hospital system, COVID-19 may have resulted in delayed and potentially disparate care.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery']"

In times of pandemic crises like COVID-19, IoT and sensors play a critical role in the medical industry. Sensors and IoT-based health care gadgets have emerged as saviors for humanity in the face of resource shortage. Pulse oximeters are one such instrument that has been utilized widely during pandemics. Since a long time, pulse oximeters have been used to measure crucial body functions such as saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO 2 ) and pulse rate. They have been utilized to detect vital signs in patients in order to diagnose cardiac trouble early. However, oximeters have been widely utilized to detect SPO 2 levels in persons during the current pandemic. People are being attacked by the COVID-19, which is silently destroying their lungs, causing pneumonia and lowering oxygen levels to dangerously low levels. We propose a strategy in this study for detecting possibly vulnerable individuals by classifying them using data obtained from pulse oximeters.

EMI employs a high-frequency range and is a promising method to be used for the evaluation of lightweight structures. This study focuses on understanding the comparative sensitivity of different actuators to damage presence in additively manufactured (AM) polymer structures. An acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plate printed with horizontal layup was used for the investigation, where 2 PZT and 1 MFC actuators were fixed on the surface. Initially, damage was simulated by moving small magnets away from the actuators on both sides of the plate. Further, an impact damage was created at the center of the plate to compare the damage sensitivity of the three actuators. While both actuator types have shown a good damage sensitivity and coverage, a better sensitivity was observed in the case of the MFC actuator, as compared to PZTs. The attained damage index results of impedance and conductance are promising for the assessment of AM polymer structures.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

It can be costly and difficult to detect, traditionally requiring hours of assessment by a trained clinical. Recently, machine learning models have been trained to screen for depression with patient voice recordings collected during an interview with a virtual agent. To engage the patient in a conversation and increase the quantity of responses, the virtual interviewer asks a series of follow-up questions. However, asking fewer questions would reduce the time burden of screening for the participant. We, therefore, assess if these follow-up questions have a tangible impact on the performance of deep learning models for depression classification. Specifically, we study the effect of including the vocal and transcribed replies to one, two, three, four, five, or all follow-up questions in the depression screening models. We notably achieve this using unimodal and multimodal pre-trained transfer learning models. Our findings reveal that follow-up questions can help increase F1 scores for the majority of the interview questions.

Current methods like interviews and rating scales can be cumbersome, sometimes ineffective, and oftentimes infrequently administered. Even ecological momentary assessments, when used alone, are susceptible to many of the same limitations and still require active participation from the subject. Passive, continuous, frictionless, and ubiquitous means of recording and analyzing mood and cognition obviate the need for more frequent and lengthier doctor’s visits, can help identify misdiagnoses, and would potentially serve as an early warning system to better manage medication adherence and prevent hospitalizations. Activity trackers and smartwatches have long provided exactly such a tool for evaluating physical fitness. What if smartphones, voice assistants, and eventually Internet of Things devices and ambient computing systems could similarly serve as fitness trackers for the brain, without imposing any additional burden on the user?

The system was conceived, designed, implemented and embedded on Raspberry Pi 3 (RP). With the need for reliability and information being provided in real time (IoT), RP has tightly integrated into the SHM field. To accomplish that, we developed an acquisition system based on Pmod IA (AD5933) along with the multiplex 4066, used to switch among the piezoelectric transducers. Furthermore, a real-time web application was developed to manage the acquisition system, integrate hardware with software and store the data collected in a dedicated NoSQL database. To perform excitation and get the structural response signals, experiments were carried out based on the electromechanical impedance technique by using three PZTs glued into an aluminium structure. Sinusoidal excitation signals, ranging from 20 kHz to 30 kHz with an amplitude of 2 V, were applied to the host structure. Overall, the reference system presented higher sensitivity for the RMSD metric, whilst the proposed system showed more relevance for damage detection via CCDM.

As well known, Italy boasts a unique cultural-historical heritage of monuments and archeological sites that need to be managed, particularly in a multi-hazard prone area like our country. A really appealing technique is represented by the advanced multi-temporal differential interferometry synthetic aperture radar (MT-DInSAR), which has been developed and applied in different fields in the last twenty years. The exploitation of such techniques in the monitoring and structural assessment of cultural heritage is still an open issue even if the first applications available in literature show promising potentialities. In this paper the general framework for structural monitoring and assessment previously proposed by the authors, is applied to the complex building San Michele in Rome (Italy). In particular, COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) ascending and descending datasets are collected and processed applying the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) method obtaining deformation time series and mean velocity maps of the persistent scatterers located in the investigated area, for both geometry acquisitions. Finally, different techniques useful for assessing the structural behavior and monitoring of constructions are applied and critically discussed.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Models using guided waves can provide information from both time and frequency domains to make themselves accurate and robust. Probabilistic SHM models, which have the ability to account for uncertainties, are developed when decision confidence intervals are of interest. However, most existing active-sensing guided-wave methods are based on the requirement that a relatively large data set can be collected, and thus are not feasible when data collection is restricted by time or environmental conditions. Meanwhile, simulation results, though lack of accuracy compared to real world data, are easier to obtain. In this context, models that incorporate data from different sources have the potential to embrace the accuracy of experimental data and the convenience of simulated data without the necessity of large and, potentially costly experimental, data sets. The goal of this work is to introduce and assess a probabilistic multi-fidelity Gaussian process regression framework for damage state estimation via the use of both experimental and simulated guided waves. The main differences from previous works include the combination of damage-sensitive features (damage indices; DIs) extracted from experimental and numerical sources, and a relatively small amount of real-world data. The proposed model is validated using data from two sources. The experimental data is collected from a piezoelectric sensor network attached to an aluminum plate under varying crack sizes while the simulated data comes from multi-physics finite element model (FEM) simulations with the same specifications.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Prison design is a social phenomenon, and as such, its actualisation is the result of the interaction of competing interests of different entities. Planners’ success in achieving the expected results of prison modernisationmodernization programsprogrammes seem to be sensitive to the organisational purposes, missions, and structures of prison services, making it harder to identify which phenomenon (or phenomena) influence the results. The same architectural characteristics of prisons, therefore, can have different outcomes depending on the geo-historical context of the prison system in different countries. Using a case study approach and critical realism this chapter investigates how and why the results of Chile's largest and most costly prison reform programprogramme did not meet stakeholders’ expectations. After reviewing the theoretical approach, the chapter explores the architectonical and historical features of the Chilean case, showing the priorities and concerns of both designers and prison authorities. Additionally, by drawing on Critical Realism and Organised Hypocrisy Theory, it will offer a plausible explanation of the causal mechanisms behind organisational patterns, how they work, and what can be done to unlock evolution.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

Developing sensing and data analytics to assess the structural condition of the targeted systems is crucial. Traditional contact-based techniques may produce inconsistent results and are labor-intensive to be considered a valid alternative for monitoring large-scale structures such as bridges, large buildings, and wind turbines. Advancements in image-processing algorithms made techniques such as three-dimensional digital image correlation (3D-DIC), infrared thermography (IRT), motion magnification (MM), and structure from motion (SfM) appealing tools for structural health monitoring and non-destructive testing. Besides, as those techniques are implemented within unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the measurement process is expedited while reducing interference with the targeted structure. This paper summarizes the research experience performed at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. The results of these activities show that the combination of autonomous flight with 3D-DIC, IRT, and SfM can provide precious insights into the structural conditions of the inspected systems while reducing downtime and costs.

Static and dynamic loads from vehicles and pedestrians influence the instantaneous responses of bridges, while thermal loads from daily and seasonal temperature variations influence bridge long-term responses. Vision-based monitoring (VBM) is an emerging non-contact, non-destructive monitoring approach. It utilizes cameras to capture sequential images of the structure under load and suitable image processing algorithms for target tracking. VBM has shown promising accuracy in static and dynamic response measurements of bridges, however, the evidence of its accuracy in thermal response measurements is limited. This research illustrates the results of laboratory experiments implementing VBM for thermal response measurements. Thermal responses of a laboratory truss are monitored with VBM and contact sensors such as thermocouples and linear variable differential transformers (LVDT). Cyclic temperature loads are applied to the truss to simulate daily temperature variations. The truss is monitored with GoPro cameras and contact sensors. Measured response trends by VBM and LVDT are comparable, indicating the accuracy of VBM to measure thermal responses. Thermal responses measured by VBM are higher than those of LVDT, signifying requirement for measurement resolution enhancement. The measurement resolution of VBM is 0.099 mm/°C and LVDT1 is 0.041 mm/°C respectively. This discrepancy can be attributed to non-identical targets of VBM and LVDT, resolution of the camera, efficiency of the feature tracking algorithm and robustness of LVDT output. This case study illustrates the feasibility and challenges of VBM for thermal response measurement.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The main challenges of WSNs are time synchronization, transmission of large amounts of data, and energy consumption. In this paper, autocovariance functions (ACFs) are estimated in all sensor nodes. Strict time synchronization is not necessary, because cross-correlations are not utilized. The measurement period must be long for a sufficient accuracy, but the number of samples in the transmitted ACFs is much smaller. The ACFs from all sensor nodes are transmitted to the base station for centralized data processing. Spatiotemporal correlation can be utilized, because for a stationary random process the ACFs have the same form as the free decay of the system. The covariance matrix is estimated using the training data from the undamaged structure under different environmental conditions. An extreme value statistics control chart is designed to detect damage. A numerical experiment was performed by simulating a bridge deck under stationary random excitation and variable environmental conditions. The excitation or environmental variables were not measured. Damage was a crack in a steel girder. Nonsimultaneous sampling of the WSN was simulated by selecting the starting time of the measurement randomly in each sensor node.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Drawing on social movement theory and EU Gender Studies, I outline the specific obstacles that the collective mobilisation of sex workers confronts at EU level, including those posed by the EU’s own civil society interface. In turn, engaging critically with the unique approach to unmaking security proposed by Claudia Aradau, I argue, first, that while she is right in stating that the principles of universality and equality can be reclaimed from within liberal political institutions, and not just against them, she is wrong in identifying such principles in the notion of work , and thus sex work as having the potential to desecuritise trafficking in women for sexual exploitation at EU level. Secondly, I argue that Aradau adheres to what Chris Rossdale calls a hegemonic ontology of agency , which makes her disavow the desecuritising potential of the advocacy that sex worker organisations engage in at a distance from the state. Drawing on post-anarchism theories, I conclude, that it is in the prefigurative forms of direct action and anarchistic forms of subjective resistance that sex workers enact, in the public demonstrations they develop as whore-walks , in particular, that their true desecuritising potential lies.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Politics and Gender', 'European Politics', 'International Security Studies']"

Through reweighting of synaptic strengths, the nervous system can remodel itself, giving rise to durable memories that create the biological basis for mental function. In healthy individuals, synaptic plasticity undergoes characteristic developmental and aging trajectories. Dysfunctional plasticity, in turn, underlies a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, schizophrenia, addiction, and posttraumatic stress disorder. From a mechanistic standpoint, synaptic plasticity spans the gamut of spatial and temporal scales, from microseconds to the lifespan, from microns to the entire nervous system. With the numbers and strengths of synapses changing on such wide scales, there is an important need to develop measurement techniques with complimentary sensitivities and a growing number of approaches are now being harnessed for this purpose.

Adhesive bonds are a lightweight option to transfer loads between different materials, and failure prediction of such adhesive joints is of great importance. This research is concerned with static damage detection of lap shear specimens with Structural Health Monitoring methods. The specimen design is derived from single-lap shear test specimens according to ASTM D5868 , with one joining partner made of additively manufactured Ti6Al4V and the other one made of a carbon-fibre reinforced polymer laminate. The adhesive layer consists of the matrix material of the carbon-fibre reinforced polymer laminate. In order to enhance the lap shear, the additively manufactured part is printed in a comb-shape and on a number of specimens, pins are printed to yield additional interlocking of the parts. For assessment purposes, several different Structural Health Monitoring methods are available. Of these, Acoustic Emission measurements are evaluated in detail for this study. When the crack extends during linear increasing the load, acoustic waves propagate through the joining partners. To enable their detection, a piezoelectric element is bonded onto the surface of the Ti6Al4V adherend. The Acoustic Emission results show hits which are well separated from a noise floor, facilitating the use of Acoustic Emission for this application. Damages can be detected earlier than by evaluating strain changes with a Digital Image Correlation system.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The evidence for this is present in the slow generation of empirical research during and in the aftermath, which could possibly generate new theoretical means to understand what this may mean for the generations to come. Major social change is underway. Almost every facet of social life is being rewritten right before our very eyes. The lockdowns, social distancing, and other measures implemented to ‘control’ the spread of Covid-19 have revolutionised the functioning of political and social institutions and have altered the platforms of social interactions and human relations. Yet the sublime ideological alignment of governments, the media, and law enforcement agencies in favour of these measures has radically polarised society as well as intensified present inequalities while simultaneously creating new ones in the process. All the while, all manner of historical , political , and social , as well as, importantly, medical context has been absent in the face of all this. Unless it moves quickly, criminology could well miss an opportunity to show its true multidisciplinary colours .

Today there are three dominant schools of thought which consider how evidence can be used to inform policy outcomes; political science, decision-making theory, and policy studies. Political science emphasises the design of evidence, through classical models of social enquiry, as fundamental to ensuring political impact (Green 2005). Decision-science or decision-making theory emphasises the processes of deliberation and contestation through which decisions are reached thereby highlighting potential entry points at which evidence can be presented (Goldie et al. 2006). Meanwhile policy studies emphasises the process of policy formulation, with models ranging from decade-long cycles, to messy non-linear processes of coalitions weighing-up evidence inputs, beliefs, and political influences to design and advocate for interventions (Sabatier 1988; Cairney 2013). The most expansive literature on evidence to policy-uptake stems from the field of policy studies referred to as Evidence-Based or Evidence-Informed Policy (EBP / EIP), which has borrowed heavily from the evidence-based practice movement which started in medical research.","['Environment', 'Sustainable Development', 'Social Policy', 'Public Policy']"

Within the populations of interest, it is useful to assess the similarity of structures, in order to form communities and networks; i.e., to establish clusters. By doing so, it is possible to infer whether transfer learning is likely to be applicable across a population. To address this, structures are represented in graphical form via irreducible element (IE) models or attributed graphs (AG), that encompass the topology, material properties and geometry of the structures. Kernel-based methods – also known as graph kernels – can then be applied to these IEs and AGs to assess the similarities within the population. In this paper, a number of comparisons are made between graphical representations of structures at different levels of resolution; these vary from assessing similarity at a purely topological level, to an increase in complexity, where discrete and continuous node labels are evaluated via graph kernels.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

However, the advancements in modelling pose challenges in the model analysis process for understanding the complex effects of input factors, especially when it comes to offering concrete policies for improving system outcomes. In this work, we propose a revised micro-dynamic analysis method that adopts advanced artificial intelligence methods to enhance the model interpretation and to facilitate group-specific policy-making. It strengthens the explanation power of the conventional micro-dynamic analysis by eliminating ambiguity in the result interpretation and enabling a causal interpretation of a target phenomenon across subgroups. We applied our method to understand an agent-based model that evaluates the effects of a long-term care scheme on access to care. Our findings showed that the method can suggest policies for improving the equity of access more efficiently than the conventional scenario analysis.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The executive branch, already structurally concentrating in its hand’s substantial power via the Doctrine of Necessity, imposed because of the country’s ongoing ethnic conflict and division and the country’s presidential system, was strengthened further as it was effectively ruling by decrees without sufficient parliamentary scrutiny. Opposition parties kept a low profile and avoided to openly confront the government on the core issues, restricting criticism to peripheral matters and questioning the form of measures rather than the policy substance. At the same time, social dialogue was not suspended, and trade unions and employers were invited by the government to submit their views on aspects of the situation relevant to the economy and the labour market. Overall, no major change in policy direction has been evident so far and conservative rhetoric is widespread among government officials.

Among the critical aspects that can compromise the effectiveness of such SHM systems in the identification of structural anomalies, the operating conditions (temperature, loads, vibration, corrosion, etc.) require a particular attention.

Thus, data from a similar source structure can be used to train a classifier that generalises to a target structure. Conventional unsupervised domain adaptation methods would assume that the data available from both structures belongs to the same number of damage-states or disparate environmental conditions; however, in practical scenarios, the data in the target structure may pertain to a subset of the available classes in the source structure; this is a partial domain adaptation problem. Conventional domain adaptation methods are prone to performance degradation in this scenario. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel statistic alignment method and instance-weighting strategy. A numerical population of structures demonstrates that these methods facilitate transfer where a number of state-of-the-art domain adaptation algorithms cannot.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Development of diagnostic methodologies is commonly realised on simplified sample structures with assumptions that methodologies can be adapted for application to realistic aircraft structures under in-service conditions. Yet such actual applications are not conducted. In this work, we study the development of diagnostic methodologies to training structures and their application to dissimilar testing structures. A heterogeneous population is considered, consisting of single-stiffener composite panels for methodology development and training and a multi-stiffener composite panel for application and testing. Characteristics as its composite material, lay-up, and temperature condition are constant while topologies and applied loads differ between the dissimilar structures. Damage in the structural panels is monitored on multiple diagnostic levels using a variety of structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques, including acoustic emission and distributed strain sensing. Specifically, we develop diagnostic methods for localising and monitoring disbond growth after impact using strain data collected during fatigue testing of multiple single-stiffener panels and apply these for disbond monitoring in an upscaled version of a multi-stiffener panel. In this manner, this study aids in the maturement and application of SHM methodologies to realistic aircraft structures.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Because of being so well adapted and resilient, insect biochemistry and physiology has coevolved to resist the most stressful of abiotic and biotic factors. This has led to an array of defensive chemicals tailormade to target encountered biological dangers such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, predators, etc. Insects as potential cures has been recognized since times of yore, but unfortunately this native knowledge has not yet been translated into pharmaceutical successes to the extent desired.

Temperature effects were examined by measurements in a climatic chamber. Sensors were mounted on the skin of a CFRP sandwich structure which was exposed to temperatures from −50 to +50 °C with the step of 10 ℃. Both A0 and S0 modes were analyzed in the frequency range of 50–300 kHz. Time of flight delays indicating a velocity decrease with increasing temperature were confirmed for the corresponding modes. However, with decreasing temperature, frequency shifts towards higher frequencies were observed, which caused difficulties for dispersion curve determination. Damage–type signals were demonstrated by impact-induced damage. Time of flight change was examined in relation to the temperature and damage. Temperature affected time delay/time advance increased with the signal length while damage influenced only some part of the signal. These findings enabled to distinguish the cause of the time of arrival change. Therefore, false alarms regarding damage detection are likely to be reduced.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

An Empirical Study on Dutch Consumers,OriginalPaper,"This research investigates if consumers were less price sensitive to life necessities during the COVID-19 pandemic via a demand modeling system. Consumers’ price sensitivity was explicitly quantified by the price elasticity of demand. Consumer behavior in nine categories of products considered as life necessities were studied in two non-overlapping time periods: a year before the onset of the COVID pandemic and a year following the initial panic buying caused by the declaration of the COVID pandemic. The changes in price elasticity of demand between the two periods across the nine product categories were determined from the weekly sales data of a Dutch retailer. Using the proposed demand modeling system applied to available data, it was empirically found that the majority of essential food products were price inelastic, while the majority of non-food products were price elastic during the COVID period. Among the nine product categories, four categories were identified to have significantly different elasticities across the two time periods, while eight categories were observed to have practically smaller magnitudes in elasticities. These insights not only prove the usefulness of the proposed demand modeling system, but also provide valuable theoretical and managerial implications for retail business practitioners, particularly in pricing and inventory planning.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Therefore, this article evaluates the current state of utilising deep learning in the construction management tasks to enable researchers to determine the capabilities of current solutions and find research gaps to carry out more research to bridge revealed knowledge and practice gaps. First, the scientometric analysis is conducted for 181 articles to assess the density of publications on different topics of deep learning-based construction management applications. After that, a thematic and gap analysis is conducted to analyse the contributions and limitations of key published articles in each area of application. The scientometric analysis indicates four main applications of deep learning in construction management: automating progress monitoring, automating safety warning for workers, managing construction equipment, and integrating IoT with deep learning to collect data from the site automatically. The thematic and gap analysis refers to many successful cases of deep learning in automating site management tasks. However, more validations are recommended to test developed solutions, as well as additional research is required to consider practitioners’ and workers’ perspectives to implement mentioned applications in their daily tasks. This article enables researchers to directly find the research gaps in the developed solutions and develop more workable applications to bridge revealed gaps. Accordingly, this will be reflected in speeding the digital construction transformation, a strategy worldwide.

The incompatibility of these roles and the difficulties felt when trying to balance these spheres can lead to work-family and family-work conflict and consequently to feelings of guilt. These consequences can negatively affect individuals regarding their well-being and career satisfaction. Through a sample of 180 participants, 107 women and 73 men, aged between 21 and 71 years (M = 38.57; SD = 9.83), this quantitative study aims to analyze the influence of work-family conflict and guilt on well-being and career satisfaction. The results show that conflict is a predictor of guilt and both influence well-being but have no influence on career satisfaction. This reinforces the importance of developing family-friendly practices and policies by organizations, aimed at increasing the well-being and satisfaction of their human capital.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Occupational Medicine/Industrial Medicine', 'Industrial and Organizational Psychology']"

This paper focuses on the thermal cycling durability of PZT piezoelectric transducers bonded on a Carbon Fiber Reinforce Polymer (CFRP) composite plate. The temperature cycles are set to be representative of the thermal loadings that the structure of a launcher could experience under a thermal barrier: limited number of cycles (<10) of short duration (<10 min) and high temperatures for thermoset-matrix composites (150 $$^\circ $$ ∘ C). The heating is generated using a CO2 laser in order to obtain the steep thermal ramps (60 $$^\circ $$ ∘ C/min) and gradients through the plate thickness to best reproduce flight conditions. To our knowledge, very few research studies have been carried out so far on the resistance of SHM systems under such environment. The degradation of the system formed by the composite plate, the adhesive and the PZT transducer is studied, in comparison with the state of reference before cycling, with three different approaches. First, electromechanical impedance is measured during the entire thermal cycling. Then the functionality of a guided wave SHM system is evaluated based on the emission and reception of Lamb waves between PZTs attached to the surface of the plate. Finally, Laser vibrometry is used to provide a mapping of the emitted Lamb waves propagation and to identify possible debondings or changes of amplitudes of waveforms after the thermal cycles.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

In fact, WHO declared it as pandemic in March 2020. The adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be originated from interaction between several hosts, which makes it a potential zoonotic agent. Regarding the survival of virus on the environment, it is important to assess the period of infectivity, which differs among different surfaces. This chapter highlights the viability of virus on different contaminated surfaces, also focusing on metagenomic interactions. To investigate the potential directions for the evolution of this pandemic in the future, SARS-CoV-2 requires a reliable tool to access crucial details regarding the adaptation and evolution of the virus in the environment. Bioinformatic tools play an important role in identifying the similarity and variations in the Open Reading Frames (ORFs) of the viral genomes to elucidate the phytogenic relationships. In this regard, this chapter discusses about recent advances in bioinformatic tools to track the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the soil and aquatic ecosystem. New technologies are coming into existence with a new aspect of solving some social problems. Hence, in this work a reliable in silico tool for metagenomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the environment has been discussed. Overall, this study tries to shed further light on aspect that could help to understand different types of robotics and techniques used for soil and aquatic system, with the main aim of accessing to relevant details on SARS-CoV-2 in the environment.","['Environment', 'Environmental Chemistry', 'Waste Management/Waste Technology', 'Agriculture', 'Pollution, general', 'Applied Microbiology']"

The data collected by satellites are processed to obtain time histories of displacements through which phenomena such as settlements at the base of a structure can be identified and followed over time. This article provides a general overview of SAR satellite monitoring of structures and infrastructures, with a specific focus on DInSAR techniques (“Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar”). A data processing technique is presented to analyze DInSAR displacements to gain insight into the structural behavior. The case study investigated in this paper is the Palatino bridge in Rome, Italy. The SAR satellite data are acquired by COSMO-SkyMed of the Italian Space Agency and consist of displacements calculated during an acquisition period between 2010 and 2019. SAR satellite data allows to study the structural behavior in the vertical and longitudinal (i.e., along the bridge axis) directions.

In this framework, the increasing number of bridge collapses has progressively fueled the interest towards the development of reliable monitoring strategies, able to efficiently ensure real-time bridge assessment and early-stage damage detection. To this aim, recent advancements in sensor technologies and data science have strongly encouraged the use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Within the unsupervised learning context, this paper proposes an innovative convolutional autoencoder-based damage detection technique applied to the Z24 benchmark bridge. Firstly, raw acceleration sequences of user-defined length are converted into images using the Gramian Angular Field Approach (GAF). Then, during the training, the model learns how to correctly reconstruct healthy data acquired by SHM systems. The trained network is afterwards tested with unknown data and the mean absolute error (MAE), considered as a damage-sensitive feature, is adopted to quantify the errors between the original input and reconstructed output. Finally, damage detection is performed when the percentage of damaged sequences within a pre-defined macro-sequence exceeds a properly fixed threshold. Results prove that the implemented ML algorithm, working at the level of single sensor, is effective to enable continuous assessment of large-scale monitored bridges as new data is collected, involving limited computational efforts.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Here we outline the application of metabolomics to understanding risk, treatment, and prognosis of GDM, and where possible the utility of metabolomics in understanding subtypes of GDM. Studies of metabolomics using blood collected during pregnancy indicate that GDM risk and treatment is associated with altered levels of amino acids, long-chain fatty acids, and glycolytic intermediates. Further, use of multiple metabolites in conjunction with clinical factors has a better value over clinical factors alone or a single metabolite, for predicting risk of T2D among women who had GDM. Although these data provide novel insights, the application of metabolomics in guiding GDM treatment, monitoring of adherence, and evaluation of prognosis has yet to be fully realized.","['Biomedicine', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Pharmacology/Toxicology']"

For example, PP and PRS are both rooted in the philosophies of positivism (which assumes all knowledge must be empirically verified using the scientific method) and naturalism (which assumes there are no realities beyond the natural, material world). Both PP and PRS have much to offer society and the scientific community, but their historic roots in positivistic naturalism currently limit this potential, both in terms of concepts and methods. In this chapter, we argue that for PP and the PRS to coevolve and flourish, they must transcend their perhaps often unaware—but staunch—commitment to positivistic naturalism. In particular, the fields of PP and PRS need to draw inclusively and meaningfully from the methodological, conceptual, and experiential insights of philosophical and religious traditions. Doing so will help PP and PRS broaden the scope of what they each consider meaningful, possible, desirable, and transformative.

For guided wave-based SHM it is not possible to evaluate the system performance without taking into account the target structure and applied system parameters. This range of variables would result in countless measurements. Factors like environmental conditions, structural dependencies and wave characteristics demand novel solutions for performance analysis of SHM systems compared to those relying on classical non-destructive evaluation. Such novel approaches typically require model-assisted investigations which may not only help to explain and understand performance assessment results but also enable complete studies without costly experiments. Within this contribution, a multi input multi output approach using a sparse transducer array permanently installed on a composite structure to excite and sense guided waves is considered. Firstly, the method and the analysis of path-based performance assessment are presented considering an open-access dataset from the Open Guided Wave platform. Then, a performance analysis of a guided wave-based SHM system using Probability of Detection is presented. To explain some unexpected results, the model-assisted investigations are used to understand the physical phenomena of wave propagation in the test specimen including the interaction with damage.

Traditional methods of SHM are time consuming and cost ineffective. In addition, civil structures such as dams and high raised buildings are burdensome and risky to inspect manually, especially after a natural disaster. Crack signals the beginning of failure for any structure. Most of the existing methods largely deal with only the detection of cracks. Proposed work concentrates on segmentation, classification, and subsequent detection of cracks based on pattern i.e., Linear vs branching, apart from the single and multiple cracks. The image dataset was obtained from real-time visual inspections. This study is significant because a branching crack shows greater structural stress than a linear crack. Furthermore, results quantify the damage in the image using instance segmentation techniques.

Natural and man-made calamities have ravaged Sri Lanka on several occasions, disproportionately affecting the socially excluded and marginalized people. When it comes to the treatment of marginalized people in disasters, the primary rule is that everyone, regardless of their differences, should have the same privileges and rights. However, there has been fewer study of the literature on the extent of social exclusion experienced by Sri Lanka’s excluded population during disasters. Building disaster-resilient communities has become a top priority for crisis management organizations around the world in recent years, as resilient communities are more likely to incur less losses and recover more swiftly in the case of a disaster. To improve a society’s resilience, however, one must first create a baseline, or a starting point from which to compare communities. This research uses a Systematic Literature Review to synthesize the context of marginalization during disasters in Sri Lanka, drawing on examples and models from other countries. Data was acquired utilizing two databases, as well as scanning the gray literature. The PRISMA model was used for the screening process of the literature. Studies conducted on marginalization in disasters, published in English, were selected by the reviewer. Furthermore, the VOS viewer data mining tool was used for developing a network map of keywords of the selected literatures to identify the most investigated areas. Out of 2072 of total articles published between 2016 and 2021, 37 articles have been included and reviewed in this study. In order to define a socially excluded marginalized community during disasters, six significant parameters of marginalization were eventually identified. The problem describes how marginalization accelerates as a result of various overlapping vulnerabilities, and how these marginalized groups are underrepresented in the disaster cycle and decision-making processes as a result of disaster planning, impact, response, and recovery.","['Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Sustainable Development', 'Building Materials', 'Building Construction and Design']"

Modern fleets often comprise of clusters of similarly deteriorating assets, due to customisation or diversity in their operational settings. As such, the prevalent techniques of using a single fleet-wide model or independent cluster-specific models for modelling the times-to-failures are associated with high bias or high variance respectively. The problem of high variance is especially prominent for the asset clusters with where relatively fewer failures are observed. This paper proposes that statistical hierarchical modelling systematically mitigates the problem of high variance for the clusters with sparse data using shared higher level models for the cluster-specific model parameters. A hierarchical model of the Weibull density functions is shown in this chapter as an example because of the popularity of the Weibull distributions in reliability applications. Failure trajectories from a fleet of simulated turbofans are used herewith for the experiments that compare the advantage of the proposed hierarchical model over independent or fleet-wide models for modelling the observed times-to-failures.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The Structural Engineering Community is nowadays employing Electro-Mechanical Impedance (EMI) technique on a wide range for monitoring the health of structures. EMI technique involves the use of Piezoelectric (PZT) patches bonded to the host structure and also instruments such as Impedance analyzer/LCR meter, Wired/Wireless connections, etc. The change in conductance/impedance/susceptance signatures in comparison with the healthy signatures defines the presence of damage. The experimental arrangement in this regard resembles the impedimental system approach. So, substitutable modeling and analysis with the help of simulation are preferable. In this research, a beam-column joint has been modeled in ANSYS 19.2 software. After analysis, the joint has been monitored for baseline (healthy) results on the basis of the simulated EMI technique for health inspection. After getting the baseline conductance and susceptance signatures, the beam-column joint has been formed with a crack modeled on the joint. The fracture analyzed model was then monitored in the same way as a healthy model with the help of the PZT patch. The conductance signature so obtained was then compared with the baseline (healthy) signature, the change in which identified the presence of a crack on the joint. Root mean squared deviation (RMSD) values have been calculated for computing the change in conductance values for respective frequency ranges.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Construction Management', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering']"

It was adopted by the Swedish Parliament in 1997, and due to the success of lowering the number of deaths in traffic crashes significantly, it has become an inspiration to road safety strategies in countries and cities all over the world. An important factor as to why Vision Zero diffuses is the incorporation of the vision in reports and strategies from international intergovernmental organizations and through the work of nongovernmental organizations. The development of finding a common global strategy for road safety has been an ongoing process for many years, and the purpose of this chapter is to map the role of Vision Zero in this global development process. This is performed by studying the integration of Vision Zero in the road safety work and strategies of key international intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations. The chapter also contains an account of possible opportunities and advantages of working with Vision Zero as a tool on the global level as well as the criticism towards the approach. This chapter discusses the content of what is being diffused, why it is diffused, who is diffusing, and how it is diffusing. The material consists of key global policy documents and 29 semi-structured interviews with senior experts working with road safety on a global level. The main conclusions are that Vision Zero is a well-established global road safety policy program and a road safety philosophy integrated into both the work and texts of the major intergovernmental organizations working with road safety. There is a widespread opinion that Vision Zero and other safe system approaches constitute a paradigm shift in global road safety work. It is regarded as an innovative and inspiring policy based primarily on its ethical approach. It is also regarded as a coherent policy program and rests firmly upon years of progress and experience. Even though many of the respondents are positive towards the ethical base and the systematic approach, there are still those who argue that Vision Zero cannot be used as a policy tool, at least not in low- and middle-income countries. It is obvious that Vision Zero is not interpreted and reproduced in the same way in all contexts, but the question is if that is part of a natural transformation process leading to new interpretations or if it is a problem for the Vision Zero trademark.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

Recently, these compounds have received more attention due to their diverse role in providing protection against various types of pathogenic and non-pathogenic diseases. These miraculous bioactive compounds also pursue pharmacological activities against several microbial pathogens and are also known to exhibit antidiabetic, antipyretic, anticancerous, antidiuretic, and antioxidant properties. Some bioactive compounds extracted from plants such as phenolic compounds, anthocyanidins, flavonoids, tannins, and flavones are found in significantly high concentration in the biosphere, and certain others are present in less amount but their pharmacological as well as commercial importance cannot be denied. The activities of bioactive compounds like flavonoids, polyphenols, not only functions to inhibit microbial growth but also they act synergistically with other drugs which make them ideal for alternative cancer remedies. This chapter provides a general insight into secondary metabolites having antimicrobial and anticancerous properties, their plant source, and their mode of actions.","['Chemistry', 'Food Science', 'Food Microbiology', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

To strengthen the interaction of PP and the PRS beyond the traditional boundaries of the West, this chapter explores the current overlap between these two psychology subfields in Africa, Asia, and Oceania. After providing a brief overview of each region, we apply a systematic approach to identify and evaluate research that intersects PP and the PRS in each region. Our search revealed a total of 128 scholarly articles over the last three decades. Topical emphases were classified into three overarching themes: (a) well-being, (b) character strengths and virtues, and (c) positive adaptation. Although recent growth in publication outputs within each region is an encouraging sign for the next wave of research, the quality of the existing empirical evidence is limited by an overreliance on cross-sectional observational studies. We highlight some of the ways that culturally responsive cross-pollination of PP and the PRS could benefit people living in Africa, Asia, and Oceania. We also offer suggestions for broadening the scope and enhancing research that intersects both subfields in these culturally and religiously diverse regions.","['Psychology', 'Positive Psychology', 'Religion and Psychology']"

Adverse mental health effects have been associated with this classification of profession to include compassion fatigue, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress (STS), emphasizing a need for preventative measures to moderate these hazards. The present study aimed to identify whether a trauma focused resilience training program, termed The TaskUs Method, could sustain or improve a reviewer's resilience and compassion scores while minimizing the risk of developing secondary traumatic stress (STS) or burnout following repeated exposure. Similar to previous research on adjustment and desensitization, the study found a slight decline in resilience and compassion satisfaction within the first three months of employment. However, unlike previous research, the scores for resilience and compassion remain stable for three months following first exposure within production. Burnout and STS scores remained stable from baseline through three months, indicating that resilience acts as a moderating variable for the effects of content exposure. Additionally, cognitive control was found to predict burnout and STS, meaning individuals with higher cognitive control were less likely to feel overwhelmed and manage stress more effectively. Finally, resilience exhibited the most pertinent influence, as higher resilience scores were found to predict lower scores of burnout and STS and positively predicted compassion satisfaction.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Much effort has been spent during last years on analysis techniques for evaluating metrics correlated to damages’ existence, location and extensions from signals provided by the sensors networks. Deep learning techniques can be a very powerful instrument for signals patterns reconstruction and selection but require the availability of consistent amount of both healthy and damaged structural configuration experimental data sets, with high materials and testing costs, or data reproduced by validated numerical simulations. Within this work explicit finite element simulation of impact damages on composite plates have been used to populate the data sets necessary for deep learning algorithm. The final scope is the detection of delaminations into composites plates for aerospace employ. Numerical time history signals have been collected for both the healthy and unhealthy state of the structure and transformed into RGB images. A convolutional algorithm trained on healthy and damaged signals has been used to identify anomalies in the form of delamination in the structure.

In the more than 20 years since the Vision Zero policy was adopted, it has spread internationally as a model of a public road safety policy (OECD/ITF 2008, 2016; World Health Organization 2017). It is not only in the transport sector that Vision Zero has attracted interest; it has also spread and continues to spread to other sectors of Swedish society such as fire safety, patient safety, occupational accidents, and suicide (Kristianssen et al. 2018). Although, road safety policies and strategies can be developed and adopted by a variety of actors at different levels in the society in a democracy, parliaments have a special position, and it establishes an exclusive legitimacy in the society. According to the Swedish Constitution (Swedish Parliament 2016), all public power proceeds from the people, and the Riksdag (the Swedish Parliament) is the foremost representative of the people. Therefore, this chapter focuses on the Swedish Parliament and the Swedish Government and how road safety, as a public policy, finds its way into public agenda in a competing political environment. The decision to adopt Vision Zero in Sweden was a rather radical change (Belin et al. 2011) of that time safety policy. This chapter examines the political decision-making process that preceded the decision by the Swedish Parliament to adopt the Vision Zero policy in 1997 (Swedish Parliament 1997) and the decision to re-evaluate Vision Zero in 2004 (Swedish Parliament 2004).","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

Given the importance of surgical resection for lung cancer treatment, racial disparities in surgical quality were investigated using a statewide quality collaborative. Methods This retrospective study used data from the Michigan Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons General Thoracic database, which includes data gathered for the Society of Thoracic Surgeons General Thoracic Surgery Database at 17 institutions in Michigan. Adult patients undergoing resection for lung cancer between 2015 and 2021 were included. Propensity score-weighting methodology was used to assess differences in surgical quality, including extent of resection, adequate lymph node evaluation, 30-day mortality, and 30-day readmission rate between white and black patients. Results The cohort included 5073 patients comprising 357 (7%) black and 4716 (93%) white patients. The black patients had significantly higher unadjusted rates of wedge resection than the white patients, but after propensity score-weighting for clinical factors, wedge resection did not differ from lobectomy (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78–1.49; P = 0.67). The black patients had fewer lymph nodes collected (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.77; 95% CI, 0.73–0.81; P < 0.0001) and lymph node stations sampled (IRR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84–0.94; P < 0.0001). The black patients did not differ from the white patients in terms of mortality (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.19–2.34; P = 0.55) or readmission (OR, 0.79; 95 % CI, 0.49–1.27; P = 0.32). The black patients had longer hospital stays (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02–1.14; P = 0.01). Conclusion In a statewide quality collaborative that included high-volume centers, black patients received a less extensive lymph node evaluation, with fewer non-anatomic wedge resections performed, and a more limited lymph node evaluation with lobectomy.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery']"

In addition to the lifelong exposure to environmental EDCs, a transplacental transfer seems to be also an important route. EDCs affect various aspects of the endocrine system leading to endocrine dysfunction. In addition, EDCs are involved in the pathogenesis of cancer in general, and endocrine cancer (EC) in particular. The association of EDCs with EC is mediated through their effects on immune balance, inflammation, and oxidative stress, all of them basic components in carcinogenesis. Besides, some EDCs present with a hormone-like activity acting on nuclear (genomic) and transmembrane receptors (nongenomic) leading to EC. The exact role of EDCs on EC development and/or its evolution is very complicated and has not been fully clarified, due to the complex and multifactorial pathogenesis of cancer and its lifelong manifestation. Although a quite large body of evidence support the role of EDCs in the pathogenesis of various endocrine disorders and some types of EC, there is limited evidence on their role in gonadal and adrenal cancer.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Endocrinology']"

However, academic studies have not fully explored the relationship between poverty and the spatial distribution of environmental pollution, notably in Thailand. Thus, this chapter aims to fill a void in academic research by exploring the implementation of machine learning in the estimation of poverty by training input data from widely available and accessible open source, including environmental pollution and road density. The poverty rate is obtained from the TPMAP website and then clustered into two groups, “high and low,” using hot spot analysis. The Google Earth Engine is used to extract pollution indexes such as carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, nitrogen, and sulfur dioxide, while road density is downloaded from OpenStreetMap. This study compares four different machine learning models: XGboost, lasso, random forest, and ridge regression for poverty estimation. The result of the study reveals that poverty-related areas are highly correlated with environmental pollution. The random forest technique has the best performance prediction among the four methods, with an R 2 of 0.79. Finally, feature importance analysis is used to determine the most influential features in order to assist decision-makers in gaining a better understanding of poverty.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Applications', 'Geography, general', 'Sustainable Development']"

Offshore wind turbines (OWT) are in need of continuous structural health monitoring (SHM) methodologies for scour detection. Reliable detection of scour requires robust selection of structural features to adequately represent the integrity of the OWT. Successful identification of operational modal parameters of OWT is challenging because of the effect of environmental and operational variability (EOV). Therefore, mitigating the effect of EOV is crucial to guarantee that the variability in the extracted features is caused by structural degradation. This work presents a methodology based on stochastic subspace identification enhanced by a clustering technique to identify stable and robust structural modes over time. Gaussian process regression is used to mitigate EOV due to its flexibility and non-parametric nature. Data collected from a control OWT and a scoured OWT in operation over 8-months is used for verification. The results have demonstrated that scour affects OWTs by reducing their natural frequencies. The results also indicate that scour induces OWTs to react differently to EOV. The outcomes of this work provide the basis for real time monitoring of OWTs, thus facilitating a reliable identification of scour.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

With conventional feature extraction methods like damage indices, path-based probability of detection (POD) analysis can be realized. To achieve reliability quantification enough data needs to be available, which is rarely the case. Alternatives like methods for performance assessment on system level are still in development and in a discussion phase. In this contribution, POD results using an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based data analysis are compared with those delivered by conventional data analysis. Using an open-access dataset from Open Guided Wave platform, the possibility of performance assessment for GW-based SHM systems using AI-based data analysis is shown in detail. An artificial neural network (ANN) classifier is trained to detect artificial damage in a stiffened CFRP plate. As input for the ANN, classical damage indicators are used. The ANN is tested to detect damage at another position, whose inspection data were not previously used in training. The findings show very high detection capabilities without sorting any specific path but only having a global view of current damage metrics. The systematic evaluation of the ANN predictions with respect to specific damage sizes allows to compute a probability of correct identification versus flaw dimension, somehow equivalent to and compared with the results achieved through classic path-based POD analysis. Also, sensitive paths are detected by ANN predictions allowing for evaluation of maximal distances between path and damage position. Finally, it is shown that the prediction performance of the ANN can be improved significantly by combining different damage indicators as inputs.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Two interaction networks were developed to identify the trends and patterns in information dissemination via social media. Further, this study focussed on the influence of pandemic situations on the HPB page followers’ interaction through statistical analysis. Derived interaction networks for different languages showed that posts related to pandemic behaviour and COVID-19 symptoms, etc., have low centrality value. Similarly, the interface interaction network revealed that HPB had used a standard method of reporting particular information like situational updates of COVID-19 in terms of interface. Statistical analysis on the number of shares for different interfaces revealed that the posts with text and image have a higher possibility of sharing by a Facebook user. Quantitative analysis shows that users are sensitive to daily COVID-19 positive cases, although the initial interaction for the HPB's page was reduced. Users tend to share the daily COVID-19 report posted by the page whenever a cluster was identified, as it leads to an increment in the rate of reporting infected cases.","['Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Sustainable Development', 'Building Materials', 'Building Construction and Design']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-13013-7_13,en,‘Facing Death Gave Him New Life’: On-Screen Police Gun Violence and Weapon Product Placement,OriginalPaper,"This chapter examines Weapon Product Placement (WPP), the sponsored use of recognisable branded firearms in screen dramas, with a particular focus on depictions of police gun violence in mainstream police television dramas. By exploring the media theory constructs of priming and the copycat effect, we suggest that depictions of police gun violence, which are overwhelmingly positive, contribute to a widespread misunderstanding of policing and the role of violence within policing. We argue that the valorisation of police gun violence on screen is not harmless. It runs counter to well-established and often-codified obligations on police to use minimum levels of force in all circumstances and helps create unrealistic and undesirable public expectations of how police are armed and go about their work and especially of how critical incidents should be resolved. We suggest that WPP should be banned, or at least better regulated, and that classification schemes should be changed to ensure that depictions of policing conform to the doctrine of minimum force. We also suggest that police agencies use their influence over screen producers to ensure that depictions of policing are framed by the minimum force doctrine. (This chapter expands our examination of WPP in ‘“The Devil’s Right Hand”: Policing, Media and Weapons Product Placement’ (Evans and Farmer. Do police need guns?: Policing and firearms: Past, present and future.

Fear dimensions are assumed as reasons for the emergence of panic buying behavior, and include fear of infection, fear of food scarcity, fear of job loss, and fear of crime. This study included an online survey of a convenience sample of 367 reached through electronically administered questionnaire using e-mail and social media platforms. The research hypotheses were tested using multiple linear regression. The results show that the fear of infection, fear of food scarcity, fear of job loss, and fear of crime are predicting higher scores of panic buying behavior. The research findings contribute to existing knowledge on panic buying behavior as the research is uniquely theorizing and testing the mechanisms, by which such psychological dimensions of fear, worked in explaining buyer panic behavior during the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic; where prior research is lacking. Furthermore, this research represents a core point of intersection between two different, yet interdependent disciplines - consumer behavior and psychology. The current research conceptual model uses psychological construct (fear) to explain consumer behavior construct (panic buying). This study provides valuable information and insights on implementing appropriate policies and strategies to mitigate public fear and curb panic buying during pandemic times.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

With increased numbers of vehicles on the roads, the quality of the roads is deteriorating at a faster rate than can be maintained and repaired. This decrease in road health materializes as hazards such as potholes that can cause significant damage to vehicles on the road. Currently, roads’ health is monitored manually and thus done infrequently due to it being both time-consuming and costly for the responsible local transit authorities. Therefore, many road quality issues are repeatedly reported by the people who drive on them before any inspection or repair efforts are undertaken by the transit authorities. This manual process of reporting potholes and other road hazards is an inefficient process requiring filling out forms or making phone calls while remembering the exact location of the pothole or road hazard. This chapter presents Drive Health , an Internet of Things (IoT) system developed to crowdsource the monitoring of the health of roadways by informing transit authorities of pothole locations. Drive Health includes a smart sensor and performs machine learning on accelerometer data to process and analyze the data without using the cloud. If the system determines that the data indicates the existence of a pothole, the location of where the data was collected is recorded and sent to a web server which can then be automatically shared with the transit authorities responsible for that road location.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Business and Management, general']"

Upon regenerative stimuli, satellite cells are activated and undergo myogenic commitment. Myogenic progenitors, which are termed myoblasts Myoblast , undergo rapid proliferation, propagation, and differentiation into myocytes, which then fuse with each other to form new myotubes or to a pre-existing myotube. This process of myogenic differentiation is metabolically demanding and involves cellular remodeling of organelles and cellular architecture. Autophagy Autophagy , a catabolic mechanism involving the sequestration of cellular contents into double membrane autophagosome vesicles, is strongly implicated at various stages during myogenesis Myogenesis ; from the satellite stem cell to the mature muscle tissue. Moreover, aberrant autophagy (both the overstimulation and inhibition of autophagy) in both satellite cells Satellite cell and mature muscle cells can be detrimental for muscle health and physiology.

It is concluded that important aspects of human vulnerability appear largely overlooked in traditional fire safety practices and need to be addressed much more seriously if deaths and injuries are to be significantly reduced. When residential fires exceptionally lead to serious harm, it is often due to certain medical, functional, and/or social vulnerabilities of the victim. Since the same vulnerabilities tend to put residents at risk of many other health and safety hazards as well, the fire safety community should join efforts with health and social resources to develop broader programs for safer housing among vulnerable groups, including fire safety. As part of this, new and innovative fire-related solutions are urgently needed to better compensate for human shortcomings in the event of a fire at home.","['Engineering', 'Fire Science, Hazard Control, Building Safety', 'Psychology, general', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Public Policy', 'Building Construction and Design']"

Concerning human beings, these bioactive components exhibit a wide range of health benefits upon interacting with different physiological systems. Flavonoids, tannins, anthocyanins, carotenoids, betalains, plant sterols, and glucosinolates are few examples of bioactive compounds. They are found primarily in fruits and vegetables. Multiple research studies are being conducted to verify their role in the prevention and possible reversal of cancer and cardiometabolic disorders, such as diabetes, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. Available data and research indicate their role as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant components, facilitating hormonal regulation, immune system modulation, and anticarcinogenic activities. This chapter discusses the impact of bioactive compounds on hormonal regulation in humans. For instance, flavonoids mediate antidiabetic activity by modulating carbohydrate metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Some bioactive compounds have been reported to exhibit neuroprotective effects. Omega-3 fatty acids, phenolics (lignin and tannins), and plant sterol esters can alleviate the risk of cardiovascular disorders and atherosclerosis by reducing inflammation, LDL cholesterol level, and oxidative stress.

The experiments were performed on a 3 mm aluminum plate with a block mass-type damage at three excitation frequencies: the best reconstruction frequency, the sweet spot frequency at which only $$S_0$$ S 0 mode is actuated, and an arbitrarily chosen frequency. Measurements were taken at two temperatures, 25  $$^\circ $$ ∘ C and 50  $$^\circ $$ ∘ C. The percent similarity between the reconstructed and original input signals showed a consistent decrease with the increase in damage height at the best reconstruction frequency. However, at the other excitation frequencies, the change in the similarity with the increase in damage height did not follow a consistent trend, which can lead to erroneous information about damage size. The percent similarity changes significantly with temperature rise at the sweet spot frequency and the arbitrarily chosen frequency. However, it showed minimal change with temperature rise at the best reconstruction frequency for undamaged and damaged states of different severity, making the RTRM suitable for baseline-free damage detection and sizing even under temperature variations.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

However, the high sensitivity of GWs to environmental and operational conditions limits the validity of such references. Notably, variabilities between multiple specimens are often significant from the GWs perspective. These variabilities are particularly important in composites and are due to sensor positioning, sensor coupling and material variability. This communication presents a baseline-free approach using physics-enhanced Machine Learning (ML) for enhanced robustness. To ensure the coverage of these variabilities the approach is validated on multiple Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP) panels. The methodology relies on feature extraction from raw GW signals and training classification algorithms (e.g., kernel machines, neural networks). To make the classifier learn inter-specimen variabilities, an experimental database of 45 impacted composite panels is used. Half of them are used to provide pristine data, and the rest to provide damaged data so that the same sample is either in the training or test set, but never in both. Good classification performance is obtained, demonstrating that the classifier has successfully learnt to recognize defect signatures despite the variability linked to the multiple specimens and instrumentations.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

It plays the role of a scientific platform joining together various disciplines such as chemistry, physics, and material sciences. The development of modern technology is largely dependent on the availability of new types of materials; therefore, the nanostructured approach seems to be one of the key determinants of progress in general. The example of an innovative application for nanoparticles can be the protection of wood and wood-based composites against fire. The demand for these types of raw materials and wood-containing products is constantly growing; however, the directions of their applications may still expand with the use of effective protection measures. The choice of mineral nanomaterials, nano-oxides, nano-metals, or carbon-based nanomaterials for this use seems to be particularly reasonable due to their wide range of favorable features such as good barrier properties, high thermal conductivity, and many others. The already presented research concerns both the addition of the nanomaterials themselves and the implementation of nanomaterials in a combination with other fire retardants. They were found to be effective when incorporated into the wood plastic composites as the additives for polymers, wood-based materials as modifiers for fragmented wood and the adhesives, solid wood, and coating systems. Moreover, the addition of nanomaterials has a positive effect on many other properties of wood and wood products. It is especially important since these properties also determine the suitability in some applications. Taking into account the unique properties of nanomaterials and the constantly growing attention focused on the studies regarding their use in fire protection, this chapter presents the current knowledge on the development of new nanostructured solutions and suspensions for wood products protection against fire with special emphasis on mineral nanomaterials (montmorillonite, sepiolite, and wollastonite), nano-oxides (nano-silica and nano-metal oxides), nano-silver, and carbon-based nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes and graphene platelets).","['Life Sciences', 'Forestry', 'Nanotechnology', 'Plant Sciences', 'Biotechnology', 'Anatomy', 'Genetics and Genomics']"

Methods Using exome sequencing data of 160,615 individuals of the UK Biobank and 18,797 individuals of the Bio Me Biobank, we identified 746 carriers of rare functional HNF1A variants (minor allele frequency ≤1%), of which 507 carry variants in the functional domains. We calculated polygenic risk scores (PRSs) based on genome-wide association study summary statistics for type 2 diabetes, and examined the association of HNF1A variants and PRS with risk of type 2 diabetes and age of diagnosis. We also tested whether the PRS affects the association between HNF1A variants and type 2 diabetes risk by including an interaction term. Results Rare HNF1A variants that are predicted to impair protein function are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes in individuals of European ancestry (OR 1.46, p =0.049), particularly when the variants are located in the functional domains (OR 1.89, p =0.002). No association was observed for individuals of African ancestry (OR 1.10, p =0.60) or Hispanic-Latino ancestry (OR 1.00, p =1.00). Rare functional HNF1A variants were associated with an earlier age at diagnosis in the Hispanic-Latino population (β=−5.0 years, p =0.03), and this association was marginally more pronounced for variants in the functional domains (β=−5.59 years, p =0.03). No associations were observed for other ancestries (African ancestry β=−2.7 years, p =0.13; European ancestry β=−3.5 years, p =0.20). A higher PRS was associated with increased odds of type 2 diabetes in all ancestries (OR 1.61–2.11, p <10 −5 ) and an earlier age at diagnosis in individuals of African ancestry (β=−1.4 years, p =3.7 × 10 −6 ) and Hispanic-Latino ancestry (β=−2.4 years, p <2 × 10 −16 ). Furthermore, a higher PRS exacerbated the effect of the functional HNF1A variants on type 2 diabetes in the European ancestry population ( p interaction =0.037). Conclusions/interpretation We show that rare functional HNF1A variants, in particular those located in the functional domains, increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, at least among individuals of European ancestry. Their effect is even more pronounced in individuals with a high polygenic susceptibility. Our analyses highlight the importance of the location of functional variants within a gene and an individual’s overall polygenic susceptibility, and emphasise the need for more genetic data in non-European populations.

One technology holds promise to facilitate lifelong learning via a unique quasi-synchronous communicative mode: mobile instant messaging (MIM). In this study, we operationalized lifelong learning in the context of professional adult education as learning that goes beyond instruction-driven pedagogy in formal learning contexts. Inspired by the theory of heutagogy, we conducted an extensive review of the research and reported on the contexts, approaches, benefits, and challenges of using MIM in professional learning. The results show that related studies had just started to emerge in recent years (since 2017) and focused mainly on two MIM services – WeChat and WhatsApp. MIM were mainly used by professionals such as teachers and doctors, as well as people in need of professional help. People used MIM tools to establish online communities of practices, disseminate knowledge, and seek for help. We identified an array of beneficial features of MIM to support lifelong learning, including ease of use, multimodality, immediacy, continuance, flexibility, and comfort. The challenges of using MIM to support lifelong learning include the size limit of WhatsApp groups, the chronological features, the intrusiveness of irrelevant messages, and the concerns over user privacy.

As a consequence, the current structural condition as well as relevant historical data have to be taken into account to have an up-to-date representation of the actual physical system in operation. Digital twins can play a primary role in the evaluation of the current condition of the structure and in anomaly detection to support structural maintenance. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is currently showing a potential in this perspective thanks to the possibility of collecting miscellaneous data and information in a unified platform; however, its extension to facility management is an open issue, in particular when the digital models have to be complemented with data coming from SHM systems. So, an effective integration between the two is highly desirable. The present paper aims at demonstrating how relevant information coming from SHM systems can be integrated into a BIM model of a structure to make them available for interrogation and further analyses. The development of a digital twin of a historical structure combining SHM data, BIM, and finite element model updating is illustrated pointing out its promising applicative perspectives for structural maintenance.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Underdeveloped conceptual theories that fail to expose a measurement mechanism are one reason for the incommensurable measurements. Without such a mechanism measurements cannot be linked to a fundamental reference as required by metrological traceability. However, traditional metrological concepts can be extended by allowing for direct links between different instruments, so-called crosswalks. In this regard, Rasch Measurement Theory proves particularly useful as it facilitates a co-calibration of different instruments onto a common metric. The example of the measurement of nicotine dependence through self-report instruments serves as a showcase of the problems in social measurement and how they can be overcome contributing to metrological traceability in the social sciences.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Health Informatics', 'Psychometrics', 'Health Administration']"

Its acronym in Spanish) is a public healthcare institution that provides medical attention, teaching and scientific research centered on diseases of the respiratory system. In 2019, the hospital held 228 beds and over six thousand medical devices for diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of patients. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic pushed the Hospital to convert 215 conventional care beds to intensive care beds, assigned exclusively to critical COVID-19 patients. This resulted in a higher demand of Health Technology Management (HTM) resources which were reflected by a 60% increase in the Hospital’s medical devices. Therefore, the technical staff of the Department of Biomedical Engineering grew by 300%. Thus, the objective of this work was to innovate HTM procedures through the application of Six Sigma Methodology and two Lean tools: 5S and Kanban, to control the activities carried out at the Hospital. Procedures for dealing with work orders and inventory control of supplies (accessories, consumables, and spare parts) that medical equipment require for its operation were analyzed. Additionally, three activities related to HTM were analyzed: tool control, work area control and information flow among all 5 personnel work shifts. In total, seven innovation strategies were proposed and implemented in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the INER.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering', 'Bioinformatics']"

The main argument, to be developed in Chap. 9 the final chapter, is based on three assertions defended here. First, there is a distinction between, what is called, explanatory and purpose-based approaches to understanding well-being and its promotion in social policy and welfare practice. These approaches reflect two very different accounts of ontology, epistemology, and normativity, which have been uncovered and explored. Second, without siding with one over the other, a pluralist response is recommended, arguing that both the explanatory and purpose based approaches should be promoted simultaneously. The main claim is that this pluralist response underpins a fully articulated understanding of TOWT, helping to make better sense of debates in social policy and welfare practice which intend to enhance well-being for populations. Third, a pluralist response also claims that the dichotomy between ‘subjective’ and ‘objective’ categories of well-being, while can be important to maintain politically, at least in certain circumstances, is a distinction that can break down, or become very blurred, philosophically speaking. As argued here and throughout the book, philosophically a false dichotomy between these categories of well-being is revealed when examining complex and conflicting human experiences, and particularly if the six ontological features of the human condition identified in TOWT and in Chap. 2 , are fully recognised and accommodated.","['Philosophy', 'Political Philosophy', 'Employee Health and Wellbeing', 'Social Policy', 'Politics of the Welfare State', 'Social Work and Community Development', 'Comparative Social Policy']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-07322-9_18,en,Development of GUI Based Tool for the Visualization of the FBG Spectrum Subjected to Guided Waves,OriginalPaper,"Fiber optical grating (FBG) sensors offer several advantages such as small size, ability to be embedded, and insensitivity to magnetic and electric fields, and hence are widely used for monitoring in several sectors. FBG sensors are most commonly used for strain-based structural health monitoring (SHM), but recent developments are also focused on using them for guided waves (GW) based SHM. The coupling of the GW to the fiber is a very complex phenomenon and needs to be studied in detail. The numerical studies with optical fibers are computationally expensive due to the small mesh size needed for capturing the wave propagation. Also, the conversion of the strain profile from the numerical model to the spectral response of the FBG sensor is a non-trivial process needing complex matrix manipulations. Thus, in this paper, a tool for the visualization of the FBG spectrum change subjected to GW is developed. A GUI based tool is developed and validated with experiments to allow easy visualization of the FBG response by the engineers. Through the use of the tool, the fiber need not be modeled thus making the numerical analysis less demanding.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Then, the three major competing explanations for the high levels of police killings in the country are examined: (i) the endorsement of authoritarian practices; (ii) the legacy of slavery; and (iii) the war on crime. To test the validity of these hypotheses, the administrative records systematized by the Brazilian Forum of Public Safety (FBSP, acronym in Portuguese) and the Mortality Information System (SIM, acronym in Portuguese) were organized in a panel dataset, which was used to estimate Poisson regression models. None of the hypotheses were fully confirmed by the statistical analyses, suggesting that police killings in Brazil are strongly correlated with multiple social and political factors.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Crime and Society', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Public Health']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-07322-9_47,en,Bayesian Changepoint Modelling for Reference-Free Damage Detection with Acoustic Emission Data,OriginalPaper,"Acoustic emission testing remains a popular technique in the SHM community due to its effectiveness in detecting and localising small occurrences of damage in a structure. One of the characteristics of acoustic emissions is that all structures will produce some level of emission even if only benign flaws are present. As such, it is often necessary to collect a baseline reference set of data against which newly collected measurements can be compared to establish the state of the structure. In this work, a methodology is proposed which eliminates the need for this “training phase” through use of a statistical model which learns and adapts online. The chosen technique is a Bayesian online changepoint detection method where bursts of acoustic emission are modelled as a Poisson point process. In this way the inherent stochasticity in the number of “hits” emitted in a given window is learnt and modelled online, then significant changes in the properties of the generating stochastic model are used to provide sensitivity to damage. This approach has a number of benefits which are demonstrated on an experimental dataset from a bearing test rig. The main benefit is removing the need to collect extensive data before the SHM system can become operational. The proposed solution also allows prior engineering knowledge to be exploited, for instance by specifying priors related to the expected number of hits in a given window, or through use of a Hazard Function which encodes prior belief about the expected time before damage will occur. Finally, the method is shown to characterise the full probability distribution over possible run lengths. This information provides not only an indication of if a significant change in the behaviour of the system has occurred, but also automatically quantifies a degree of confidence in that change.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Fatalities, i.e., on roads, railways, and bridges, originate from either accidents or suicides, natural death excluded. Knowing the correct manner of death is needed to work with optimal prevention strategies. The aims are to separate fatalities due to suicides, follow the development, and implement measures for suicide prevention. Methods are developed for suicide classification and criteria for the selection in which suicides were suspected. Fatalities in level one and two of five were classified as suicides. Data from the STA’s databases are used and so are data from the psychosocial investigations done by a trained investigator in the topic and with clinical experience from counselling at hospitals. 2129 persons died on the roads in Sweden, 10% (206 persons) were classified as suicides. 336 persons died after being hit by trains, 85% (284 persons) were suicides. 130 persons died by jumping from bridges. The number of suicides increases with population density. Suicide in the transport system is a major problem; firstly personal tragedies, it is also a work environment problem for truck and train drivers and for the emergency staff. It generates delays and costs for passenger and cargo transport. By analyzing the results of countermeasures in the form of obstructive barriers, the physical environment can be improved and high-risk areas can be accentuated. Restricting access to the means of suicide is important in suicide prevention. Strategies for the STA include suicide prevention in the design of new roads, railways, and bridges, as well as by identifying and reducing existing high-risk locations. Sharing the results with other authorities and organizations and cooperation within suicide prevention missions are vital for the enhancement of the overall suicide prevention work in society.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

An experimentalist approach had been applied to cope with a situation of high uncertainty, according to which public authorities have been able to learn and readapt their strategy along the way. However, in other instances, when the crisis seemed to wane or at least reduced its intensity, policy decisions were made following a more conventional pattern of polarized consociationalism, whereby different types of political actors—especially political parties and business representatives—were able to reshape and partially co-determine the policy outputs, against the background a policy process that is characteristically open to societal inputs. The second and the fourth stage of the pandemic, corresponding to summer to early winter 2020 and, respectively, late spring to autumn 2021, displayed indeed more politicization, resulting in a reactive rather than anticipatory attitude of policymakers.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Comparative Politics']"

Despite the dramatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, there is a rising trend of people refusing to be vaccinated. As a result, governments and health experts must gather and understand public ideas and perceptions about vaccines to design engagement and education efforts about vaccine advantages. Sentiment analysis is a common method for acquiring a broad picture of public opinion, that enables the classification of people as those who are in favor or against vaccination, as well as the determination of the factors that influence their attitudes and beliefs. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the general approach to sentiment analysis in the context of vaccinations and review its different use cases. The chapter’s experimental component integrates the utilization of a dataset retrieved from Kaggle, which contains COVID-19 vaccine-related Twitter data. When attempting to perform sentiment analysis, certain methodological steps need to be considered after data collection, including data pre-processing, technique selection and model construction, as well as model evaluation and results interpretation. Both supervised and unsupervised sentiment analysis methods are investigated in the model construction step, with the former involving the implementation of Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression algorithms, and the latter involving the use of TextBlob and Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) sentiment analysis tools. The performance of each algorithm and tool is evaluated, as is the performance of each sentiment detection approach in order to select the best performing one. Social media platforms have become a common source of information and misinformation regarding vaccines. Our effort aims to emphasize the importance of mining such readily available public attitudes, as well as forecast opinions and reactions related to vaccine uptake in near real-time.

Traditionally, the professional structure of higher education has provided restricted employment, career, and leadership opportunities for women, which is exacerbated where there is an intersection with race, culture, religion, or age. Women continue to be underrepresented in academia across various disciplines and this lack of representation in senior positions within the professional structure of higher education itself acts as a barrier to more women reaching senior levels within institutions. More women are needed in higher positions to increase representation and visibility, to be truly inclusive of all, and to encourage and mentor others to then aspire to follow a similar path. This critical review examines gender equity across the major career benchmarks of the academy in light of the impact of the personal contexts of women, systemic processes that hinder career progression, inclusion and cultural barriers that impede promotion and career progression. Research-based systemic, inclusive solutions are discussed that work towards improved gender equity for all women. The findings from this critical review highlight the need for systemic change globally in higher education to create equities that are inclusionary in the employment, career, and leadership opportunities for women.","['Education', 'Education, general', 'Pedagogic Psychology', 'International and Comparative Education']"

In order to ensure the safe production of cranes, nondestructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM) of boom become more and more urgent and important. In this paper, the intelligent defect location algorithm based on helical guided waves is applied to the weld defect detection of U-shaped boom. Intelligent defect location algorithm is an imaging algorithm that combines ellipse imaging principle, evolutionary algorithm and K-means clustering algorithm. This paper verifies the effectiveness of this algorithm for weld defect location of U-shaped boom through experimental research. Firstly, the propagation regularity of helical guided waves in the U-shaped boom structure is studied. In addition, the elliptical imaging algorithm is used to image and analyze the weld defects in the U-shaped boom, and the location of the defects is preliminarily determined. The defect location analysis of weld defects is carried out by using the intelligent defect location algorithm. By comparing the imaging results of the two methods, it is found that the intelligent defect location algorithm has higher resolution and can effectively improve the defect location accuracy.

Heritability – It is the proportion of the phenotypic variance that is attributable to genetic variation; the narrow sense heritability is commonly used in animal breeding where the numerator in the statistic is the additive genetic variance (as opposed to the total genetic variance which is used in the definition of the broad sense heritability). Heterosis – It stems from the Greek words “ heteros ” meaning different and “ osis ” meaning condition and is a phenomenon where the performance of progeny from genetically different parents is superior to the mean of both parents. Decision support tool – It is a means to support faster and more informed decision making.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Veterinary Medicine/Veterinary Science', 'Biotechnology', 'Agriculture', 'Genetics and Genomics']"

Entomophagy is one such option, which already has a long history and is currently being eaten by approximately 2 billion people in 113 countries. Insects are a rich source of macro- and micro-nutrients, which are equivalent or sometimes even exceed the amounts present in usual animal food commonly being consumed by humans. Consumption of insects as food is not going to be beneficial just for humans but has environmental and socio-economic benefits as well. The consumption of insects can be increased by addressing the problem of insects being considered as nasty and disgusting by disseminating knowledge regarding its benefits. With increasing development of the insect food industry, there is a need for the development and implementation of insect legislation regulations in the world. Further research is needed to increase insect production and commercialization. The chapter focuses on the history of entomophagy, the main orders of insects being consumed, its benefits as food and also risks associated with insect consumption.","['Life Sciences', 'Zoology']"

Their decomposition usually relies upon handcrafted designed kernels, such as the complex steerable kernels, which typically may not be optimally designed for the extraction of subtle motions specially in higher frequency domains. In this paper, optimal decomposition kernel is learned and designed directly from baseline dataset images using deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Each subpixel of an image obtained from a digital camera is included when computing the spatiotemporal information, which serves similar to an individual motion sensor to acquire the modal frequencies of a vibrating structure. A hybrid-attention-LSTM-based deep convolutional neural network architecture is developed to take advantage of attention and LSTM blocks to discover subtle motions from a specific source to visualize high resolution of dynamic properties of the structures in the existence of high amounts of noise. The idea of transfer learning is utilized to transfer the knowledge previously learned to new limited dataset. Transfer learning is used to take advantage of limited existing dataset to avoid underfitting in the training of the network, considering the current publicly available modal frequency datasets are insufficient to train a generalized network. The proposed deep learning architecture is designed in such a way that has capability of transferring the trained model from baseline dataset on a simple structure to a complicated structure using transfer learning perspective. After training, the model takes the video of a vibrating structure as input and outputs the fundamental modal frequencies. By showing reliable empirical results, the proposed model is autonomous, efficient, and accurate.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

There were other preservation methods available: salting, pickling, drying, spicing, and smoking. However, most of the fresh foods and other temperature-sensitive goods were available only in the local market due to their short shelf life and perishability. With the advancement of cooling technology, temperature-controlled supply chain or cold chain is developed; therefore, the fresh food today can be stored longer and transported to different markets across the borders of the countries. Refrigeration technologies play vital role to preserve and transport perishable food from the point of production to the point of consumption. In the past, a cold chain simply denoted single temperature warehouses and refrigerated vehicles. There was no awareness of integrating the supply chain links and, as a result, billions of dollars’ worth of losses occurred every year. To achieve basic understanding on the cold chain, food and vaccines cold chains are explained and socioeconomic and environmental impacts, and the research trends of cold chain are presented.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Operations Management', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes']"

There is little theoretical or empirical evidence that explains how caffeine consumption may influence aggressive behavior. We review research investigating the relationship between caffeine and aggression in both human and non-human animals across the lifespan. Based on this review, there is no clear consensus. The strongest evidence comes from studies investigating the co-consumption of caffeine and alcohol in adolescents and adults. Those who co-ingest caffeine and alcohol are more likely to be perpetrators or victims of aggression. Among adolescents, findings appear to converge that caffeine intake via energy drinks is related to increased aggression, including both perpetration and victimization. Theoretical advances and stronger experimental evidence are required to clarify the role of caffeine in aggression.

The PUFA content of the cell membrane is mostly determined by dietary intake. They are a component of the cellular membrane, improving its fluidity and PUFAs must be released from the membrane by phospholipases in order for signal transmission to occur. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids exert their anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting lipogenesis and increasing the production of resolvins and protectins. n-3 PUFAs mediate some of these effects by antagonizing n-6 PUFA-induced proinflammatory prostaglandin E formation. Today’s industrialized societies with Westernized diet styles have higher overall energy intake, and n-6 PUFAs, but lower energy expenditure. Omega-3 PUFA attenuates ER stress and increases mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation and mitochondrial uncoupling. There is competition between omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 for desaturation enzymes. The unbalanced omega 6/omega 3 ratio in favor of omega 6 PUFAs contributes to the prevalence of atherosclerosis, obesity, and diabetes. n-3 PUFAs are considered to be more protective against inflammation compared with omega 6 PUFA, suggesting the importance of maintaining an ideal balance.","['Biomedicine', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Pharmacology/Toxicology']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-18142-9_2,en,Well-Being and the Human Condition,OriginalPaper,"Following the political and philosophical debates explored in Chap. 1 , six ontological features of the human condition are identified, described and explored in this chapter, and which are central to The Ontology of Well-Being Thesis (TOWT) defended here and throughout the book. The features are, in no prioritised order, human embodiment , finiteness , sociability , cognition , evaluation , and agency . The main argument is that these features need articulating in any plausible epistemological account of well-being, concerning what we know about this phenomenon, focussing on how we establish what, in and of itself, helps a life go better. And concerning how well-being is understood normatively, and so is promoted as a social value, notably in social policy and welfare practice. The principal assumption is therefore existentialist in character – that is, well-being, while is promotable as a substantive social ideal to be enhanced for future populations, must first reflect the existential and ontological features of what and who human beings are presently, with these features reflected across a gamut of human experiences. A further claim of TOWT is that these ontological features interrelate in complex ways, producing various conflicts in the epistemology and normativity of human well-being, and how it is understood and practically applied. Significantly, conflicting experiences of time, emotion, and self-consciousness are revealed, which, it is argued, must be accommodated for in any comprehensive epistemological and normative account of human well-being, which then can be usefully applied to a range of social policies and welfare practices.","['Philosophy', 'Political Philosophy', 'Employee Health and Wellbeing', 'Social Policy', 'Politics of the Welfare State', 'Social Work and Community Development', 'Comparative Social Policy']"

We start from the basic idea that accident is the interaction between a dangerous device and the worker, that can be directly linked to the generalized energy in a defined space. Each energy is characterized by parameters related to hazards for which the severity is defined by the standards and regulations. The methodology proposed combines a generic design approach based on a systems engineering approach to identify the uses that operators will make to ensure production requirements, and an energy approach for identifying potential hazards.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Computer-Aided Engineering (CAD, CAE) and Design']"

It is slated that the world has to battle with it and to follow SOP’s until and unless an effective vaccine will be developed. On the technological side, IoT is a new and promising area to combat with the COVID-19 Pandemic. Nowadays, smartphones and wearables have various onboard sensors like temperature sensor, proximity sensor, an audio sensor, camera, inertial sensor, color sensor, etc. that can be used in getting the data of a person. The temperature sensor reading can tell us the temperature of a person. Based on that reading, a person can be sent for further clinical tests at an initial level.

The Framework consists of three layers: Sensing Layer or Data Collection Layer, Data Analytics Layer, and Prediction Layer. In Sensing Layer, different sensors are used to collect the data and send it for analysis. In Analysis Layer, the level of symptoms is calculated from the data received from the Sensing Layer. The third layer is the Prediction Layer, in which prediction is made from the computed values in Analysis Layer, whether the suspected may be COVID-19 positive or negative. The last layer is the cloud layer used for storage services and data used for further analysis. The proposed IoTFEC framework aims to detect the COVID-19 suspected early, provide early treatment, and stop further spreading.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']"

We propose our Early Mental Health Uncovering (EMU) framework that conducts rapid mental illness screening with active and passive modalities. We designed, deployed, and evaluated the EMU app to passively collect retrospective digital phenotype data and actively collect short voice recordings. The EMU app also administered a depression screening survey to label the data. We collected data from crowdsourced and student populations, both of whom shared sufficient voice recordings for modeling. We thus assess the classification ability of machine learning and deep learning models trained with scripted and unscripted voice recordings. For the crowdsourced participants, machine learning models screened for depression with an AUC of 0.78 and suicidal ideation with an AUC of 0.73. For the student participants, deep learning models screened for depression with an AUC of 0.70 and suicidal ideation with an AUC of 0.72. Combining datasets did not improve screening capabilities, though the best performing models on the combined dataset notably required voice transcripts.

In the past, damage identification was performed through periodical inspection, non-destructive testing/non-destructive evaluation, or visual observation. Structural health monitoring (SHM) has emerged to transition from offline damage identification to near real-time and online damage assessment. Hence, SHM is a damage detection strategy to monitor a structure for a period using a series of continuous measurement devices, which then collect the system’s characteristics and subsequently perform statistical analysis to assess the current circumstances and health of the structure. One of the first steps for the study of SHM is damage detection followed by monitoring. Machine Learning (ML) techniques can be used to develop viable algorithms to make potential predictions. ML algorithms are therefore providing the tools needed to enhance the capabilities of SHM systems and provide intelligent solutions to past challenges. Preliminary studies have reviewed that the extension of ML into SHM has dramatically increased the system’s capabilities, providing innovative solutions to different research challenges. This work conducts a study of the use of ML to identify damage in a beam and discuss the challenge of usage, performance and implementation of each technique.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis']"

Plastic products release different types of additive materials in environment during decomposition process. Recent studies show that leaching of additives from plastic products is great matter of concern as they are persistent, bioaccumulative in nature, and highly toxic to biota. Among these added materials, flame retardants (FRs) possess critical virulent effects on aquatic life and human beings. FRs are synthetic chemicals widely used in consumer products to increase their ignition resistance property. Different types of FRs are utilized in plastic industry such as organohalogen, organophosphate, metal (aluminum)-, and nitrogen-containing FRs. The organohalogen FRs now a days are the most preferably used FRs because of low coast, competence, and good performance. Among organohalogen, brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are widely used in consumer products. Several traditional BFRs (e.g., polybrominated diphenyl ether [PBDE]) have been included in the list of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and their utilization is restricted due to their known toxicity and persistence nature. Over the past few years, these compounds have been replaced with “new” BFRs (NBFRs). In spite of the fact that chemical structure of NBFRs and traditional BFRs are different but they share most of the physical-chemical properties (substitution of halogen atom and solubility in fat) which are similar to both groups; therefore, their outcome in environment is possibly similar to the restricted BFRs. Due to their potential toxicity to humans and organisms, as well as persistent and bioaccumulative nature, their complete removal (including real-time analysis, rules, and regulations) or transformation into another useful product is highly crucial. In this way, traditional techniques such as photocatalysis, thermal degradation, adsorption, and anaerobic degradation were employed. Recently, nanomaterials (including metal, metal oxide, and nanocomposites) with small size and high surface area emerge as the most economic, rapid, and effective photocatalysts under artificial and sunlight irradiation, also used for debromination of BFRs by using different mechanisms. The current chapter brings out readers with broad information on problem related with traditional BFRs and NBFRs (classification, consumption, environmental concentration, and need for different degradation techniques) and their removal using nanoparticles (NPs) through adsorption, photocatalysis, reductive, and oxidative debromination. Furthermore, significance of green synthesized NPs in the degradation of BFRs has future scope.","['Materials Science', 'Nanotechnology', 'Sustainable Development']"

Initially, the state governments competed against each other over the “right” way to handle the situation. The different strategies adopted by the states informed the federal government’s policy decisions, which resulted in the first nationwide lockdown. Subsequently, the state governments began to compete against one another again and challenged the federal government over the most appropriate policy approaches after the lockdown period. The political constellation resulted in a system in which the federal government and the state governments agreed to coordinate policymaking. In substantive terms, the policy response initially focussed on containment, economic and employment policies but then shifted towards health policy, with vaccination and testing at its centre.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Comparative Politics']"

Over the course of the pandemic, a debate has emerged about the appropriate democratic and technopolitical response when governments use disease surveillance technologies to tackle the spread of COVID-19, pointing out the dichotomy between state-Leviathan cybercontrol and civil liberties. The COVID-19 pandemic has inevitably raised the need to resiliently and technopolitically respond to democratic threats that hyperconnected and highly virialised societies produce. In order to shed light on this debate, amidst this volume on “democratic deepening”, this chapter introduces the new term “postpandemic technopolitical democracy” as a way to figure out emerging forms and scales for developing democracy and citizen participation in hyperconnected and highly virialised postpandemic societies. Insofar as the digital layer cannot be detached from the current democratic challenges of the twenty-first century including neoliberalism, scales, civic engagement, and action research-driven co-production methodologies; this chapter suggests a democratic toolbox encompassing four intertwined factors including (i) the context characterised by the algorithmic nations, (ii) challenges stemming from data sovereignty, (iii) mobilisation seen from the digital rights perspective, and (iv) grassroots innovation embodied through data cooperatives. This chapter elucidates that in the absence of coordinated and interdependent strategies to claim digital rights and data sovereignty by algorithmic nations, on the one hand, big tech data-opolies and, on the other hand, the GDPR led by the European Commission might bound (negatively) and expand (positively) respectively, algorithmic nations’ capacity to mitigate the negative side effects of the algorithmic disruption in Western democracies.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Public Policy']"

For the latter group the evidence is of human rights abuses and a failure to deliver socially just outcomes, particularly for people in immigration detention. Social workers engage with diverse communities including those who have been formally approved as refugees, or lived in detention, and who may continue to live on temporary protection visas. This presents tensions between meeting the aims of the ethical codes of practice and the reality facing their clients of having limited access to resources and social justice. It presents the lived experience of two prominent refugees who have written about their experiences of unsuccessful claims for protection in Australia.

We investigated whether smoking and snus use increase the risk of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and elucidated potential interaction with HLA high-risk genotypes. Methods Analyses were based on Swedish case–control data (collected 2010–2019) with incident cases of LADA ( n =593) and type 2 diabetes ( n =2038), and 3036 controls, and Norwegian prospective data (collected 1984–2019) with incident cases of LADA ( n =245) and type 2 diabetes ( n =3726) during 1,696,503 person-years of follow-up. Pooled RRs with 95% CIs were estimated for smoking, and ORs for snus use (case–control data only). The interaction was assessed by attributable proportion (AP) due to interaction. A two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) study on smoking and LADA/type 2 diabetes was conducted based on summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. Results Smoking (RR pooled 1.30 [95% CI 1.06, 1.59] for current vs never) and snus use (OR 1.97 [95% CI 1.20, 3.24] for ≥15 box-years vs never use) were associated with an increased risk of LADA. Corresponding estimates for type 2 diabetes were 1.38 (95% CI 1.28, 1.49) and 1.92 (95% CI 1.27, 2.90), respectively. There was interaction between smoking and HLA high-risk genotypes (AP 0.27 [95% CI 0.01, 0.53]) in relation to LADA. The positive association between smoking and LADA/type 2 diabetes was confirmed by the MR study. Conclusions/interpretation Our findings suggest that tobacco use increases the risk of LADA and that smoking acts synergistically with genetic susceptibility in the promotion of LADA.

As the pandemic continued to claim lives, an ample amount of unchecked information was circulating online about the disease, this resulted in citizens facing a wave of fake news not only in Jordan but across the world. This has led governments and health institutions to echo their concerns about the serious threat fake news can cause to citizens’ lives. This research study uses a quantitative content analysis to report on the sources and types of fake news spread in Jordan between the period of April 2020 until April 2021 using a data collected by a Jordanian fact checking news website named AKEED. This study is of a vital importance given the scale of concerns resonated by the World Health Organization about facing tsunami of misinformation termed as infodemic. This also comes in a time that is described as “post truth” era. This study concludes that both infodemic and post truth eras hold true in the case of fake news disseminated in Jordan. The study also found that many of these stories are originated from inside of Jordan and that social media networks were the dominant place for these false stories to spread and reach to audiences. The study reveled that fake news stories related to health were the highest number of stories spread in Jordan with the period of this study. Also, the highest percentage of fake news were classified as inaccurate stories with a percentage of 48.40% followed by an intentionally fabricated stories with a percentage of 24.52%.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Sustainable Development']"

Decision-making was centered around the Prime Minister’s Office and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, and horizontal coordination created challenges. The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare was highly visible throughout the crisis, but occasionally the views of the health authorities and the government differed. After an initial seemingly passive phase, the government in mid-March 2020 declared a state of emergency and imposed strict anti-pandemic measures. The first wave of the pandemic was characterized by a sense of national urgency both in terms of policies and public opinion. Subsequently the government shifted to a decentralized, hybrid strategy under normal legislation, with targeted regional solutions favoured more instead of nation-wide measures. This produced occasional tensions between subnational authorities and the national executive while the confusing terminology of the authorities contributed to the increasing criticism of the government. However, overall, there was very little contestation of the adopted measures.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Comparative Politics']"

Given a specific SHM approach, the sensor topology, the feature selection, and the employed detector are the main elements that control the detection performance. This work provides an exploratory analysis of the statistical response patterns that govern a structure subjected to variable loads and methodically arrives at an optimal sensor topology, that maximizes the detection performance. For demonstration purposes, a thin square plate subjected to probabilistically described loads is considered. The damage of interest corresponds to a uniform thickness loss, the detection of which is evaluated at different damage levels (from 1% to a 90% unrealistic upper bound). The damage is to be identified indirectly, through strain sensing. The problem is numerically approached (Finite Elements and Monte Carlo Simulations).

In addition to posing a threat to human health, human waste contains high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus, which can wreak ecological harm when improperly discharged. However, nitrogen and phosphorus are also key ingredients for fertilizers used in agricultural food production. This case study follows the development of ElectroSan, a pre-revenue process engineering spinoff that focuses on novel processes for converting urine into valuable products. The two primary technologies ElectroSan uses to extract nitrogen from urine are ion exchange and electrochemical stripping. The efficacy of these technologies (primarily ion exchange) was investigated through field trials enabled by a partnership with Sanergy in Nairobi, Kenya. Through experimentation and market analyses, Dowex Mac 3 was identified as the most suitable resin for nitrogen recovery. Additionally, this process could produce ammonium sulfate fertilizer at a lower cost to competing products and also had the advantages of providing a steady, local supply of fertilizer that could be applied by fertigation. This approach thus avoided local ecosystem damage from improper disposal, created local economic opportunities, and partially closed the nutrient cycle locally. Life cycle and techno-economic assessments (in the context of San Francisco, CA) found that the sulfuric acid used for regeneration of the resin represented 70% of greenhouse gas emissions and energy input (embedded energy from the manufacturing process). Providing insights into the importance of partnerships, being adaptive with assumptions, and the realities of conducting fieldwork, the ElectroSan research project continues to explore the valorization of urine and has expanded to new contexts, including other parts of Kenya (with Sanivation) and Dakar, Senegal (with Delvic Sanitation Initiatives).","['Environment', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Development Economics', 'Development and Sustainability', 'Engineering Design', 'Social/Human Development Studies']"

While states retain their predominance in diplomacy, the assumed interdependence of the world, its globalization, the emergence of new non-governmental actors, and the growing complexity of modern issues require a new approach. Perhaps the main challenge of contemporary diplomacy is to find a right balance between old, traditional elements, and new, modern ones. Few international relations studies have ever highlighted the importance of network diplomacy. Yet the digitalization of the world and its transformation into a giant network, where communication is instantaneous and fast, leads us to ask new questions about global governance. There is a need to rethink the world in terms of networks, a more adapted way to seek better global solutions, and a more comprehensive, efficient decision-making process at the governmental level. This chapter analyses the main developments towards network diplomacy and the role it plays in broadening the scope of solutions to global challenges in a globalized era. It is based on history, on definitions, and on the work and opinions given by pioneer researchers on network diplomacy, who share their analysis of the theoretical implications of this new phenomenon.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Diplomacy', 'International Relations', 'International Organization']"

The focus of this work is on minimizing their weakening effect. For this purpose, a suitable criterion is developed and different sensors in terms of position, geometry and material properties are applied.

Currently, damage assessment is performed mainly by visual inspection and often impossible for structural members that are inaccessible, such as deep foundations or interior members hidden by cladding. This research explores the possibility of using embedded ultrasonic transducers to monitor reinforced concrete members for damage progression under reverse-cyclic loading. The proposed approach uses a combination of passive and active ultrasonic stress wave monitoring approaches. The former, commonly referred to as acoustic emission monitoring, captures the energy released from active fracture sources. The latter is based on traditional and coda ultrasonic stress wave monitoring, which can take advantage of the highly sensitive diffuse portion of recorded waveforms to capture minute changes in a material. In this paper we introduce select results from a full-scale column-footing subassembly that was tested in the laboratory using a reverse-cyclic lateral loading protocol representative of a subduction zone earthquake with varying axial loading. A combination of surface-mounted and embedded transducers was employed to monitor the specimen throughout the loading process. The findings demonstrate the complementary information that may be gained from the proposed combined monitoring approach to characterize damage progression in reinforced concrete members.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

When processing citrus fruit, large amounts of waste are produced. Citrus fruit waste products contain high value-added compounds (polyphenolic compounds, carotenoids, and essential oils), support health positively, and can be used in different industries. Many studies have shown that polyphenolic compounds, carotenoids, and essential oils have beneficial effects on health. Polyphenolic compounds have remarkable potential as valuable raw materials in the production of functional food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Citrus peels and seeds have high commercial value as raw materials for essential oils. In this chapter, citrus oil and its by-products are discussed. It is inevitable to search for alternative oil sources with industrial importance, especially their functional and nutritional quality. Phytochemicals such as carotenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, and terpenes have many beneficial effects on essential oils obtained from the peels, seeds, and leaves of citrus fruits, which are considered waste.

These devices are expected to have high sensitivity, portability and selectivity. Off lately, an extensive focus on designing biosensors with an imperative technique has been accomplished to ensemble the materials, equipment and methodologies to improve their performance. Basically, biosensor is an analytical sensor which has a biological moiety, like enzymes, antibodies, live cells, etc., as an electron transfer mediator to detect analytes via a suitable detection mechanism including electro-catalytic activity. These sensors tend to produce electrical current signals whose intensity is dependent on the concentration of the selective analyte. Since, 1999, when IUPAC designated biosensor as a sovereign tool for selective qualitative and quantitative analyte detection, several chemically modified biosensors have been reported. However, most of these are bulk electrodes that are laboratory-based, use large sample volumes, lack POC approach and therefore cannot be employed for real time field sensing. To overcome this, significant research has been carried out to miniaturize and integrate microfluidic concept with these devices. The advent of microfluidics not only makes these biosensors suitable for real-time practical application but also makes them cost-effective, portable and more sensitive. During the last few years, several research groups globally have successfully developed miniaturized/microfluidic biosensor-integrated electrochemical platforms for health care applications. The present chapter briefly describes the fabrication, characterization, materials used and types of these biosensor devices and summarizes some of the recent advance applications in health management.

The necessity of a monitoring system usually results from one of two reasons: Either the calculated bearing capacity can be verified, but there is damage (e.g. cracks) that endangers the bearing capacity, or the structure has shown normal behavior since construction but cannot be verified by calculation. As a result of the significantly lower hazard potential of the waterway infrastructure compared to dams, automatic measuring systems are usually not installed but individually conceived if necessary. In order to optimize this process, a modular system is being developed. The paper focuses on the requirements and characteristics of massive hydraulic structures with regard to the monitoring system. These are in particular the large dimensions and individuality of the structures, the comparatively small deformations without significant vibration behavior, the long measurement periods, as well as the rough environmental conditions (humidity, temperature variations, direct solar radiation etc.). As an example, the long-term behavior of the measurements of a monitoring system in a lock is analyzed and a test rig is conceived for the investigation of the suitability and long-term stability of different inclinometer.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

However, all HUMS application based on fiber optics can be enabled thanks to the proposed Smart Veil: a technology consisting of a thin composite membrane incorporating fiber optics placed on a complex path. This integrated element makes the monitoring system easy to use/handle, robust and reliable in real operating scenarios, capable of guaranteeing precise measurements. The effectiveness of this technological solution is proven by means of the manufacturing of a sensorized helicopter blade mockup. Among the several techniques that can be adopted using a fiber optic, FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensors have been selected, allowing a robust punctual measure in specific locations. The choice of sensors position was led by the idea to exploit a digital twin for shape reconstruction and load identification, so all the components of the relevant loads acting on a tail rotor blade during operation can be obtained: axial, beam bending, chord bending and torsion. All sensors benefit from the use of the smart veil that guarantees robust and precise measures. Particularly, the torsional sensors do, since they need to be placed on an ad hoc path.

Although conventional commercially AE sensors, like R15a and WSa sensors, have been extensively employed in monitoring many different structures, they are unavailable in restricted-assess areas. In contrast, thin PZT sensors are small, inexpensive and lightweight. These thin PZT sensors have a great potential for passive sensing to detect AE signals. However, their utility in AE monitoring is limited due to their low signal-to-noise ratio and information incompleteness because of their simple construction. This work discusses the issues and possible solutions with regards to the specific selection and application of thin PZT sensors for passive sensing. The compatibility of different thin PZT sensors and conventional bulky sensors is investigated using pencil break lead (PBL) tests.

The diagnosis process is simplified by using machine learning algorithms. The learning capabilities and classification performance of such machine learning models are mostly influenced by the quantity and quality of the input features. Thus, the appropriate selection of a subset of the most prominent features for machine learning becomes essential to eliminate redundancy of high dimension or irrelevant measurements of the features. In this paper, a filter-based feature selection technique is introduced to select the optimal feature space. A Gaussian ant lion optimization (GALO) is put in with a filter-based selection technique to select the feature subset from a high dimension feature dataset obtained from the vibration signals of centrifugal pump under different health conditions (normal, clogging, wheel cut and blade cut). The K-nearest neighbour (KNN) classifier is applied to the selected feature subset to find the classification accuracy. In addition, the proposed method has been compared with other art of work. The results reveal that the proposed GALO-KNN with filter-based feature selection technique outperforms both in feature reduction and classification accuracy and secures the best feature subset with less computational effort. Thus, the proposed method is capable enough to perform the selection task and shows excellent potential in fault diagnosis.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics']"

Generally physical inspections are carried out to detect defects in structures for further rectification. With recent advancements in computational algorithms, machine vision based inspection is emerging as an efficient technique for monitoring structural health of structures. Surface cracks in concrete structures are one of the important indicators of its health and enable the assessment of serviceability of the structures. The present work aims to address the issue by developing a novel system using machine vision and deep learning. A convolutional neural network-based methodology is developed to detect surface cracks in concrete cube images. The implementation of proposed methodology is demonstrated through monitoring of crack development in concrete cubes of size 150 × 150 × 150 mm with different compression strengths. The concrete cubes are subjected to compression loading in a standard compression testing machine. The analysis results in location, area, length, and number of cracks in synchronization with the applied compression load. The number of cracks, area of cracks, and length of cracks with respect to compression load are acquired using the developed system for different grades of concrete cubes. Results show that cracks detection and monitoring have been accurately performed with the developed system. The observations obtained from the crack load analysis can be very useful for improved understanding of concrete behaviour. The data acquired and observations can help professionals for improved structural health monitoring.","['Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences']"

In that period, the use of concrete as a building material spread considerably, favoring experimentation in geometries and structural schemes. If on one hand the innovativeness and uniqueness of these buildings have made them an essential part of our architectural heritage, on the other hand they make their study challenging. The complexity of these structures’ dynamic behavior results in the uncertainty on the sensitivity to possible damage scenarios and environmental factors, which represent a relevant aspect in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). This paper reports the results of a sensitivity analysis of changing environmental conditions on a concrete historical building, composed by blocks divided by structural joints. The case study is the Pavilion V of Turin Exhibition Center, built by Riccardo Morandi in the late 50s. The research conducted on the pavilion’s Finite Element Model (FEM) allowed to show the effects of the variation of the elastic modulus of the structure’s components on the modal parameters for different temperature sensitivity scenarios and, consequently, to extract useful information for an upcoming permanent monitoring.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Faculty and students experienced significant disruptions in their instruction, mentoring relationships, and other activities as they rapidly transitioned to an online platform (Levine et al., Voices from the Field: The Impact of COVID-19 on Early Career Scholars and Doctoral Students , American Educational Research Association (AERA), 2021). More worrisome, the pandemic exacerbated existing challenges for Black and Latina/o/x students. Many students of color have withdrawn from their graduate programs due to the added strain, stress, and disproportionate impact of the pandemic on Communities of Color. A primary concern for universities is the low persistence and degree completion of students of color (Gardner, New Directions for Higher Education , 2013 , 43–54, 2013). The vast disparities in graduate degree completion contribute to low faculty representation across institutions (Kamimura-Jimenez, & Gonzalez, Journal of Hispanic Higher Education , 17 , 148–168, 2018). A factor in the low persistence and degree completion rates for students of color is the quality of mentoring relationships that help students navigate their academic journey. This chapter explores the unique challenges facing students of color encounter and the ways graduate departments can implement and refine support systems to meet student needs. The chapter offers several recommendations for graduate programs, departments, and faculty to implement specific interventions to support students of color through improving mentoring relationships.","['Education', 'Higher Education', 'Education, general', 'Ethnicity, Class, Gender and Crime', 'Sociology of Education']"

The analyses provide an overview of these trends in France, the UK, and the United States. The data, alongside a strategic review of other studies and sources, provide a picture of shopping and mobility during the pandemic. Shopping, and especially e-commerce, result in important, albeit difficult-to-predict transportation changes; thus, this chapter outlines a discussion of how the onset of the pandemic and the corresponding health restrictions might have impacted this relationship. We find that time spent at non-home locations decreased dramatically, while e-commerce transactions saw an increase. Immediately after public health restrictions were set in place, initial purchasing behaviors suggest some hoarding or stockpiling, followed by a clear increase in e-commerce transactions. Time spent at grocery locations decreased less than time spent at retail locations, which can be explained by the subsistence and maintenance nature of grocery shopping. Moreover, by June 2020, people in France and the United States were spending approximately the same amount of time in grocery locations as before the pandemic.","['Engineering', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Urban Studies/Sociology', 'Public Policy', 'Cities, Countries, Regions', 'Epidemiology']"

A common theme throughout our research efforts is the judicious combination of theoretical exploration, numerical simulation, and experimental measurements. Both passive and active SHM methods have been pursued. The active SHM research has focused on detecting various types of composite damage using guided-wave interrogation and sensing. The composite damage considered covered both seeded delaminations and barely visible impact damage (BVID). The passive SHM research was focused on recording acoustic emission (AE) wave signals created during fatigue loading of aerospace-grade sheet-metal coupons. The AE signals were analyzed for finding specific signatures associated with fatigue crack growth. It was found that not all AE signals were associated with fatigue crack growth, some resulting from the interaction of the faying surfaces. The NDE research was focused on developing novel methods for damage detection with particular focus on composite materials. Remarkable results were obtained in using angle beam transducers (ABT) to selectively excite either quasi-S0 or quasi-SH0 guided waves in composite materials. Eddy current methods were used to detect composites flaws and damage.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

doi:10.1007/s12273-022-0926-8,en,Development of a Bayesian inference model for assessing ventilation condition based on CO2 meters in primary schools,"['OriginalPaper', 'Research Article']","Outdoor fresh air ventilation plays a significant role in reducing airborne transmission of diseases in indoor spaces. School classrooms are considerably challenged during the COVID-19 pandemic because of the increasing need for in-person education, untimely and incompleted vaccinations, high occupancy density, and uncertain ventilation conditions. Many schools started to use CO 2 meters to indicate air quality, but how to interpret the data remains unclear. Many uncertainties are also involved, including manual readings, student numbers and schedules, uncertain CO 2 generation rates, and variable indoor and ambient conditions. This study proposed a Bayesian inference approach with sensitivity analysis to understand CO 2 readings in four primary schools by identifying uncertainties and calibrating key parameters. The outdoor ventilation rate, CO 2 generation rate, and occupancy level were identified as the top sensitive parameters for indoor CO 2 levels. The occupancy schedule becomes critical when the CO 2 data are limited, whereas a 15-min measurement interval could capture dynamic CO 2 profiles well even without the occupancy information. Hourly CO 2 recording should be avoided because it failed to capture peak values and overestimated the ventilation rates. For the four primary school rooms, the calibrated ventilation rate with a 95% confidence level for fall condition is 1.96±0.31 ACH for Room #1 (165 m 3 and 20 occupancies) with mechanical ventilation, and for the rest of the naturally ventilated rooms, it is 0.40±0.08 ACH for Room #2 (236 m 3 and 21 occupancies), 0.30±0.04 or 0.79±0.06 ACH depending on occupancy schedules for Room #3 (236 m 3 and 19 occupancies), 0.40±0.32,0.48±0.37,0.72±0.39 ACH for Room #4 (231 m 3 and 8–9 occupancies) for three consecutive days.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"

In non-destructive testing, the reliability is quantified through probability of detection (POD) curves, which are often limited to damage detection and cannot be applied to structural health monitoring applications where no data from the damaged state is available. To fill this gap, a method is developed in this paper that allows one to create probability of localization curves (POL curves) based on measurements from undamaged structures. The approach is based on statistical damage localization tests and requires a finite element model. For proof of concept, the method is applied to a simple numerical structure, demonstrating that it is a powerful tool to analyze the performance of SHM systems before damage occurs. The findings demonstrate that the POL increases with an increasing number of observed modes of vibration, an increasing measurement duration, an appropriate sensor layout, and low measurement noise levels.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

However, there is wide cultural, geographical, and temporal diversity into the questions of for whom, when, what, and for how long. For the most part, admission is used to manage medical risk primarily by supporting eating, although suicidal symptoms are also an issue. Research into this area is limited but wherever possible we cite systematic reviews. Much of the limited available evidence comes from specialized centers linked to academic departments and may not represent practice as a whole. Recent developments include research into the optimal rate of refeeding and into psychological interventions that may support eating. Also there has been research into components of the care pathway such as the key admission and discharge parameters of inpatient care and community aftercare. Managing the gaps between hospital and home and other parts of the service needs further work. Many questions and uncertainties remain.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology, general', 'Nutrition', 'Nursing', 'Gastroenterology']"

One example is the COVID-19 epidemic that humankind is currently experiencing, since around December 2019. Innovation is key to respond rapidly and effectively to sanitary and health emergencies, when human lives are severely threatened. In this scenery, medical devices that can be rapidly launched in the market and manufactured at scale are crucial for saving lives. One example is a lifesaving respiratory device launched in about 10 days (Mercedes F1 team’s new device based on continuous positive airway pressure devices) and rapidly approved by international agencies responsible for assuring drug and medical devices safety, in response to the COVID-19 burden. Remarkably, it is the first time in history that mankind observes disease spread reaching such high proportions, globally, in such short time scale. However, while this epidemic had, in March 2020, reached the critical figures of about 38,000 deaths and c. 738,000 infected, organ donation and transplantation patients are suffering for years, accounting for an increasing number of affected, annually. These patients are invisible for the general public. Therefore, this chapter approaches the organ donation and transplantation burden, proposing effective solutions to leverage the suffering, improving life quality of patients enduring several underlying issues, from hemodialysis complications and critical organ failure to lacking compatible donors. This, on the basis of technology repurposing, to speed up approval processes followed by international agencies responsible for assuring drug and medical devices safety, while adding innovative methods to existing technology and reducing invasiveness.","['Life Sciences', 'Biological Techniques', 'Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences/Technology']"

Therefore, this study aims to identify the relationship between river ecosystems and benthic macroinvertebrate ecological indices for river health assessment. There were a total of five sampling sites selected along Sungai Mengkibol, Sungai Madek and Sungai Dengar in Johor. Benthic macroinvertebrates and six in-situ parameters were collected and measured. Meanwhile, riparian river compositions, canopy cover, large woody debris, substrate compositions and velocity were measured for assessing the river habitat. Ecological indices were analysed and correlated with other parameters. The results obtained reaffirms that river discharge had an influence (p < 0.05) on the composition of the benthic macroinvertebrates caught in the sampling area. Rivers that have reached canopy cover recorded a higher diversity, richness, evenness indices and EPT taxa compared to the least or those of poor canopy cover. The results obtained from the chi-square test shows that there is a significant association (p < 0.05) between physicochemical water quality with dominance index, evenness index and EPT composition. Thus, it can be concluded that benthic macroinvertebrates can be used as bio-indicator to assess river health.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Water, general', 'Pollution, general']"

This literature review collects and investigates the latest available research on photocatalytic wastewater or organic pollutant degradation using carbon-based materials in textile industrial wastewater treatment. Materials such as carbon have been used in several studies to enhance photocatalytic performance due to superior properties such as small particle size, high specific surface area-to-volume ratio, high reactivity, excellent chemistry, high thermal stability, wide availability, and catalytic potential on the nanoscale. Heterojunction formation is one of the most effective methods for increasing charge separation efficiency and reducing photogenerated electron–hole pair recombination. There are many ways to increase the photocatalytic performance for carbon-based material, such as heterojunction formation, using g-C 3 N 4 or zinc oxide/carbon nanocomposite as a photocatalyst, surface modification to improve electron transport efficiency in semiconductor particles, using a green hydrothermal method to synthesize a hierarchy of graphene oxide/zinc nanocomposites, and more. Interestingly, the membrane separation technique explains the removal and recovery of synthetic colors from wastewater, which is a potential technical route. Functional composite membranes integrating photoelectrocatalysis and membrane filtration have been the subject of recent research. Finally, carbon-based materials are prospective to improve photocatalytic reaction due to their adsorption capability.","['Materials Science', 'Energy Materials', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Environmental Chemistry', 'Energy Storage', 'Environmental Management']"

At the same time, the need for nursing homes has increased. As the number of elderly people in nursing homes increases, the number of elderly people living there cannot be considered individually. And nowadays, people are not willing to work in such places. Because they have to work without pay or at low wages. About 95% of seniors in nursing homes have poor health. And their behavior patterns are very different. For these reasons, the authority to manage nursing homes faces a major challenge. They have a big role to play in giving each adult proper medication and healing their mental level. As a solution to this problem, authors hope to compare it with technology and provide a solution. Authors decided to create the relevant items and software for this. This is done using an adult friendly handrail and camera system in the proposed methods. Advanced ML, image processing and hardware parts are used in this technology world. This allows you to focus on each adult 24 h throughout the day.

Nonetheless, significant challenges exist for testing and validating in a physical environment. This paper proposes a virtual reality framework for developing autonomous UAV-based structural health inspection systems. The framework, built atop a gaming engine, implements algorithmic virtual sensing and control of a UAV that flies virtually in a complex built environment. In this paper, we test this framework with a virtual UAV with an open-loop control approach for structural health inspection, including waypoint-based control and simultaneous localization and mapping. We further discuss its full potential as an aerial robotics learning and validation platform for developing advanced data-enabled structural-space exploration, optimal control, and damage assessment.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-07258-1_14,en,Piezoresistive Sensors for Monitoring Actions on Structures,OriginalPaper,"In the context of climate change, environmental actions on structures are likely to alter in terms of intensities and frequencies of occurrence. To ensure sufficient load-bearing capacity of structures despite these changes, actions may be monitored using structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. Environmental actions involve time-dependent and non-scheduled loads, e.g., wind and snow loads. In current SHM systems, these loads are mostly traced locally. However, local monitoring may cause inaccuracies, as certain load phenomena, such as wind turbulences, or snow accumulations in specific parts of structures, may not be registered. A holistic, global recording of loads acting on structures has rarely been established since a multitude of sensors is cost intensive, and the integration into the building envelope is challenging. This paper investigates slender layered piezoresistive sensors to measure loads resulting from environmental actions, focusing on wind and snow loads. The sensors operate based on changes of externally applied pressure, leading to variations in the electrical resistance of a piezoresistive material. Next to strategies for quantifying structural loads using sensor technology, first, alternatives of force sensors are discussed. Subsequently, the low-cost technical fabrication of the piezoresistive pressure sensors is presented, and implementation, calibration, and validation of the pressure sensors are conducted. Finally, the validation results of the sensors are discussed, and an outlook on future work is presented. In summary, the sensors investigated offer a wide range of applications for monitoring structural actions on surfaces, serving as a basis for estimating the load-bearing capacity of structures reliably.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Testosterone (T) is involved in the modulation of all steps of sexual response from the activation (sexual desire) to the resolution (orgasm and ejaculation). Androgen receptors are deeply expressed in several brain areas involved in the control of sexual response as well as in the male genitalia tract and corpora cavernosa. At these levels, T plays a crucial role in all pathways of penile erection, including nitric oxide (NO) production and degradation, adenosine signaling, calcium sensitization, and penile smooth muscle differentiation. In addition, T is also involved in the control of ejaculatory reflex modulating male genitalia tract contractility and semen bolus expulsion. The role of other sex steroids is more limited, although estrogens seem to partially regulate male sexual desire. Thyroid system is mainly involved in the control of the ejaculatory reflex, although a possible contribution in the modulation of sexual desire and penile erection has also been supposed. Available evidence suggests that prolactin (PRL) acts in the control of sexual desire either through indirect (inducing secondary hypogonadism) or direct mechanisms (modulating dopamine and serotonin central pathways). The role of other hormonal pathways in the regulation of male sexual response appears negligible.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Urology', 'Reproductive Medicine', 'Endocrinology']"

To benefit from the operational assessments and improvements through the use of a DT, the integration of structural analysis should be addressed. To connect DTs to their physical counterparts during the whole service life, changes during the lifetime, e.g., due to fatigue or damage, must be detected, quantified and evaluated. The suitable tool to achieve this goal is Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). This contribution examines the state of the art for DTs in the context of structural applications. Furthermore, the role of SHM as a necessary condition for the realisation of DTs is discussed. With the help of the SHM levels according to Rytter, a method is proposed to select the required information depth for adapting the DT to a changing physical twin. Only after detecting a measurable deviation (Level 1) it is necessary to apply more detailed models to assess changes in the structural behaviour. These considerations are illustrated by the example of a cantilever beam structure.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Natural rewards and drugs of abuse can trigger similar changes in the neurobiological substrates that drive food- and drug-seeking behaviors. This review examines the impact natural rewards and drugs of abuse have on perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs are specialized extracellular matrix structures that ensheathe certain neurons during development over the critical period to provide synaptic stabilization and a protective microenvironment for the cells they surround. This review also analyzes how natural rewards and drugs of abuse impact the density and maturation of PNNs within reward-associated circuitry of the brain, which may contribute to maladaptive food- and drug-seeking behaviors. Finally, we evaluate the relatively few studies that have degraded PNNs to perturb reward-seeking behaviors. Taken together, this review sheds light on the complex way PNNs are regulated by natural rewards and drugs and highlights a need for future studies to delineate the molecular mechanisms that underlie the modification and maintenance of PNNs following exposure to rewarding stimuli.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Psychiatry', 'Neurosciences', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Biological Psychology']"

Although the behavior of Lamb waves has been dealt with in depth, there are still topics where research is needed, for example, the influence of prestress on Lamb wave propagation. In order to gain profound insight into this area, experimental methods and results on wave propagation under the influence of prestress have been presented in previous work by the authors. These results are characterized by the use of a 2d Fourier transform to evaluate the observation of this behavior over large frequency ranges. Based on these results, the work presented here deals with a 2d numerical modeling approach of the wave propagation in a prestressed structure. The focus is on analyzing the suitability of linear and non-linear material models for reproducing the wave velocity changes. For this purpose, the numerically obtained results for different material models are compared with experimental data. The numerical data is generated using a FE model which combines a nonlinear static computation for the prestress and a linear eigenfrequency computation for the dispersion behaviour of Lamb waves. Finally, the comparison of simulated and experimental data will provide a well-founded basis for further numerical analysis on this topic.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Transplant patients show substantial reductions in mortality and cardiovascular events, as well as improvements in quality of life. However, the capacity of health systems to deliver kidney transplantation varies worldwide with worse indicators in low-income countries. Consequently, exploring novel and better therapeutic options for CKD is mandatory. Cell-based therapy is a promising strategy for treating CKD in preclinical models, and several clinical trials involving kidney disease exhibit a favorable safety profile. This chapter aims to provide an overview of CKD and the recent results of clinical trials of cell therapy in kidney diseases.","['Life Sciences', 'Biological Techniques', 'Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences/Technology']"

Animal models represent a valuable tool in the study of the molecular and biochemical basis of social behaviors. Dominant–submissive relationship (DSR)-based models have been developed in both mice and rats for the purposes of studying the molecular basis of social behavior and psychotropic agent screening. These models have been established on the basis of the food competition paradigm. Whereas DSR models have been proven to be valid for drug testing, they have also been associated with different challenges, including low efficiency, experimental reproducibility, and testing time duration. To overcome these challenges, we employed the selective breeding approach, which has allowed us to develop mouse populations with strong characteristics of dominance and submissiveness. This model allows a dramatic increase in test efficiency, stability, and reproducibility as well as a substantial decrease in experimental duration. The selectively-bred dominant (Dom) and submissive (Sub) mice exhibit distinct differences in (a) stress-coping abilities, (b) responses to psychotropic agents, (c) inflammatory profiles, (d) gut microbiome profile, and (e) life span. Herein, we describe in detail the process of selective breeding as well as the behavioral, biochemical, and physiological characteristics of the Dom and Sub mice. We also discuss the different research directions that can be pursued by employing this model.","['Biomedicine', 'Neurosciences']"

The best examples are virtual assistants such as Siri, Alexa, Cortana, etc. Cognitive computing and AI play a big role in solving problems and building applications to support several domains in Internet of Things (IoT). The downside to AI and cognitive computing is the complexity of the architecture involved in building models that supports IoT. Toward the late 1960s, researchers came up with a technology called cloud computing that allowed individuals and organizations to make use of services provided by the cloud to solve problems. This meant that one no longer needed to worry about the software and hardware components required to develop intelligent models. Although cloud computing has been able to solve most complexity issues, it has several drawbacks of its own – latency, privacy, security, reliability, etc. Domains like healthcare rely on intelligent models to make important time-sensitive decisions and cannot wait for data to be shipped all the way to the cloud to get results. The need for quick and real-time results is what probed researchers to develop Edge Intelligence or Cognitive Computing at the Edge with IoT application services. Edge Intelligence is the deployment of intelligent computerized models close to the data source – on the edge node of an IoT network or very near to the network edge. This chapter highlights and examines the principles, architecture, challenges, applications, and existing industrial implementations of Edge Intelligence.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Computer Communication Networks']"

In spite of these challenges, Croatia managed to contain the infection in spring 2020, but reopening to facilitate tourism has led to a spike in cases in early summer and very high infection rates in the autumn–winter. This chapter traces the perceived politicisation of the handling of the crisis and explains how this led to a breakdown of citizens’ trust in government. The perception that the lifting of restrictions was linked to early parliamentary elections—won resoundingly by the ruling party—and aimed at capitalising the good early handling of the crisis led to lower trust in government. This was later deepened by scandals concerning the flouting of rules by political and business elites. From a bottom-up perspective, the persistent cultural phenomenon of rejecting the authority of institutions, as well as the perception of the government as a “puppet” of big capital, underpinned a shift in the understanding of political agency and democratic participation.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Comparative Politics']"

Within the indoor air quality research at Lviv Polytechnic, experimental measurement of carbon dioxide (next CO 2 ) concentration and air temperature in a selected room performed was. During the measurement, students were in the room, who carried out the subjective air quality assessments in the form of questionnaires. From the obtained measurement results, the current and the required air exchange were calculated. Furthermore, the required air exchange was calculated, using the total weight of the persons situated in the room. An analysis of the measured parameters of indoor air and a subjective assessment of indoor air quality performed was in this work. From the analysis of measured and calculated values of air parameters, it confirmed that the rate of increase of the CO 2 concentration to the weight of the people in the room is directly related. The analysis of the subjective evaluation confirmed that indoor air quality also affects the accuracy of subjective assessment.

However, even with these advancements, some pertinent issues related with uncertainty in remaining useful life predictions are still open for investigation. One such area of interest is on how to account for the distribution of these predictions such that all uncertainty sources are duly captured and represented. Practically, these uncertainty quantification procedures must be computationally feasible for real-life deployment and reflect real-life situations devoid of strong assumptions. This article thus, proposes a data-based prognostics technique that uses a set-based quantification of uncertainty based on the set-membership paradigm, the interval predictor approach.

Today, there is a wide diversity of students in schools around the world. In particular, one of the groups that requires special attention is that composed of children who have a rare disease (RD), a highly heterogeneous group that needs an educational response adapted to their academic, health and social needs, eliminating any contextual barriers in order to facilitate a more inclusive environment. This chapter—based on a study carried out in Spain—is concerned with the need to give a voice to children and adolescents with RD and their families to ensure good inclusive practices for their schooling based on their own experiences and opinions. What emerges from the results, unexpectedly, at different times and from different voices, is that the term “association” is central to this chapter, that is, its importance and role both for children and young people with RDs, and particularly for families. Following an analysis of the results, the study concludes that, due to the information they provide, RD associations are key to raising awareness about RDs in schools, particularly when it comes to promoting positive attitudes toward them among teachers and students. In short, in order to make progress in the educational inclusion of students with RDs, it is essential that the associations involved work together with the educational centers from a community perspective.","['Education', 'Education, general', 'Pedagogic Psychology', 'International and Comparative Education']"

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, seminal studies demonstrated the existence of cannabinoid receptors and other elements of the so-called endocannabinoid system. These G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a key element in the functions assigned to endocannabinoids and appear to serve as promising pharmacological targets. They include CB 1 , CB 2 , and GPR55, but also non-GPCRs can be activated by endocannabinoids, like ionotropic receptor TRPV 1 and even nuclear receptors of the PPAR family. Their activation, inhibition, or simply modulation have been associated with numerous physiological effects at both central and peripheral levels, which may have therapeutic value in different human pathologies, then providing a solid experimental explanation for both the ancient medicinal uses of Cannabis plant and the recent advances in the development of cannabinoid-based specific therapies. This chapter will review the scientific knowledge generated in the last years around the research on the different endocannabinoid-binding receptors and their signaling mechanisms. Our intention is that this knowledge may help readers to understand the relevance of these receptors in health and disease conditions, as well as it may serve as the theoretical basis for the different experimental protocols to investigate these receptors and their signaling mechanisms that will be described in the following chapters.","['Life Sciences', 'Biological Techniques', 'Pharmacology/Toxicology']"

As a result, there is a need to monitor cardiovascular stress and energy exertion that construction workers experience on a daily basis, and design a suitable work-rest schedule that is sufficient, yet does not delay the project. This paper, therefore, proposes a framework for an automated and near real-time data collection of workers’ physiological metrics such as heart rate and energy expenditure using wristband wearables. The paper then highlights the components of a framework that uses the collected data to design the work-rest schedule for on-site construction workers.

A novel method for assessing a user’s life quality score is presented, which employs a deep learning architecture. A convolutional neural network and a support vector machine (SVM) were coupled to develop this solution for multimodal data. Three tests were conducted to determine the accuracy of the estimation method. In the research on living standard estimation, eight life factors were chosen to make up life quality. Next, the regression of life quality score experiment gives scores of each parameter where the distribution of the difference between the actual and predicted outcomes is known as error of neural network. Except for the mental health category, these findings suggest that the attributes required for life quality assessment may be retrieved from data. One of the reasons why estimating the mental health scale was challenging might be because the learning framework was unable to extract an adequate feature for estimation. As a result, we used eye movement to determine mental health. It was shown that estimate is achievable, and the suggested approach employing different modes of activity data proved efficacy for estimating makeup life quality, as well as for extracting high-dimensional information about a human’s life quality, such as their pleasure level toward social activities.

The proposed procedure relies upon surrogate modeling based on a multi-fidelity (MF) deep neural network (DNN), conceived to map damage and operational parameters onto sensor recordings. Within a stochastic framework, the MF-DNN is adopted by a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling procedure to update the probability distribution of the structural state, conditioned on noisy observations. The MF-DNN enables to locate and possibly quantify the presence of damage, and its multi-fidelity configuration effectively blends datasets featuring different fidelities without any prior assumption. The training datasets are generated with physics-based models of the monitored structure: high fidelity (HF) and low fidelity (LF) models are considered to simulate the structural response under varying operational conditions, respectively in the presence or absence of a structural damage. The MF-DNN is a composition of a fully-connected LF-DNN, which mimics sensor recordings in the undamaged condition, and of a long short-term memory HF-DNN, which is exploited to enrich the LF approximation for the considered damaged scenarios. By framing the model updating strategy as an incremental or residual modeling problem, the MF-DNN is reported to provide numerous advantages over single-fidelity based models for SHM purposes.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

It does so through the dynamic formation of action situations that incentivize and nurture the desirable capabilities for collaborative practice.  A worked example is presented to illustrate how the IAD framework works for this purpose. Following an in-depth review on IPD and safety literature, which defined a set of safety capabilities for IPD practice, the system designer set up initial IPD-oriented game rules which incentivized actors’ experiences that nurture such capabilities. The  reflective analysis results highlight three key perspectives in mobilising the IAD framework for safety capabilities development: (1) an organic power division between top-down design and bottom-up development of institutions; (2) an inclusive project front-end that involves actors in problem-framing activities; and (3) capabilities development as a process of shifting logics. Practically, the results inform effective training and coaching of practitioners at the teambuilding stage of IPD projects to configure safety as an integral attribute of the project system.

We also propose an integrated framework to the resilience paradigm that complements and maximizes the performance of individual building components in climate response. Based on this proposed framework, future work will investigate specific relationship between building components and develop integrated solutions that can establish best practices for resilient building design and operation and inform building standards and regulations.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

In addition to shape sensing, i.e. the computation of displacements, different Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications based on iFEM are available in the literature. These are mainly focused on the detection and localization of the damage, without attempting damage size estimation. The latter can be performed with different approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks, however, a prior knowledge of the different damage scenarios would be required. To overcome this issue, the present research proposes a novel iFEM approach to estimate the damage size without creating any database of damage models. The damage is included in the model to decrease the discrepancies between the physical structure and its model. In particular, the damage size is systematically increased until the strain discrepancy between the experimental measurements from sensors and the numerical strain reconstruction is minimized. The technique is experimentally verified on an aluminum plate subject to fatigue crack propagation. The strain field as input to the iFEM is measured with an Optical Backscatter Reflectometry (OBR) fiber and with Digital Image Correlation (DIC).","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Water handling equipment is pervasive in our society, to the point it is often overlooked; including plumbing, faucets, bathtubs, showers, toilets, water heaters, water softeners, filtration systems, dish washers, washing machines, etc. Monitoring of the health and usage of water equipment will be a major contribution to the internet of things, providing information about equipment’s need for maintenance or re-placement to both conserve water and prevent costly flood damage. Detection of leaks and flow rates are core to monitoring the condition of water equipment. However, commercially available flow meters capable of measuring flow on the order of a dripping leak are too expensive for mass deployment in consumer products (>$300). This paper presents parametric studies of low cost in-line flow meter designs, intended to measure extreme low flow rates (<50 ml/min on the order of a dripping leak in ½ inch pipe). Designs were created based on a hybrid of traditional orifice and target meters. Part counts were kept minimal and synthesis methods were kept simple with the goal of minimizing cost. Parametric studies were performed to evaluate the effects of geometric dimensions on the sensitivity, pressure drop, and other traits of the flow meters. Testing was performed both with custom equipment and in the Badger Meter Flow Lab at the Global Water Center in Milwaukee Wisconsin. Results were compared to electromagnetic and mass-based measurements.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

As a young woman she called for attention to the need for a healthy environment, reaching out to politicians at home and abroad. In the 1970s Brundtland was active in many areas, including the environment. As cabinet minister she earned the nickname green goddess. She was chair of the United Nations (UN) commission that produced the famous report Our Common Future (1987); its concept of sustainable development has become a guiding principle in the international fight against climate change and poverty. Yet Brundtland has been criticized for taking controversial environmental measures as Prime Minister, arising from the dilemma of how to combine the employment question with environmental requirements. This issue is exemplary on a smaller scale for the larger one of how to attack the environmental problem worldwide. Gro Harlem Brundtland was also a role model as first female Prime Minister of Norway (in 1981, 1986–1989, and 1990–1996), plus at age 42 the youngest ever. Second most influential woman PM in the West after Great Britain’s Margaret Thatcher, who governed from 1979, Brundtland breached the glass ceiling in an impressive way as PM. The priorities in Brundtland’s career were the world’s climate concerns, the concomitant poverty problem, and – in Norway – emancipation and socioeconomic policy. The underlying factor that brought these together was the social democratic concept of equality. Until recently she was active on behalf of the UN.","['Social Sciences', 'Environment Studies', 'Environmental Geography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Development and Sustainability', 'Sustainability Management']"

As a precaution, they are mandated to fly below a prescribed, lower load limit. In the presence of damage, the structural load carrying capabilities are reduced as the damage grows, posing a safety issue. A primary goal of a real-time Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system is to detect a damage, under normal operating scenario, well before the damage reduces the structural integrity, in terms of hindered ultimate load carrying capabilities and, more strictly, limit load carrying capabilities. An SHM design tool is proposed for the quantitative assessment of the margin between a robust detection of a damage at a known load and the ultimate load characteristics of the structure, as a function of platform loading and damage size. When a digital twin is available and the aircraft loading spectra are known, it is possible to simulate the dependence of properly processed readings of a given SHM sensor-net as a function of aircraft loads and damage size. These data can then be arranged into an SHM design map that characterizes the SHM detection threshold in terms of aircraft loading envelope, damage size and structural load carrying capabilities. In the present work the concept of such an SHM design map is presented and applied to a digital twin, representing a damaged wing spar cap. It is also experimentally tested using a a fiber-optic-based SHM system, which monitors a spar-to-skin de-bond.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Development and fabrication of biocompatible nanoparticles, nanocomposites, nano-scaffolds, nanowires, etc., and their stable conjugation with biological molecules indeed came out fruitful in developing nanomaterials and nanodevices for diagnosing and treating life-threatening human diseases. Nano-sized smart materials possess several unique structural and functional traits like controlled bioactivity, superior penetration ability, and sustained action over the treatment time. All these properties have led to the inclusion of several metals and non-metal derived nanomaterials as well as hybrid nanocomposites for diagnosing different infectious and inflammatory complications of humans. Nowadays, nanobiosensors can efficiently trace the affected tissues or diseased organs while targeted delivery of nanoparticles or drug-loaded nano-cargo can provide a suitable outcome within less treatment schedule. However, several important parameters of the nanocomposites like size, drug-loading methods, dose of the drug/nanoparticle-drug conjugate, and bioavailability are of major concern to yield the desired efficacy of a nanoformulation. Alteration or disproportion in any of the aforementioned parameters could induce toxic side effects.

However, it remains uncertain whether serum SHBG mediates the association between intrahepatic lipids (IHL) and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we studied whether, and to what extent, serum SHBG mediates the association between IHL content and type 2 diabetes. Methods We used cross-sectional data from the Maastricht Study ( n =1554), a population-based cohort study with oversampling of individuals with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes status was assessed by oral glucose tolerance test, and IHL content was measured using 3T Dixon MRI. Mediation analyses were performed to assess the role of serum SHBG in mediating the association between IHL content and type 2 diabetes. Results IHL content was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes in women and men (OR 1.08 [95% CI 1.04, 1.14] and OR 1.12 [95% CI 1.08, 1.17], respectively). Serum SHBG significantly mediated the association between IHL content and type 2 diabetes. The contribution of serum SHBG was higher in women (OR 1.04 [95% CI 1.02, 1.07]; proportion mediated 50.9% [95% CI 26.7, 81.3]) than in men (OR 1.02 [95% CI 1.01, 1.03]; proportion mediated 17.2% [95% CI 9.6, 27.6]). Repeat analyses with proxies of type 2 diabetes and adjustment for covariates did not substantially affect the results. Conclusions/interpretation In this large-scale population-based cohort study, serum SHBG was found to be a mediator of the association between IHL content and type 2 diabetes. These findings extend our understanding of the potential mechanisms by which NAFLD is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, and further elaborate on the role of SHBG as a hepatokine.

Although competitive pressure was weak, exporting companies and local subsidiaries of multinationals deployed the Japanese quality control model, which was considered the hallmark of the Japanese industry’s competitiveness. Individual companies and local business associations were the leading promoters of quality control, with the collaboration of JUSE. The first boom fell short of expectations because of the lack of understanding from corporate managers and some inter-cultural problems for workers in introducing Total Quality Control. The market liberalization since the 1990s set new ground for competitiveness-seeking quality control, supported by the government. The second boom did not materialize because of the industrial paradigm change for machine-based productivity gains, while Japanese style quality control is human-based. Still, we find that Japanese style quality control has been effectively used in non-industrial sectors such as public administration and healthcare. We argue that Japanese technical cooperation capitalizing on quality control methods will enhance Brazil’s labor productivity and social well-being.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'International Relations Theory', 'International Relations', 'International Economics', 'Globalization', 'Diplomacy']"

A recent critical review compiled previous models established for the evaluation of safety culture. A need still exists for a maturity model that covers the most important factors of the existing validated models and proposes an approach to maturity evaluation. The aim of this study is to design a new maturity model for measuring and analyzing safety culture. Fourteen safety culture maturity models that had been assessed for validity or reliability were selected, analyzed, and compared. The most common themes and evaluation criteria for safety culture were used as a basis for the new model. The five main themes of the model were communication, training, organizational learning, management commitment, and employee commitment and involvement. The model evaluates maturity by combining written descriptions of best practices and the overall satisfaction of employees in the evaluated aspects. The perspective of employee satisfaction with safety culture acknowledges the need to fit the practices into contextual needs. The model is unique because of its balance between rigor (validated content from the literature) and relevance (written evaluation levels).

The CMD is a recently proposed method that extracts single mode components from measured multimodal free structural responses. These components can be then processed, in time domain or in frequency domain, for identification of modal parameters, and ultimately, for structural health monitoring. The aim of the CMD is thus similar to the aims of other well-known mode decomposition approaches, such as the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) or the variational mode decomposition (VMD). However, in contrast to the EMD, the CMD-processed responses retain the characteristics of the free response (satisfy the equation of motion of the same structure) and they have thus a clear, well-defined physical meaning. In comparison to the VMD, the formulation of the CMD is much simpler: the CMD combines linearly recorded structural responses in a way that simultaneously (1) amplifies the selected modal component and (2) constrains/suppresses other components. The amplification/suppression process is quantified in terms of the FRF peaks or, in case of closely spaced modes, in terms of FRF derivatives.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

People around us are facing challenges due to various reasons that can be stressful and can also cause strong emotional unbalance in adults and children. All the public health actions like social distancing, to stay isolated, has lead people to be not only stressful but also anxious, which directly affects health and tends to worsening of chronic health problem. Also, working under such conditions is not recommendable and henceforth in this paper we stated that using non-invasive method how we can early detect the level of stress and then the individual can take respective precautionary measure against it. Since any type of stress can be fatal, thus need of stress detection is most important. Various methods exist to detect stress like Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Electromyography, Electrocardiogram, and Positron Emission Tomography which can help to quantify stress in an individual’s body. EEG is physiological features produced by brain’s electrical activity, and thus, we get the voltage difference when we take EEG signals form brain scalp it is a non-invasive method. Also, the EEG signals are precise and reliable so it is better option to be considered for stress detection. We have considered various classifiers and compiled a detail analysis of all, and among that, we got the maximum accuracy for SVM. Output expected from this project is to detect stress so that further diseases can be prevented and one can lead to happy, healthy, and productive life.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

Ever since the first case was reported in Wuhan city of China in December 2019, the virus has spread over 223 countries. Understanding and predicting the dynamics of COVID-19 spread through data analysis will empower our administrations with insights for better planning and response against the burden inflicted on our health care infrastructure and economy. The aim of the study was to analyze and predict COVID-19 spread in Ernakulam district of Kerala. Data was extracted from lab data management system (LDMS), a government portal to enter all the COVID-19 testing details. Using the EpiModel package of R-mathematical modeling of infectious disease dynamics, the predictive analysis for hospitalization rate, percentage of patients requiring oxygen and ICU admission, percentage of patients getting admitted, duration of hospital stay, case fatality rate, age group and gender-wise fatality rate, and hospitalization rate were computed. While calculating the above-said variables, the percentage of vaccinated population, breakthrough infections, and percentage of hospitalization among the vaccinated was also taken into consideration. The time trend of patients in ICU showed men outnumbered women. Positive cases were more among 20–30 years, while 61–70 years age group had more risk for ICU admission. An increase in CFR with advancing age and also a higher CFR among males were seen. Conclusions: Analyzing and predicting the trend of COVID-19 would help the governments to better utilize their limited healthcare resources and adopt timely measures to contain the virus.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics']"

This living space is described by Christian Norberg-Schulz (Norberg-Schulz C (1979) Genius loci: Paesaggio, ambiente, architettura. Electa) as consisting of many spaces: a pragmatic space in which people satisfy their biological needs; a perceptual space; an abstract space of pure logical relations; a cultural space in which people find their collective activities as a community; and an expressive space related to art as an interpretation of change. In this spatial composition, man projects his image of the world into his environment in order to feel at home. And when the world becomes an interior, man is capable of dwelling, which then implies something more than shelter. Dwelling integrates both concepts of house —the shelter, the dimension of intimacy, comfort, pleasure and security, and the response to our biological needs; and home —the cradle of the inhabitant’s existence with its thoughts, memories and dreams, man’s primary world. A duality that is similarly found in the definition of care : a diligent and caring concern for a subject/object, which engages both our soul and our activity—caring for someone or something, actively looking after it, providing for its needs both physical and psychological. The link between the concept of care and living goes back to the ages and is not even referable to the human species alone. It is therefore necessary to identify a closer temporal and geographical span to try to trace some fundamental transitions and degrees of influence between the two terms, for this reason the period considered starts from the nineteenth century till today, and it took into account mostly the Western Countries.","['Business and Management', 'Employee Health and Wellbeing', 'Business and Management, general', 'Urban Studies/Sociology', 'Public Health']"

These include Condition Monitoring (CM) in rotating machinery as well as Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) for civil structures. However, several distinct entropy definitions are available in the scientific literature, each with its advantages and limitations. In the present paper, the potential of the family of Rényi entropies is evaluated. The order $$\alpha$$ α is varied between 0 (corresponding to the Hartley entropy, i.e., the Max-entropy) and $$+ \infty$$ + ∞ (Min-entropy), encompassing $$\alpha \to 1$$ α → 1 (Shannon-entropy) and $$\alpha = 2$$ α = 2 (Collision entropy) as particular cases of special interest. The Wigner-Ville (WV), Smoothed Pseudo Wigner Ville (SPWV), Discrete Choi-Williams (DCW), and Continuous Wavelet (CWT) transforms are all tested for the time-frequency (TF) distribution of the target signal. In turn, this TF is used to compute the probability density function, from which the ISE is estimated. A sensitivity analysis is run on all the parameters for each candidate TF transform, aiming at defining the best settings. All studies were performed on a well-known experimental dataset, the three-storey aluminium frame structure developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratories, considering the undamaged conditions as the normality model. The results show good potential for entropy-based real-time damage detection, especially for breathing cracks.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Even we discuss indoor or outdoor, our health status and comfort depend on the air that we breathe. The negative effects can be immediate or long-term. To maintain the air quality, we need to monitor the values of the parameters that influence it. The paper presents a distributed IoT system for indoor air quality monitoring. The acquisition process from humidity, barometric pressure, ambient temperature, and gas sensors is accomplished by a small board computer integrated into each module that communicates with a server to upload data automatically at certain time intervals. The software keeps a history of the monitored parameters that can be displayed in numerical or graphic format for each room, allows the setting of predetermined intervals for these parameters, and generates alarms when the limits are exceeded. The Indoor IoT Air Quality Monitoring Module is low-cost and has low-power consumption. It was designed as an open platform, ready to be changed to monitor outdoor air quality. For doing this, other sensors can be connected, such as a GPS that would identify the geographical location to generate maps for monitored parameters, respectively other communication modules, such as GSM, to connect from places where the WiFi signal is not present. Including a MicroSD module, an independent data-logger can easily be obtained. The system is implemented in university rooms where the educational process takes place, offering an image of indoor air quality.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

The studied structure is a steel railway bridge subjected to cyclic loading, equipped with 98 Fiber Bragg Gratings.

This research aims at predicting this damage through machine learning with available operational data as input (train type, train speed, ...) and adding publicly available data (temperature, humidity, ...). The research uses 4 months’ data of train passages and focuses on passenger trains, as too few freight train passages were recorded. Random Forest regression was selected for its ease of implementation with categorical data and high R-squared score. A model was trained for every sensor point. Additionally, the model classifies sensors based on damage predictability. Finally, the models were used to determine long-term damage caused by different bridge loading scenarios. By fixing a parameter like train type and then randomly sampling from train passages, the remaining train passages until a damage threshold is reached are estimated. By repeating this simulation 1000 times for every scenario, remaining train passages distributions are reached, showing best and worst case estimates.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

The fast-paced development of cheaper but reliable devices has allowed to collect a huge amount of data to deepen the knowledge of the structural behavior over time of existing structures under service conditions. This paper shows the use of MEMS sensors, both clinometers and accelerometers, for continuous structural health monitoring on concrete bridges. A dense sensing monitoring approach is applied, and data are analyzed and compared in near-real time with a threshold set based on an updated reference FE model of the bridges. A case study is presented, where anomaly detection algorithms based on key performance indicator evolution in time have efficiently identified and localized damages triggering repeated proactive maintenance interventions. Attention is given to the seasonal influence on both the static and dynamic response of the bridges, and on the misleading effects on the damage detection and diagnostics processes. This approach is part of a wider framework aimed at an industrial application of SHM, in which the specific aspects covered in this paper have been identified and analyzed on multiple similar concrete bridges under continuous monitoring, of which evidence is provided.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

It also implies attention to people in their wholeness, that is, as characterized by resources but also by fragility; by physical, psychological and social needs that characterize them in a qualifying and not defective way; by conflicts and the need to live together and meet even when they are unresolved; by ordinary and extraordinary health recovery processes (“health gain” and recovery, W.H.O. in Health Promotion Glossary, 1998 ), since individuals and communities are very rarely in a state of full and ideal health; by ethical tensions sometimes resolved in a socially desirable and high-profile way and sometimes not. “Taking care” is consistent with a dynamic vision of reality, characterized by evolution and change, which pays attention to the systemic processes that facilitate the overcoming of difficulties and impasses through the emergence of discontinuous living conditions with respect to the past. From the point of view of design, “taking care” takes concrete form in the exercise of attention to the quality of the relationships between all the actors involved, as the domain of the relationship cannot be separated from that of perception, imagination and affects (Bateson et al. in Behav Sci 1:251–264, 1956 ).

Such a mechanical behavior makes masonry constructions particularly prone to brittle collapses when subjected to seismic loading. In light of this, structural health monitoring of masonry constructions, particularly for the existing ones, is of pivotal importance to evaluate the structural integrity of residential and cultural heritage buildings. In this regard, piezoresistive strain-sensing brick-like sensors, termed “smart bricks”, have been recently developed for structure-scale monitoring of masonry constructions. Smart bricks, indeed, can be easily integrated within masonry load-bearing structures made of conventional clay bricks, providing measurable variations in their electrical outputs correlated to changes in their strain states. This paper focuses on the use of smart bricks for seismic monitoring of masonry constructions by presenting an experimental program carried out to investigate their effectiveness in measuring strains within masonry walls. To this aim, smart bricks with standard dimensions were produced and installed in full-scale masonry walls with different mechanical characteristics, which were tested under diagonal compression. The results demonstrate that smart bricks can be effective to early detect shear-induced damages when employed in such structural settings.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

It is likely that the large growth of the Latino population is affecting the changing demography of cancer. This chapter features two analyses. The first analysis examines the absolute increases in cancer cases and deaths between 1999 and 2016 to assess the relative share of the growth that took place among Latinos. The second analysis develops projections of Latino cancer cases and deaths between 2016 and 2060 to determine the Latino share of the projected increase in cancer. The analysis was conducted with information from the CDC US Cancer Statistics public data and the US Census Bureau population projections. The results illustrate the growing presence of Latinos among cancer cases and deaths over the last 18 years and over the next four decades. The Latino incidence of cancer more than doubled and their number of cancer deaths nearly doubled between 1999 and 2016. The findings also suggest that these trends will intensify between 2016 and 2060. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the policy implications of the results.","['Biomedicine', 'Cancer Research', 'Social Structure, Social Inequality', 'Public Health', 'Ethnicity, Class, Gender and Crime', 'Health Care Management', 'Latino Culture']"

Through either chemical or physical actions, the FFCs increase the ignition delay time and reduce the fire intensity, the spread of fire and the consumption of fuel, delaying also the recovery of the combustion process. Long-term FFCs are water solutions of fire retardants (usually ammonium sulphate or phosphate salts) and other chemicals to improve their application with ground or aerial equipments (thickeners, colouring agents, corrosion inhibitors and bactericides); their effectiveness mainly relies on the dose of retardant applied and remains even after the carrying water disappears. Short-term FFCs, either foams or gels, are also water solutions of different chemicals (foaming agents, wetting agents, foam stabilizers, dispersants, super-absorbents, corrosion inhibitors), but their effectivity depends mainly on their ability to increase water retention by fuels and disappears once water is evaporated or drained out. During wildfire fighting, FFCs may enter into contact with all components of the target ecosystem; therefore, care must be taken because they contain a wide variety of chemicals with potential deleterious effects on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and eventually on human health after ingestion or prolonged contact. As the environmental impacts can be important, mainly due to the high N and P content of long-term FFCs and the surfactant ingredients of short-term FFCs, in the last decade increasing efforts have been undertaken to develop more environmentally friendly FFCs.","['Engineering', 'Fire Science, Hazard Control, Building Safety', 'Environmental Health', 'Climate Change/Climate Change Impacts']"

Global shocks (e.g., war, economic recession, pandemic) can severely disrupt these interconnections and generate cascading consequences across local to global scales. To comprehensively evaluate these consequences, it is crucial to use integrated frameworks that consider multiple interconnections and flows among coupled human and natural systems. Here we use the framework of metacoupling (human–nature interactions within as well as across adjacent and distant systems) to illustrate the effects of major global shocks on the evolution of global interconnectedness between the early 1900s and the 2010s. Based on these results we make a few actionable recommendations to reduce the negative impacts of an ongoing global shock, the COVID-19 pandemic, to promote global sustainability.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Physical Geography', 'Environmental Management', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

The aim of this chapter is to present the most important known risk factors for residential fire fatalities. This review of the literature concentrates on various characteristics of the individuals and households experiencing fatal residential fires Residential fires . We have chosen not to include various types of fire Fires safety measures in this review, such as smoke alarms Smoke alarms , fire Fires extinguishers, or mobile sprinklers, as these are the subject of another chapter. The literature studied provides a reasonably consistent picture of several basic risk factors for death in a residential fire Residential fires . With respect to age, the oldest have the highest risk. Among children, it is the youngest who have the highest risk. In all age groups, men are at greater risk than women. Smoking Smoking and alcohol Alcohol have a large effect on risk. Certain socio-demographic factors are clearly associated with higher risk, such as living alone, having a low income Income , or being unemployed. In addition, individuals with functional limitations Functional limitations are at greater risk than others. These risk factors have been observed to hold true over an extended period of time in several countries, despite a gradual decrease in the mortality Mortality rate from residential fires Residential fires in the last decades. We note that much of the research on risk factors is relatively old, and many studies are of a descriptive nature. It is clear that many of the risk factors identified in the research are correlated. It is desirable that future studies take more account of covariation between the various risk factors and control for confounding factors. In addition, large-scale population-based case-control or cohort studies have the potential to provide a deeper understanding of risk factors for residential fire Residential fires fatalities.","['Engineering', 'Fire Science, Hazard Control, Building Safety', 'Psychology, general', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Public Policy', 'Building Construction and Design']"

We explore the effects of the pandemic on local option sales taxes (LOSTs), an increasingly common revenue source for transportation in California and across the U.S. LOSTs have many advantages over alternative finance instruments, including that they can raise prodigious amounts of revenue. However, LOSTs rely on consumer spending, which lags during times of economic weakness. This is precisely what we observed in California counties during the initial months of the pandemic. LOST revenues did recover after the initial economic shock of COVID-19, albeit to a lower level than they would likely have otherwise. LOST revenue trends during the pandemic were affected by national and regional economic conditions and government policy as well. This public health crisis illustrates both the pitfalls and resilience of LOSTs during economic downturns and recoveries. The lessons from the pandemic’s effects on LOSTs will be useful for policymakers and analysts in preparing for inevitable future crises and associated economic turbulence.","['Engineering', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Urban Studies/Sociology', 'Public Policy', 'Cities, Countries, Regions', 'Epidemiology']"

Meanwhile, the executive’s efforts to depoliticize the management of the crisis by justifying much of its decision-making on technocratic grounds clashed with the efforts of certain actors to politicize the pandemic. However, the fractious political environment did not necessarily prevent the government from adopting the decisions it deemed necessary to manage the crisis.

These home treatment programs can be subdivided into two general approaches: acute outpatient intervention to prevent hospital admission and stepped-care intervention to shorten hospital stays. Both approaches have already been performed successfully in adolescent anorexia nervosa, but not in other eating disorders. The first aim of this chapter is to provide a rationale for implementing home treatment settings for patients with eating disorders. Secondly, it aims at illustrating home treatment programs specifically developed for patients with adolescent anorexia nervosa. Two programs will be presented in detail, including their concepts, management, and schedules. Furthermore, data of pilot studies examining the effectiveness of these programs will be depicted, showing promising effects. To summarize, this chapter shows that home treatment seems to be a promising treatment approach for adolescent anorexia nervosa, both to prevent hospital admission when applied within an outpatient setting and to shorten hospital stays after initial admission. However, data are preliminary and scarce. In addition to the urgent need of confirming the existing pilot data on the effectiveness of home treatment in adolescent anorexia nervosa, future research should focus on the implementation of home treatment programs to the broader field of eating disorders.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology, general', 'Nutrition', 'Nursing', 'Gastroenterology']"

We analyse how SE evolved for a certain birth cohort (respondents born between 1945 and 1953) along time, to gain a life-course perspective, and for the same age group in two different periods, to study how the situation of individuals in later life stages has changed from one period to the other. Our paper explores the recently updated data from the European Social Survey (ESS, Round 9 – 2018), combined with data from Round 1 – 2002, to obtain an insight into the evolution of SE among the older population in 15 European countries, by producing measures of SE including different domains (Social Relations, Civic Participation, Neighbourhood and Community and Health and Well-being). The same birth cohort (respondents born between 1945 and 1953) is analysed in 2002 and in 2018. We investigate the association of SE with the type of participation in the labour market, which, according to the rules developed by the welfare state institutions, is expected to change for that cohort, between the two periods. And, indeed, we find evidence of such association. Differences between the situation of men and women are highlighted, with higher levels of SE experienced by women in most domains.","['Social Sciences', 'Life course', 'Labor Economics', 'Aging', 'Social Structure, Social Inequality', 'Sociology of Work']"

This step is important as environmental and operational conditions should correspond in both cases. Commonly, selecting a reference case for damage detection in SHM is performed manually. As this approach is not effective, we introduce the Optimal Baseline Selection method based on analysis of frequency maps of examined structure. The operating object is recorded with the use of a high-speed camera. Vibrations are analyzed using the optical flow technique. The mean frequencies of motion in selected bands are calculated for each pixel. Frequency maps are obtained independently for vertical and horizontal directions of motion, and they are further processed separately. The analyzed frequency map is compared to the maps in a reference set to find the most similar one. This is basically achieved by computing differences between histograms of maps and further calculating statistical measures. Finally, the results obtained for individual directions of motion are combined. The method is demonstrated by an example of a compressor operating under different pressures and damages.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Certainly, there are many positive aspects of sociability , such as engaging with others in reciprocal social relations, allowing for the pursuit and accomplishment of collective goals considered valuable and which enhance well-being. However, there are also negative aspects of sociability , explored in this chapter and in Chaps. 2 , 4 and 7 , reflecting how social relations are often oppressive and unjust for certain individuals and groups. The central claim defended here is that examining the character of these social relations, reveals conflicting interpretations of ‘self-consciousness’ derived from contrasting epistemological and normative understandings of ‘false consciousness’, and ‘self-knowledge’. These conflicting interpretations are also found in very different accounts of ‘radical politics’ concerning how well-being is best understood and promoted – notably for oppressed and socially excluded groups, such as disabled people, focussed on in this chapter. Subsequently, a number of other related issues are raised and explored here.

Finally, MNCs are required to address not only social challenges at the BoP, but also environmental challenges (SDGs 13) in both emerging and developed countries. To balance these overall SDG-related challenges with MNCs’ own interests, BoP business is further evolving into SDG Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) business management, and MNCs will be increasingly required to redefine their role from a sustainability perspective.","['Economics', 'International Economics', 'Development Studies', 'Environmental Economics', 'Microeconomics', 'Economic Growth', 'Operations Management']"

The information accumulated via an SHM system is crucial in making appropriate maintenance decisions over the life cycle of the structure. An SHM system is feasible if it leads to a greater expected reward (by making data and risk-informed decisions) than the intrinsic cost (or investment risk ) of the information-acquiring mechanism incurred over the lifespan of the structure. In short, the value of information acquired through a feasible SHM system manifest into net positive expected cost savings over the life cycle of the structure. Traditionally, the cost-benefit analysis of an SHM system is carried out through pre-posterior decision analysis that helps one evaluate the benefit of an information-gathering mechanism using the expected value of information (EVoI) metric. EVoI is a differential measure and can be mathematically expressed as a difference between the expected reward and investment risk . Therefore, by definition, EVoI fails to capture the compounded savings over the life cycle of the structure (since it quantifies absolute savings). Unlike EVoI, we quantify the economic advantage of installing an SHM system for inference of the structural state by using a normalized expected-reward (benefit of using an SHM system) to investment-risk (cost of SHM over the life cycle) ratio metric (also called a risk-adjusted reward in short) as the objective function to quantify the value of information (VOI). We consider monitoring of a miter gate as the demonstration example and focus on the inference of an unknown and uncertain state parameter(s) (i.e., damage from loss of contact between gate and wall, the “gap”) from the acquired sensor data. This paper proposes a sensor optimization framework that maximizes the net expected compounded savings achieved as a result of making SHM system-acquired data-informed life cycle management decisions. We also inspect the impact of various risk intensities of decision-makers on the optimal sensor design.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Civil Engineering']"

To deal with the challenge of online and in-service structural health monitoring (SHM) for wind turbines, approaches based on the vibration-response of the structure and captured by sensors such as the accelerometers need to be considered. This work presents a novel methodology to improve the structural damage classification of wind turbine foundations. This methodology consists of several stages. First, the data acquisition to collect and organize the information from the sensors attached to the structure, following the use of a mean-centered group scaling (MCGS) procedure to normalize the raw data and eliminate the difference between the magnitudes of the sensors. Next, a data unfolding to allow the multivariable analysis is performed. Then a linear feature extraction stage is applied to reduce the high dimensionality of the signals. Subsequently, the new feature array serves as the input to a supervised machine learning algorithm which allow to perform the classification task. A five-fold cross-validation procedure is used to obtain the goodness of classification. Several classification performance measures are calculated considering an imbalanced data set obtained with experimental data of a small-scale wind turbine foundation structure to validate the results of the proposed methodology.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

A scaled-down bridge prototype was tested under pedestrian motions to capture and locate the artificial damage at different locations. Modal frequencies, damping ratios and modes shapes are identified in healthy and damaged states and compared to localize the damage. Piezo sensors are able to detect and localize the damage effectively and are found to be superior to the accelerometers for sensitivity towards the damage. Modal assurance criteria (MAC) is estimated to compare the mode shapes and localize the damage. MAC successfully captures and localize the damage due to change in the mode shapes.

Online prognostic health management is an emerging field dedicated to the timely prediction of RUL using onboard sensors. This work presents a mechanics-informed approach to the prognosis of a typical airframe element, stiffened CFRP composite panel, under compression-compression fatigue. The fatigue degradation of axial stiffness is monitored by Lamb wave velocity and utilised for online RUL prediction via particle filter.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

These pathways, levels and fuels influence species to be analyzed and matrixes for the analytes. As generic environmental impact of fires is an increasing topic nowadays, ISO is developing a series of documents [1, 2]. There are many variables to be considered when evaluating the environmental impact of fires. Some of these variables have an impact on combustion efficiency and environmental impact [2]. Depending on the particular fire conditions there can be other variables that need to be considered [3]:Soil moisture content also plays an important factor in smouldering fires, which are non-negligible in term of emission. In fact, smouldering of forest fuels is responsible for a significant fraction of the pollutants emitted into the atmosphere during a wildfire. Smouldering (peat, duff, hummus.) fires play a major role in the global emission to the atmosphere, the destruction of carbon storage in the soil and the damage to natural environment. It has been reported that peat fires can consume around 50% or more of the total burned biomass in temperate and boreal fires [7]. Typical example on its impact close to urban areas are the fires around Moscow in June 2010. The 2007 Anaktuvuk River Fire was an unusually large fire that occurred in the tundra of the Alaskan Arctic [8]. This fire burned 1039 km 2 of the tundra on Alaskas North slope, which had not been disturbed by fire for more than 3000 years [8]. The fire burned deeply into organic peat soils releasing enough carbon into the atmosphere to offset all of the carbon taken up by the entire arctic tundra biome over the past quarter-century [9]. This shows that the effects of wildfires are not limited to threats to ecosystems but can offer positive feedback into climate change processes as CO 2 released from ancient carbon stocks will result in further warming.","['Engineering', 'Fire Science, Hazard Control, Building Safety', 'Environmental Health', 'Climate Change/Climate Change Impacts']"

This opens new possibilities for personalized intelligent health and coaching applications. In particular, there is a need for more than simple recommendations and mechanistic interactions. Recent studies have identified nutrition virtual coaching systems (NVC) as a technological solution, possibly bridging technologies such as recommender, informative, persuasive, and argumentation systems. Enabling NVC to explain recommendations and discuss (argument) dietary solutions and alternative items or behaviors is crucial to improve the transparency of these applications and enhance user acceptability and retain their engagement. This study primarily focuses on virtual agents personalizing the generation of food recipes recommendation according to users’ allergies, eating habits, lifestyles, nutritional values, etc. Although the agent would nudge the user to consume healthier food, users may tend to object in favor of tastier food. To resolve this divergence, we propose a user-agent negotiation interacting over the revision of the recommendation (via feedback and explanations) or convincing (via explainable arguments) the user of its benefits and importance. Finally, the paper presents our initial findings on the acceptability and usability of such a system obtained via tests with real users. Our preliminary experimental results show that the majority of the participants appreciate the ability to express their feedback as well as receive explanations of the recommendations, while there is still room for improvement in the persuasiveness of the explanations.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The way in which the woman manages these changes will be crucial to her child’s psychophysical well-being. Although a bit of ambivalence towards the baby is physiological, experiences that lead to the fear of being “bad mothers,” or even to refuse one’s own child, even if desired, may emerge. The woman’s attachment style is a strong determinant of the mother’s attitude towards her role and her offspring, which may be welcomed and cared for, or else rejected and harmed. Attachment theory, developed by Bowlby’s ethology-inspired studies, is a theoretical framework that guides the interpretation of emotion regulation and behavioral patterns of both the mother and her child within the process of caring. It defines a behavioral system intertwined with the caregiving behavioral system, meant to provide adequate care for the baby in need. According to this theory, attachment styles are active since the earliest years and are stable over the course of life. Therefore, a number of assessment tools for the adult population have been developed, the most reliable being the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI). Compelling evidence on the linkage between trauma and interpersonal violence is also available. As a matter of fact, the exposition to early relational traumas has been identified as a risk factor for re-enactments of the aggressive behaviors witnessed as a child. Attachment styles of both victims and perpetrators of violence have proven to be disrupted in specific, dysfunctional ways. From a recent review of the literature interesting results emerged. More specifically, the psychological features of mothers who have committed filicide, especially their state of mind with respect to attachment, have been little studied. A summary of this work, together with a thorough overview on attachment theory and the intergenerational theory of trauma, is provided within this chapter.","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Emotion', 'Personality and Social Psychology']"

It results in enhanced patient safety, minimum healthcare cost, improved healthcare service accessibility, and high operational efficiency in the healthcare sector. At the same time, high-quality care during pregnancy is essential to determine the probable difficulties earlier and guarantee the healthiness of mother as well as fetus. Several research works have been existed in the literature to monitor the maternal lifetime. But they are developed for a particular health issue and based on short-term data collection approaches. Since maternal monitoring necessitates long-term services, this paper designs an automated machine learning-based gestational monitoring framework in wearable IoT environment. The goal of this paper is to derive a new improved salp swarm optimization (ISSO) with extreme learning machine (ELM), called ISSO-ELM model for continual maternal health monitoring. The ISSO-ELM model encompasses different sub-processes namely data acquisition, pre-processing, classification, and parameter optimization. The presented model enables IoT devices and wearables to gather healthcare data about pregnant women. Then, the gathered data are pre-processed to remove the unwanted noise. Besides, the ELM model is employed as a classifier to determine the occurrence of difficulties. Moreover, ISSO algorithm is applied as a parameter tuning technique to optimally adjust the parameters that exist in the ELM model.

To this end, a survey was executed in which participants would be presented with a series of avatars with different visual styles, and their attitudes towards each of the avatars were recorded. The results fell mostly in line with preconceived hypotheses, that realistic avatars hold greater credibility but higher discomfort while stylized avatars generate increased affinity. However, some additional observations were made as to the discomfort caused by the improper combination of stylized and realistic elements within the same avatar. These results indicated that, for further development of the avatar’s visual style, a more comprehensive study would be needed to fine-tune the most adequate point between realistic and stylized.","['Architecture / Design', 'Industrial Design', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Digital/New Media']"

Most of them rely on extensive transducer networks, besides preliminary reference measurements of the structures. This originated a growing demand for hardware simplification and cost reduction of the wave-based SHM methods, driving the conception of new solutions enabling both: the reduction in the amount of sensors required for doing measurements, as well as a diminution of quantity of signals needed for the algorithms to work. The simplification in damage detection procedures can be achieved by using a novel type of special shaped frequency steerable acoustic transducers (FSATs). The spiral shape of these FSATs allows focusing wave energy in a certain direction, which is associated with their excitation frequency. Thanks to this property, presence of damage can be established by identifying signal reflections, while its localization can be determined based on time of flight and the relationship between direction of propagation and its spectral content. This article presents the concept of baseline-free damage detection using FSATs over an aluminium plate with point damage through Finite Element (FE) analysis. Numerical simulations were performed for several cases, varying excitation frequency and damage position.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

The concept of the Air Quality Index (AQI) has evolved internationally to determine air quality. However, a single universally accepted method is nonexistent. Each method incorporates its pros and cons. The popularly accepted methods fail to consider the synergistic effect of all pollutants in determining the air quality at a particular place. The Mahalanobis Taguchi System (MTS) can be used for such multivariate data to determine the air quality of a particular area which would consider the contribution of the most important pollutants and overcome the drawback. To accomplish this, data for seven prominent pollutants was collected for two different categories, i.e., clean and polluted regions. MTS calculates the Mahalanobis distance (MD) for both categories and establishes a scale to classify the severity of pollution. MTS also helps in the identification of the most useful variables which contribute toward the outcome. MTS has an edge over other methods with regards to the consideration of correlation between the necessary variables for pattern recognition. As an alternative to having a solitary air quality standard, MTS can prove useful to ascertain the air quality of a region locally by recognizing the pattern of clean air quality for the region and by comparing evaluate the pollution.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films', 'Energy Systems']"

This fosters the possibility to enhance the responsiveness and power management of the inspection system. To this end, particular attention should be warranted to the extreme–edge implementation of system identification (SysId) algorithms, which represent one of the most powerful means for dynamics analysis and, consequently, for vibration–based structural assessment. However, to implement this near–sensor processing, the design of an optimized hardware is fundamental. In this work, we fulfil this goal by proposing a novel smart accelerometer node, which is built on the combination of a wireless communication module, a high–performance microcontroller unit (MCU) and two tri-axial MEMS accelerometers, necessary to efficiently trigger the acquisition on energy thresholds while maximizing the energy saving. In normal operating mode, the MCU benefits from a clock frequency up to 80 MHz, Digital Signal Processing functionalities and a Floating Point Unit which make feasible the computation of SysId techniques at the extreme edge.

In this chapter, we apply an ecological system-oriented approach to present a theoretical framework that explains how the physical, social and psychological elements of a prison environment interact to support or inhibit rehabilitation. The result is an applied multilevel model of prison-based rehabilitation. This model hypothesises that the rehabilitative power of the prison environment emerges when its structural and relational components interact in ways that satisfy basic psychological needs; facilitate prosocial skills and knowledge transfer and support positive identity transformation. It is the emergence of these causal properties within the environment that allows the experience of prison to generate rehabilitative progress and success among those who are imprisoned. This causal model also provides theoretical guidance in the design and delivery of rehabilitative prisons as well as an empirical framework to examine the relationships between the multiple environmental elements and rehabilitation outcomes.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

It is known that many data-driven methods in supervised learning mode have been proposed for structural damage detection in recent decades, but they require large amounts of training data measured from not only undamaged structural scenarios but also various damaged structural scenarios. However, it is impractical to obtain an adequate number of damaged scenarios for the structures being in service to acquire sufficient training data, and labeling huge amounts of training data with specific structural scenarios is time-consuming and costly as well. In this study, the proposed unsupervised deep learning method uses the acceleration responses only measured from the undamaged scenario of an experimental structure as training data, and the acceleration responses measured from various unknown structural scenarios are taken as the testing data. Then, damage-sensitive features are extracted from the reconstruction losses between inputs and outputs of the trained unsupervised convolutional neural network. Finally, the technique of Mahalanobis distance is applied on the extracted features to perform damage detection. Overall, the proposed method provided high performance in damage detection with reduced tuning parameters, and the experimental studies showed an average 93.8% detection accuracy for a laboratory-scale steel building model with damage in the form of bolt loosening at some structural joints and a reduced cross-section column.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Fourier Analysis', 'Abstract Harmonic Analysis']"

Indeed, detecting rotor imbalances in wind turbines starts by first isolating and then assessing the energy of the 1P harmonic, leading to a feature that is efficient but not failure mode agnostic. While different engineered features can be used concurrently, some anomalies in the acceleration signal might remain undetected by the algorithm, even though they are visually noticeable to a human in the signal’s spectrogram. Thus, this project aims to build an AI algorithm capable of detecting anomalies in spectrograms, agnostic of their origin, providing an early warning for potential structural issues. The proposed algorithm infers spectrograms of acceleration signals through a deep autoencoder. Anomalies are identified based on a custom reconstruction error. A sensitivity analysis is performed for two types of anomaly, in which waveforms with different energy levels are artificially added to an acceleration signal measured from an offshore wind turbine (OWT). For a 1P harmonic anomaly representing 20% of the total signal energy, the proposed approach yielded an efficiency (AUC) equal to 96% thanks to a novel reconstruction error, which significantly increased the performances.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Many medical imaging modalities have proven to effectively diagnose these diseases and their progression in a noninvasive way. Out of all the available modalities, ultrasound is the preferred mode of examination for imaging soft tissue organs for disease prediction because of its ease of use, low cost, portability, and lack of ionizing radiation. The radiologists manually study these scans for making an accurate diagnosis of the underlying condition. However, ultrasound imaging is highly operator-dependent and its effectiveness is adversely affected because of the presence of speckle noise. Therefore, to overcome these issues and for an efficient disease diagnosis, different computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems have been developed by researchers using artificial intelligence techniques along with the metrological characteristics of the diseased part as visible on the ultrasound scan of the organ under study. The main purpose of the present chapter is to shed light on the different types of diseases that affect the soft tissue organs like kidney, liver, thyroid, breast and their sonographic appearances, and characteristics. The chapter further describes methodologies developed in recent existing literature (year 2017 onwards) for the classification of diseases using ultrasound images of these organs through a CAD system using state-of-the-art deep learning and machine learning methods. The chapter also gives an insight into designing an efficient CAD system for the classification of breast tumors.

It can be applied to perform SHM of bridges or other special structures to assess their condition after a catastrophic event or when required by authorities. The application interrogates the phone’s internal accelerometer to measure accelerations, then estimates the natural frequencies, and compares them with a reference data set through a machine learning algorithm properly trained to detect damage. The machine learning is fundamental to take into account the effects of operational and environmental variability on the damage detection. A server is accessed and used by the application to run most of the computational operations and store the data sets. As a customized SHM process, App4SHM follows four main steps: (i) structure identification; (ii) data acquisition; (iii) feature extraction, which calls the server to estimate the first three natural frequencies and stores them into a feature vector (observation); and (iv) damage detection, where a damage indicator is computed for each new observation, based on the Mahalanobis-squared distance. The damage indicator of the new observation is plotted, and a flag is raised green if the structure is undamaged and raised red if structural damage is suspected. To test the robustness of the application, the damage detection capability was tested on real data sets from two twin post-tensioned concrete bridges in Brazil under traffic and temperature variability. The natural frequencies obtained from the application were also compared with the ones estimated using data sets from a traditional data acquisition system.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-10274-5_23,en,"The Scientific Study of Religion/Spirituality, Forgiveness, and Hope",OriginalPaper,"Within both positive psychology and the psychology of religion and spirituality (R/S), forgiveness and hope are considered key virtues or character strengths. When relationships are beset by transgressions, engaging in forgiveness is related to hope that the relationship is repairable. When people participate in forgiveness interventions, they increase their hope. There are religious and spiritual, empirical, and theoretical reasons why forgiveness and hope are interrelated. We explore these reasons using an evidence-based theoretical model of forgiveness and relational spirituality, which is at the intersection of positive psychology and the psychology of R/S. The forgiveness and relational spirituality model combines basic and intervention research to conceptualize how R/S is related to forgiving. The model posits a sacred dimension to the interrelationships among the victim, offender, and transgression, which are embedded in a particular forgiveness-relevant event. We incorporate hope into this theoretical model and review recent scientific research (2012–2020) on hope, forgiveness, and R/S conjointly ( k =  27) and on forgiveness and R/S specifically ( k =  72). Almost all this research has been cross-sectional and correlational. We hypothesize causal connections to guide future research and propose ways to guide practitioners as they help people navigate relational forgiveness with more hope.","['Psychology', 'Positive Psychology', 'Religion and Psychology']"

Methods Prospective cohort studies in Finland, Germany, Sweden and the USA followed 24,662 children at increased genetic or familial risk of developing islet autoimmunity and diabetes. For the 1403 who developed IAbs (523 of whom developed diabetes), levels of autoantibodies against insulin (IAA), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA) and insulinoma-associated antigen-2 (IA-2A) were harmonised for analysis. Diabetes prediction models using multivariate logistic regression with inverse probability censored weighting (IPCW) were trained using 10-fold cross-validation. Discriminative power for disease was estimated using the IPCW concordance index (C index) with 95% CI estimated via bootstrap. Results A baseline model with covariates for data source, sex, diabetes family history, HLA risk group and age at seroconversion with a 10-year follow-up period yielded a C index of 0.61 (95% CI 0.58, 0.63). The performance improved after adding the IAb positivity status for IAA, GADA and IA-2A at seroconversion: C index 0.72 (95% CI 0.71, 0.74). Using the IAb levels instead of positivity indicators resulted in even better performance: C index 0.76 (95% CI 0.74, 0.77). The predictive power was maintained when using the IAb levels alone: C index 0.76 (95% CI 0.75, 0.76). The prediction was better for shorter follow-up periods, with a C index of 0.82 (95% CI 0.81, 0.83) at 2 years, and remained reasonable for longer follow-up periods, with a C index of 0.76 (95% CI 0.75, 0.76) at 11 years. Inclusion of the results of a third IAb test added to the predictive power, and a suitable interval between seroconversion and the third test was approximately 1.5 years, with a C index of 0.78 (95% CI 0.77, 0.78) at 10 years follow-up. Conclusions/interpretation Consideration of quantitative patterns of IAb levels improved the predictive power for type 1 diabetes in IAb-positive children beyond qualitative IAb positivity status.

Moreover, most countries had a hard time keeping up with the new mutations of COVID-19. Therefore, taking preventive measures to control the spreading of the virus, including lockdowns, curfews, social distancing, masks, vaccines, is not enough to stop the virus. However, using the new technologies to adapt the prevention measures and enhance the existing ones will be more efficient. Most countries have already developed their non-pharmaceutical interventions measures (NPIs), mainly contacts tracing solutions at the pandemic beginning. Using those mobile applications, the authorities were able to reduce the spreading of the virus. Nevertheless, the virus is evolving, mutating, and becoming more and more dangerous to survive. Therefore, these mobile applications have become less effective in facing the constant changes of the pandemic situation. To that end, the need for enhancing and evolving contact tracing became more urgent. The goal here is to control the spread of the new variants and keep up with the rapid changes happening around the world. In this paper, we will present a detailed view of the new solution built to take contact tracing to a new level, empowered by the Bluetooth Low Energy technology for communication, advanced encryption method for security and data privacy, as well as secured storage and data management to have a system capable of slowing the COVID-19 variants from spreading and save lives.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

When Claes Tingvall was appointed Director of MUARC, he introduced the concept of “Vision Zero” to Australia and, with it, the “Safe System” approach. While political leaders initially regarded a vision for zero deaths as unachievable, they supported the inherent logic of the Safe System. Initially the Safe System was applied as four independent pillars. While this lack of integration had limitations, it did enable road safety measures to move beyond road user behavior to focus more on safer road infrastructure and vehicle safety. The initial Safe System approach became “Towards Zero” an approach that accepts humans are fragile, and the road system designed to protect from death or serious injury was adopted across all Australia jurisdictions between 2004 and 2018. Public education has been used to introduce and explain Towards Zero and bring greater attention to the importance of purchasing a safe vehicle. Infrastructure investment has moved from a “blackspot” approach to the Safe System approach. However, shifting community and decision-makers’ understanding of the importance of speed limits being set to match the safety standard and design of a road remains a challenge. Future opportunities involve better integration of the components of the Safe System, focusing on serious injuries and improving strategy delivery, performance reporting, management, and accountability.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

Chatbots may be particularly useful before and after medical procedures when patients are at home. For example, while being in the preparation phase of a colonoscopy, a chatbot might answer patient questions more quickly than a doctor. It is more and more discussed whether chatbots may be the first entry point for (urgent) medical questions instead of the consultation of a medical expert, as there exist already well-established algorithms for such situations. For example, if a new medical symptom occurs, a chatbot might serve as the first expert to relieve a patient’s situation. Such situations are mainly driven by the trend that patients often have to wait very long for appointments with a proper medical expert due to capacity problems of the healthcare system. While the usage of supporting at home actions of patients with chatbot technologies is typically welcomed by medical experts, the use of this technology to replace them in their core competence, namely diagnosis and therapy, is generally seen highly critical. Apart from the domain side, it must be carefully considered what currently available chatbot technologies can do and not do. Moreover, it has also to be considered, how existing technologies can be established in such highly critical (e.g., if a chatbot gets the message of a patient that indicates to commit suicide) and interdisciplinary field, involving ethical questions as well as questions of responsibility and accountability. This work raises aspects that might be the basis for medical as well as technical experts to better collaborate for proper chatbot solutions. Concretely, an architecture is proposed that should serve as a reference for various medical and psychological scenarios. When using suitable technical solutions based on such architectures, we argue that many opportunities emerge, which can mitigate identified challenges significantly.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Health Informatics', 'Health Psychology', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction']"

To inspect, repair, and efficiently maintain these bridges, it is necessary to develop a monitoring technology. Accordingly, research have been conducted on a bridge response health-monitoring technology. In particular, the properties of bearings significantly influence the vibration characteristics of bridges. However, previous studies are yet to examine changes in bridge response due to the corrosion of hinge bearings. Using finite element analysis (FEA), this study aimed to investigate changes in the bridge response and modal parameters of cantilever-suspended girder bridges due to the corrosion damage levels of the hinge bearings. In the FEA, model-installed elastic spring was used shell elements. Furthermore, static and eigenvalue analyses were conducted. Static analysis demonstrated that the target bridge type exhibited more minor changes in its girder deflection due to bearing corrosion. In addition, the effects were quantitatively determined by altering the corrosion position of the hinge bearing in the bridge.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The framework emphasizes infrastructure systems and how they support community resilience through eight key elements. These elements provide the foundation for system assessments, management and governance of resilient infrastructure systems. Elements underpinning assessments identify the framework processes for evaluating existing or proposed systems and provide a strong basis for management and governance. The elements primarily underpinning management and governance identify the processes and tools needed to provide the outcomes to ensure resilient infrastructure systems; they also draw from and provide feedback for improving the other elements.

Additional issues of user-data privacy and legal jurisdiction currently lag the fast evolution of edge computing domain with IoT-based solutions. This requires policy framework to be discussed by vendors and Cloud service providers with the users for avoiding any legal pitfalls. We look at security issues in edge computing, an example of IoT-based Cloud service, hardware as the root of trust, and security in the multi-party cloud.

However, they can be masked by the interference of measurement noise and may be able to indicate only a fraction of the extent of the damage. In this paper, an effective noise-robust damage identification method is proposed. It extracts local anomalies based on two-dimensional curvature propagating flexural waves (2D-CPFW). To alleviate adverse effects of measurement noise on calculating 2D-CPFW, the continuous wavelet transform with a second-order Gaussian function is used as a differentiation operator. Three two-dimensional quantities, including the curvature of the 2D-CPFW, Teager energy of 2D-CPFW, and Teager energy of the curvature of the 2D-CPFW, are defined and they can intensify local anomalies caused by the existence of damage. To obtain a complete identification of damage extent based on the anomalies, a two-dimensional accumulative damage index is defined. A convergence index is introduced to determine the number of waveforms to be included when calculating the damage index. Effectiveness and noise-robustness of the proposed method are investigated in a numerical example of a damaged plate. Results verify that the proposed method is effective and noise-robust in identifying the location and extent of damage.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most relevant infectious problems in hospitals, which can occur in 2.6% of all surgeries. According to the literature, the main source of SSI is flakes released from the exposed skin of the surgical staff or patients. A very effective strategy to control the bacteria carried by airborne partitions responsible for SSI is to ensure proper ventilation. For the study, numerical simulation was used, namely the Ansys Fluent® program. For this, two mannequins were modelled inside an operating room, whose HVAC system incorporates an insufflation grid and three extraction grids. The simulation takes into account turbulence, radiation, the thermal exchanges between boundaries and fluid, as well as the DPM for particle tracking. The mannequins have an associated follicle skin release which is tracked in the operating room. Laminar flow is essential to promote the removal of contaminants and protect the surgeons and patients. The peripheral region shows the accumulation of airborne particles, requiring attention from Nurses and other medical staff. After the surgery, an interval of 20 min showed to considerable reduce contaminants concentration and avoiding possible contamination among patients.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Occupational Medicine/Industrial Medicine', 'Industrial and Organizational Psychology']"

The decrement of the natural frequency could originate from several factors. The structural system derives from the arrangement of four building materials: masonry (predominant), reinforced concrete (RC), timber and steel. Masonry is unlikely to suffer rapid decaying of their mechanical properties. Reinforced concrete (RC) and the embedded steel should not present decaying phenomena in the first years after built. Likewise, the steel plates which connect the Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) panels should not manifest a significant progression of corrosion in an indoor environment. Conversely, timber’s physical and mechanical properties, such as swelling and shrinkage, density, modulus of elasticity, strength have a time-dependent response, even in the long-term. Likely, the decaying of the natural frequencies depends on the CLT roof’s time-dependent behaviour due to the potential modification of its mechanical properties and boundary conditions (interaction with the steel plates, e.g.). This paper presents selected results from the basilica’s three-years continuous dynamic monitoring and discusses an elementary mechanical model representative of the dynamics transverse to the nave walls. The mechanical model described by a limited set of parameters drives the assessment of the CLT roof’s possible role in causing the detected decrement of the natural frequencies.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

For that reason, job resources can potentially contribute to have a better non-work life domain. The purpose of this research is to study how contextual resources, such as spouse behavior at home, can foster human flourishing through spill crossover, resulting in enriched outcomes in the work and home domain. We explore how support for work received from the spouse can lead to the generation of resources such as creativity, self-efficacy and strategic renewal. This chapter contributes to the work and family literature by introducing the concept of work supportive spouse behavior (WSSB), defined as behaviors exhibited by spouses that are supportive of their partner’s role in the workplace—this concept mirrors the family supportive supervisor behavior (FSSB) that denotes behaviors by supervisors that favor their employees’ role as family members.","['Business and Management', 'Organization', 'Industrial and Organizational Psychology', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Philosophy, general', 'Neuropsychology']"

Some authors suggested that psychopathic traits are difficult to treat and that therapeutic strategies may even worsen psychopathic traits, contributing to help young offenders to attain their antisocial behaviors in more successful ways. In turn, other authors argue that psychopathic traits are treatable, especially if identified during early stages of development (childhood or adolescence) and treated properly. This chapter intends to provide a review on robust studies testing the efficacy of (psycho)therapeutic interventions in reducing psychopathic traits among young offenders. Although scarce and limited, some of these studies provide promising results for the treatment of psychopathic traits among this high-risk population. One study found that multisystemic therapy (MST) was effective in reducing parent ratings of psychopathic traits among young offenders. Another study found that the PSYCHOPATHY.COMP program (an individual intervention based on Compassion Focused Therapy that was specifically tailored to reduce psychopathic traits as antisocial behavior through the promotion of a compassionate motivation) was able to reduce psychopathic traits, disruptive behavior, and to promote a compassionate motivation among young offenders (moderate to large effect sizes). Results on the efficacy of the PSYCHOPATHY.COMP also found that increases in self-compassion and decreases in fears of receiving compassion from others were crucial mechanisms for the reduction of psychopathic traits. Given the clinical and societal toll of psychopathic traits and related antisocial behavior in young offenders, there is an urgent need to develop evidence-based interventions, tailored to the specific mental health needs and characteristics of this high-risk population, contributing to the delivery of evidence-based treatments for the juvenile justice systems.","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Emotion', 'Personality and Social Psychology']"

HNSWs are mechanical waves that can form and travel in highly nonlinear systems, such as granular particles in Hertzian contact. The easiest setup consists of a built-in transducer in drypoint contact with the structure or material to be inspected/monitored. The transducer is made of a monoperiodic array of spherical particles that enables the excitation and detection of solitary waves. The transducer is wired to a data acquisition system that controls the functionality of the transducer and stores the time series for post-processing. In this paper, the design and testing of a wireless unit that enables the remote control of a transducer without the need to connect it to sophisticated test equipment are presented. Comparative tests and analyses between the measurements obtained with the newly designed wireless unit and the conventional wired configuration are provided. The results are corroborated by an analytical model that predicts the dynamic interaction between solitary waves and materials with different modulus. The advantages and limitations of the proposed wireless platform are given along with some suggestions for future developments.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic between February 2020 and May 2021 provides evidence of advantages as well as disadvantages of such systems. As long as actors on all levels held similar views on how to proceed and put cooperation before contestation and electoral considerations, reactions to combat the virus were very effective and met with the broad support of the opposition, regional governments, and citizens. Austria quickly introduced social-distancing measures, accompanied by generous financial programs to offset negative effects on the economy. Following established patterns of policy-making, government assumed the leading role, while corporatist actors were involved in the negotiation and implementation of the measures. As a result, the spread of Covid-19 remained low. Once policy differences between political actors increased and significant parts of the public became critical toward strict containment measures, cooperation was replaced by contestation. Austria still managed to avoid a medical disaster.

The contribution of animal protein to the advancement of human health cannot be underestimated; however, livestock agriculture has often been criticised for its impact on the environment and animal welfare. The consumption of highly processed meat has also been implicated in the causation of cancer, mainly due to the production of nitroso compounds (carcinogens) formed as a result of using nitrites and nitrates to process meat. To protect animal welfare, there are regulations in some countries which mandate that all animals must be stunned prior to slaughter to mitigate the pain associated with neck cutting. However, the requirement to stun prior to slaughter is inconsistent with the beliefs of some religious communities, particularly some Muslims and Jews.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Veterinary Medicine/Veterinary Science', 'Animal Physiology', 'Social Sciences, general']"

These methods usually assume that damage manifests itself as a deviation in the modal properties of the structure with respect to its normal conditions. Traditional procedures for modal parameters estimation require the use of a dense sensor arrangement and complex logic techniques, thus making them not particularly suitable for the case of large engineering structures, where the need for cost-effective monitoring solutions is of utmost importance because of the large number of substructures to be monitored. This paper proposes the use of simple statistical and spectral features as a mean to characterize accelerations signals. Starting from this set of features, the principal component analysis (PCA) is first used to reduce data dimensionality still preserving the relevant information about the structural conditions, then a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) procedure is adopted as a supervised machine learning method to classify different types of damage. The procedure is validated using the experimental data from the permanent monitoring system of the G. Meazza stadium grandstands of, where one accelerometer per stand is installed to get vibration data during the main events. Four grandstands located on the same ring and having the same nominal geometry are considered. The leading idea is to reproduce different scenarios where, due to the impossibility of imposing realistic damages, one grandstand is assumed to be the safe structure, while the others represent a proxy for small structural changes to be identified.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

A rather new approach to efficiently monitor the global strain field of a mechanical structure is to employ planar elastoresistive sensors as surface coating in combination with Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). Furthermore, the EIT approach simultaneously allows the monitoring for damages of the sensor area. The aim of this experimental research is the evaluation of homogeneous strain states under cyclic loading using planar elastoresistive sensors applying EIT. The purpose is to develop an experimental framework that involves various methods for strain evaluation (e.g., EIT, Montgomery method, strain gauge) in order to have a suitable test setup for new EIT evaluation methods and sensor material properties (e.g., set-in effect) including long-term behavior. In the future, this framework shall allow the investigation and improvement of EIT reconstruction for non-static loaded structures.

This program served as an overlay to the traditional family law paradigm of private attorneys and self-represented litigants. In the 1980s and 1990s, the program’s collection efforts broadened in scope beyond children receiving welfare to all children of two-parent households. The enforcement emphasis tilted the scales against those who are least able to pay—low-income noncustodial parents. The collection focus is currently switching to account for the financial hardships and travails that follow most adults, particularly fathers, and tailoring solutions fair to both parents. Many child-support-related fatherhood engagement programs address access and visitation issues and overcoming barriers that may limit fathers’ interactions with their children. Studies indicate that children’s adult success can be correlated to positive paternal contact (McLanahan et al. Ann Rev Sociol. 39:399–427. https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-071312-145704 , 2013).

In this work different parameters such as types of coating and twist pre-stress are investigated to enhance the measurement sensitivity of distributed FOS used in Rayleigh-Backscattering sensing (ODiSI-B manufactured by Luna Innovations), exposed to environmental and operational conditions of aircraft. To enhance the temperature measurement sensitivity, different UV curable materials including UV683, UV639 (manufactured by Permabond Engineering Adhesives Ltd) were adopted as the FOS coating. Comparing with the commonly used coatings such as acrylates and polyimide, these UV curable coatings show different temperature sensitivity, especially in low temperature range (−50 $$^{\circ }$$ ∘ C to 0 $$^{\circ }$$ ∘ C). However, this temperature sensitivity difference decreased significantly when FOS are mounted onto the surface of composite laminates due to the adhesive. To improve the strain measurement sensitivity, different coatings and the twist pre-stress are induced in FOS. Experiments confirm a small enhancement of strain measurement sensitivity with different coatings. A greater sensitivity enhancement is observed when twist pre-stress is induced before the tension experiment.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

However, for complex systems with noisy operational environments, many factors may influence the estimation of natural frequencies and other modal domain SHM features, such as varying mass distribution of bridges and the variation due to fluctuating temperature and unideal boundary conditions. For this reason, allying the mode shapes with the natural frequencies to forecast damages would pose a more robust solution. Among the techniques existent to perform damage detection, data-driven models, such as machine learning algorithms, are becoming widely used currently. For mode shape extraction, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been applied to imagery data, allowing to extract full-field mode shapes with a denser spatial resolution (quasi-full field) of the structure if compared to traditional hardware. Combining CNN with long short-term memory (LSTM) network will associate the temporal dependency of the frames with its features which will be more specific for SHM decision-makings. In addition, for the circumstances with low vibration amplitude and subpixel image resolution, applying phase-based motion estimation (PME) and phase-based motion magnification (PMM) allows to extract the natural frequencies with subtle motion magnified at the resonances aiding to emphasize the dynamic features desired. As the training of the deep learning model, a lab-scale truss structure was adopted with different load conditions in order to obtain the required data, and the performance is cross-validated.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

The Malawi Trauma Score (MTS) reliably predicts mortality at referral hospitals but has not been studied at district hospitals. We sought to validate the MTS at a Malawi district hospital and evaluate whether MTS is predictive of transfer to a referral hospital. Methods We performed a retrospective study using trauma registry data from Salima District Hospital (SDH) from 2017 to 2021. We excluded patients brought in dead, discharged from the Casualty Department, or missing data needed to calculate MTS. We used logistic regression modeling to study the relationship between MTS and mortality at SDH and between MTS and transfer to a referral hospital. We used receiver operating characteristic analysis to validate the MTS as a predictor of mortality. Results We included 2196 patients (84.3% discharged, 12.7% transferred, 3.0% died). These groups had similar ages, sex, and admission vitals. Mean (SD) MTS was 7.9(3.0) among discharged patients, 8.4(3.9) among transferred patients, and 14.2(8.0) among patients who died ( p  < 0.001). Higher MTS was associated with increased odds of mortality at SDH (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.14–1.29, p  < 0.001) but was not related to transfer. ROC area for mortality was 0.73 (95% CI 0.65–0.80). Conclusions MTS is predictive of district hospital mortality but not inter-facility transfer. We suggest that MTS be used to identify patients with severe trauma who are most likely to benefit from transfer to a referral hospital.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgery', 'Abdominal Surgery', 'Cardiac Surgery', 'General Surgery', 'Thoracic Surgery', 'Vascular Surgery']"

The importance of such wearable devices and data streams is key because of their low cost, but also because they facilitate the building of a large number of solutions to multiple health-based problems. Despite of the easy manipulation of both, devices and their data streams; the necessary processes from collecting data to final analyses passing by data transformation and variable creation present an important flaw such as, it is the security of such data in applications that is mandatory. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) enable systems to be endowed with characteristics such as resistance to information manipulation or resilience to the appearance of single points of failure. DLT have the potential to build wearable-based solutions offering characteristics that would allow building a wider range of possible solutions. This contribution introduces Phonendo, a platform for collecting data streams from wearable devices and publishing them on a DLT Infrastructure (DLTI).

The specific urban structure can affect microclimate because of the high radiation generated. On the other side, urban structure blocks the distribution of incoming wind. Urban structure changes how the microclimate influences the city. The successful urban structure can impact how outdoor open spaces are used meanwhile good open spaces are affected by how comfortable can be accepted. In addition, water and greenery space is an essential urban part and has a vital environmental implication in alleviating the urban heat island (UHI). This chapter analysed thermal comfort in cold coastal areas and tropical areas. Especially in the cold coastal areas, this chapter chooses 3 plots of land used for education, 2 used as parks, 6 for commercial use, 2 for industrial land, 11 for residential land, and 6 for other land-use types. Because the field measurement points are scattered throughout the city, and the numbers of measurement instruments and researchers are limited, the 30 points are divided into five groups. Through simultaneous tests at the same period and time interval, the degree of difference in the urban thermal environment under different land categories and building types is analyzed. Through research, we found that the coupling relationship between outdoor environmental performance (OEP) and BH is analyzed qualitatively at different ranges. The maximum R 2 is 0.9052, the minimum is 0.3813, and the average is 0.80, indicating an apparent quadratic polynomial relationship between AT and BH within 500 m. In addition, the coupling strength between BH and RH is relatively high. The coupling relationship between AT and BH appears to be the opposite of RH and BH. The data are also highly discrete, so there is no clear relationship between BH and WS. Coupling strength in the range of 100 m, 300 m, 700 m, and 900 m is not as strong as that of 500 m, showing higher data dispersion and a smaller R 2 value. So urban structures must be well designed to make wind release the heat trapped in the urban area. This chapter also takes urban green infrastructure of Tianjin in China as a case, using subjective and objective analysis and model simulation. Waterfront compound greenery’s cooling effect was found more significant at waterfront 3–6 m, where the location was suitable for construction. When the green lawn of the waterfront space was 12 m and the water shore’s geometric form was S-shaped, this could improve the cooling effect of water significantly. This chapter provides practical implications and useful guidance for the urban planning and design.","['Life Sciences', 'Urban Ecology', 'Sustainable Development', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Cities, Countries, Regions']"

This chapter presents the global fire-related injury mortality by demographic, geographic, economic, and temporal distributions. The problem with data limitations is also highlighted. The mortality rates are higher among the elderly population in most regions, with some exceptions in individual countries. Globally, women are overrepresented in fire-related mortality. When reviewing fire-related mortality by geographic regions and national income, the rates are generally higher in sub-Saharan African and Eastern European regions, as well as in low-income regions and countries with lower sociodemographic index. From 1990 to 2017, global fire-related mortality decreased by 46%, with large disparities across countries and regions. A standardized data reporting system and reliable national data collection procedures are needed to monitor global fire-related mortality adequately.","['Engineering', 'Fire Science, Hazard Control, Building Safety', 'Psychology, general', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Public Policy', 'Building Construction and Design']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-030-76505-7_49,en,Miscommunications Based on Different Meanings of “Safe” and Their Implications for the Meaning of Safe System,OriginalPaper,"While many countries are apparently adopting “Safe System” for road safety, the failure to deliver the vision of zero deaths and serious injuries continues in part due to the lack of a rigorous and agreed definition of “safe” in road safety. Multiple authoritative definitions of the adjective “safe” exist which may be categorized as probabilistic and absolute. While apparently similar, these definitions are in a fundamental sense inconsistent with each other. The probabilistic definition involves degrees of safety, through probabilities that harm is not likely or unlikely, or that there is little risk. The absolute definition presents safety as free from harm or not involving any risk or protected from danger. Road safety is currently communicated as though there is an agreed meaning of safe, but the vital conversation around what is meant by safe is not undertaken because the difference in usage of the term safe is not appreciated. For example, in road design and engineering, road design standards are generally developed to achieve this probabilistic definition of safety and not absolute safety: the road can be described as safe because it by itself (with perfect use) will not cause a crash, even though people still die on it. Based on the absolute definition of safe, such roads are not safe as unambiguously demonstrated by people dying on them. Calls for roads to be made safe employing the absolute definition are often met with the response that they are already safe (in the probabilistic sense), having been built to “accepted” design guidelines. The acceptance of the probabilistic definition of safe for Safe System hinders progress toward its fundamental aims of zero deaths and serious injuries. In order to achieve zero deaths and serious injuries, uniform understanding and acceptance of “safe” adopting the absolute definition is needed.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

The increasing application of satellite data in the field of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is due to the significant advantages that they should bring compared to the traditional monitoring techniques. In fact, satellite data can allow us to obtain information quickly not only on the structure of interest but even on the surrounding area. Satellite data can provide different kind of information based on their nature: interferometric satellite data can detect displacements with high accuracy; while other satellite data are able to provide geophysical information on the soil state (i.e., soil temperature, soil moisture, etc.). However, the interferometric data are generally applied separately from the other types of satellite data that are less used, so there is no combination at the moment in the SHM field. In this paper, an integrated use of different space-born data is proposed to understand if their cross-comparison can provide a more comprehensive overview of the structural behavior of a structure or infrastructure. As a benchmark, satellite data are applied to an ancient aqueduct, which is used to verify the proposed methods.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

An inclusive built environment facilitates their full participation and enjoyment of equal opportunities. To this end, it is necessary to remove the “manageable” environmental obstacles in our buildings. While many previous studies worked on inclusive design of built environment, little emphasis has been placed on the management issues. In particular, PWDs have often been ignored in the formulation and execution of crisis management or evacuation plan. Against this background, this chapter aims to provide a preliminary inquiry into how PWDs are treated in the context of disaster preparedness. Data were collected in Hong Kong through a survey on 16 residential developments and 8 in-depth interviews with PWDs and property managers. It is found that in none of the 16 residential developments investigated the property management agent had kept a register of residents with disabilities who might help in case of emergency or disaster (like flooding, fire, or terrorist attack). There was no clearly written protocol or manual for the property management personnel on how to assist these residents to evacuate from the buildings. No training was offered to the property management personnel to raise their disability awareness. The interviewed PWDs expressed that they were never told what they should do in case of emergency.

This approach is based on the interference of elastic Lamb waves generated by piezoelectric (PZT) sensors attached onto the surface of the thin joint and travelling through the adhesion area. The S0 Lamb mode is used to investigate the integrity of adhesive in bonded zone. Several transient wave packets with different driving frequencies were used to investigate bonded area. The main advantage of the proposed model is the ability to easily evaluate the length and position of a damage. Experimental campaign revealed that for fixed disbond length there is a given driving frequency at which the wave packet is attenuated. The main result is the simplicity of the proposed approach, interesting for future applications (i.e., online SHM on working structures).","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Common foodborne viruses such as norovirus, hepatitis A virus, and hepatitis E virus continue to pose a considerable burden on healthcare systems and the food industry, worldwide. These viruses are shed in high numbers, have high infectivity, and are stable in foods, and the environment. Growing consumption of food at high risk for viral contamination, such as fruits, vegetables, and shellfish, and the limited efficiency of conventional pathogen inactivation strategies in removing viral pathogens have made foodborne viral illness a growing, serious health and economic concern globally. Furthermore, globalization of food supply has complicated traditional surveillance activities and source tracking of contaminated products. On the other hand, emerging production, and recent technological advancements in the employment of big data, is having an increasing impact on improving food safety. For example, the advent of affordable genomics approaches, such as whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of food pathogens, is revolutionizing food safety, and genomic data is becoming critical for accurate risk assessment and risk mitigation during foodborne outbreaks. However, because of the low number of infectious viral particles and lack of efficient enrichment systems, WGS analysis of foodborne viruses from contaminated foods is often challenging. For this reason, innovative methodologies have been developed and employed to obtain genomic data from contaminating foodborne viruses. In this chapter, we will discuss the current state of the science regarding the methodologies used for generation of big data for foodborne viruses, such as compiling genomic data, and its application in epidemiological studies, risk assessment, and management activities. In addition, we will discuss the gaps in knowledge, and future perspectives on how to harness big data for the improvement of the virological safety of food.","['Life Sciences', 'Food Microbiology', 'Big Data', 'Big Data/Analytics', 'Food Science']"

Using ultrasonic guided waves (particularly Lamb waves), generated and recorded with piezoelectric transducers, is also challenging in this type of material. Otherwise, traditional methods used for this task are subjected to physics-based knowledge of the problem, such as damage imaging algorithms like delay-and-sum and RAPID. This paper presents an entirely data-driven approach, based on the ability of Deep Learning (DL) techniques (particularly those based on Convolutional Neural Networks – CNNs –) to extract features of interest for damage imaging from a pre-dataset. In this work, the selected feature to be estimated is the normal distance from the propagation path of the guided wave to a simulated damage, which allows, in combination with an especially designed positioning algorithm, to locate with high accuracy defects, even in different positions than the used for the training of the network (a fixed grid of points over the analysis zone). This paper presents the application of the method to a real composite material specimen, as well as the recorded results obtained from additional datasets recorded with the simulated damage (a piece of blu-tack) attached to different random positions other than those of the training grid.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-030-67930-9_51-2,en,Simulation as a Transformative Pedagogy: Challenging Normativity and Embracing Emergence,ReviewPaper,"This chapter reimagines the field of simulation pedagogy, focusing on healthcare education to explore how simulation might transform learning and professional practices. Simulation plays a distinctive role in initial professional formation and ongoing professional and interprofessional education. We argue that the focus of much existing research on fidelity and an evaluative “what works” approach has led to a normative and prescriptive focus that perpetuates a conservative notion of simulation pedagogy. Our reimagination approaches simulation from a practice-based perspective. This foregrounds emergence, with learning characterized by temporal change, never fully decidable in advance, where context transforms learning and vice versa. Unpacking what such a stance might mean for the field of simulation pedagogy, we focus on (1) the learners doing the simulation and how knowledges, individual actions, and collaborative practices emerge; (2) bodies, challenging straightforward notions of the simulated body and drawing attention to the bodies of those enacting (and observing) the simulation; and (3) observers of simulation – who deserve as much pedagogic attention as the scenario being simulated. Through these the notion of emergence troubles the quest for control and certainty in simulation. Reimagining practices based on what cannot be prespecified in advance points to important but overlooked features of the pedagogic craft and demands of simulation. We conclude by framing prospects for the field based on a transformative agenda – replacing “as if” for “what if,” embracing the value of breaks from fidelity, and pushing toward practices that are less normative and more transformative for learners, educators, and professional practices themselves.","['Education', 'Education, general']"

In this paper, a bismuth film/carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotube modified glassy carbon electrode (Bi/CMWCNTs/GCE) electrochemical sensor had been used to establish a new method for detection of Cr(VI) in workplace air. Carboxylated multicycle carbon nanotubes (CMWCNTs) were modified onto glassy carbon electrode (GCE), and bismuth (Bi) film was precoated on the modified electrode by electrodeposition. The morphology and electrochemical properties of Bi/CMWCNTs modified electrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV), respectively. The results showed that the formation of stable bismuth films and sensor’s high sensitivity were due to CMWCNTs. The differential pulse stripping voltammetry (DPSV) response of Cr(VI) at Bi/CMWCNTs modified electrode outcomes with a low detection limit of 0.18 μg/L and wider linear 0.50 ~ 25.0 μg/L. In comparison to standard spectrophotometry, the newly designed electrochemical sensor had exhibited more sensitive, convenient, and environmentally friendly, which was satisfactory in analytical application to real air samples. Therefore, the Bi/CMWCNTs/GCE electrochemical sensor has the potential applications in the rapid detection of Cr(VI) in workplace air.

If monitoring is performed continuously and for a long time, it allows to evaluate variations in the building’s dynamic response to external factors. The main goal is to estimate the dynamic response of the monitored buildings to daily stresses produced by environmental and anthropogenic factors (variations in ambient temperature and humidity, wind velocity, vibrations produced by vehicular traffic or other anthropogenic noise sources including visitors, service staff, etc.) to distinguish ordinary fluctuations in the buildings’ response from other anomalous behavior. Continuous monitoring also makes it possible to assess the impact of extraordinary events such as extreme weather events, earthquakes, excavations, cultural events involving many people nearby the monitored buildings. Some examples from the authors’ many monitoring campaigns on monuments located in different urban environments are presented.

This is accompanied by an increased need for monitoring of adhesive bonds, especially for load-bearing, structural joints. In order to detect a possible failure at an early stage, this work is investigating a cost-effective sensor principle based on embedding of a polymer optical fiber (POF) into the adhesive layer. The strain and stress behavior of the adhesive bond are transferred to the POF and change its light-guiding properties. In the presented work, different light coupling conditions into the fiber (full excitation and angle-selective excitation) and different measurable quantities of the transmitted light decoupled from the fiber (photocurrent and far-field) are studied, to find an optimum sensor performance. The combination of a structural polyurethane adhesive with commercially available POF is investigated. The results show a high potential of the method for simple photocurrent measurement (transmission loss of 8% by half of maximum load) and an even more sensitive sensor effect for mode-dependent light power measurement.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The ADLs considered are: (i) preparing and drinking tea, and (ii) preparing and drinking coffee.Abnormal behaviour identified in the context of these activities can be an indicator of a progressive health problem or the occurrence of a hazardous incident. Monitoring ADLs for detecting abnormal behaviour is of particular importance due to the potential life changing consequences that could result from not acting timely. Prior to performing ADLs, the participants were asked six questions related to their well-being and mood. In addition to data collected from accelerometers, data was also collected from contact and thermal sensors, and radar. The work presented is a first step towards a more. personalised approach in which individual user profiles are considered as it is acknowledged that people behave differently from each other. Thus, data was collected seven times for each participant. We have evaluated our approach with accelerometer data collected from 15 participants. The experimental results show that accelerometer data is sufficient to identify the main stages of the ADLs considered, and therefore, any unusual changes in the signals and duration could mean that abnormal behaviour occurred.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The authors consider ventilation system structure and identify the causes of the high humidity—moisture in the water vapor form and a cold surface of ice which cools the surrounding space and objects. The consequences of this air state are fogging over the ice surface; condensate formation which worsens the quality of ice rink; corrosion of steel and iron structures; mold attack. In addition, the facility microclimate is uncomfortable for people to stay there. In the course of the study, the authors identified several ways to achieve the necessary indoor air parameters. The first method is sorption dehumidification. This system is able to function at low temperatures and to cope with extreme dampness, but it has significant costs. The second method, more simple and more effective, is assimilation. This method is based upon the ability of warm air masses to hold a larger amount of water vapor in comparison with the cold ones. This way of improving the air parameters is more effective when required to modify an already-existing ventilation system. In this particular case, in the ice arena in Sochi, assimilation was the most effective method. Air coolers with a drift eliminator were installed in the already-existing ventilation system. The calculation of the selected heat exchangers was carried out using the ventilation equipment selection software (VESS).","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

However, current treatment strategies are associated with several acute and long-term toxicities, including neurotoxicity. Further, racial and ethnic disparities persist in both incidence and outcomes for ALL. In particular, Latino children experience both the highest incidence of ALL and less favorable outcomes. The incidence of neurotoxicity during ALL therapy potentially jeopardizes treatment efficacy, and long-term neurocognitive impairment profoundly affects quality of life for survivors. Emerging evidence indicates that Latino patients may be particularly susceptible to these adverse side effects of therapy. Unfortunately, studies of neurotoxicity during ALL therapy have not included large populations of Latino children. Therefore, well-designed studies are needed to characterize neurotoxicity outcomes in Latino patients, while considering factors associated with disparities in cognitive performance in the general population, including socioeconomic status and acculturation. Ultimately, a better understanding of the various factors likely responsible for disparities in neurotoxicity is needed to improve outcomes for Latino children with ALL; these factors include inherited genetic variation, clinical characteristics, and sociocultural differences.","['Biomedicine', 'Cancer Research', 'Social Structure, Social Inequality', 'Public Health', 'Ethnicity, Class, Gender and Crime', 'Health Care Management', 'Latino Culture']"

Historically, adolescence is understood as a life stage in terms of its defining characteristics and features which gave it a sense of universalism and developmental predictability, largely drawn from a Euro-American lens. However, the discourse of the last three decades has questioned the universalistic approach by highlighting the role of culture, context, and diversity in determining the nature of adolescence. The key debates question whether adolescence is a biological or a sociocultural construct and whether there is a singular adolescence or several adolescences or in some cases, whether adolescence even exists. This chapter attempts to highlight and address these issues by building a kaleidoscopic image of adolescence as it is lived, experienced, and documented from an Asian Perspective. In the first section, research studies drawn from various regions in Asia examine issues related to universalism versus cultural relativity and consider questions of whether adolescence is a myth or a reality, an artifact of industrial societies, a stage marked by challenge and potential, and how it signals emerging adulthood. The second section discusses seven major developmental themes, including biological change, gender roles, self and identity, life-style choices, aspirations, media, and relationships, bringing out the nuanced specificities and generalizations across Asian regions and the world.

Assessing the actual and accurate 3D form and extent of interior defects is a complicated and also cumbersome task, unexpectedly with the developments in NDE techniques. Unlike the majority of traditional methods based on specialized forms of surface-penetrating waves or radiation imaging, this research uses optical cameras for full-field sensing of surface strains and deformations using the 3D-DIC technique as the basis for damage identification. This data-rich representation of behavior of the structural component is then leveraged in an inverse mechanical problem to reconstruct the underlying subsurface abnormalities. The inverse problem is solved through a topology optimization formulation that iteratively adjusts a fine-tuned FEM of the structure to infer abnormalities within the structure. Recently illustrated the feasibility of detecting and reconstructing the existence of 3D defects within small-scale structural components such as coupons using the proposed idea, this work focuses on expanding on the work by the authors to reveal that the proposed idea can be employed on large-scale structural components using the rich data from full-field image-based measurements to enable the identification of a more detailed picture of the internal defects. Thus, the goal of this research is to demonstrate the practicability and investigate the performance of the previously proposed method through an experimental program in which a set of large-scale structural components such as steel beams with and without buried defects are tested with full-field DIC sensing. A corresponding set of research steps with an increasing level of sophistication are designed to assess the capability of the approach to estimate steel material properties then to extent to infer the 3D shape of embedded defects. Upon completion, this research is expected to demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed subsurface structural component condition assessment technique and pave the way for its future implementation in existing structures.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

Varicocele repair (VR) can be either surgical (varicolectomy) or through angiographic embolization. Surgical repair of varicocele includes open non-microsurgical techniques whether inguinal (Ivanissevich) or high retroperitoneal ligation (Palomo), open microsurgical techniques (inguinal or sub-inguinal) or laparoscopic. The accumulating evidence suggests that VR can improve conventional sperm parameters (sperm concentration, motility, and morphology), seminal oxidative stress, sperm DNA fragmentation, and serum testosterone concentrations.

In terms of hull structure maintenance, the incorporation of Structural Health Monitoring techniques has emerged as a leading option. The objective of this work is to move towards this direction by investigating the use of classical detection theory tools to detect corrosion-induced thickness loss in ship hull structures through strain measurements obtained from in-situ sensors. This is introduced to regions where this phenomenon is common, and candidate sensor locations are selected based on the ship’s structural arrangement. Strain response data are obtained using a detailed FE model, which is subjected to a quasi-static loading condition, specifically still water loading. Operational variability is accounted for by considering the cargo filling rates as beta-distributed random variables. A Monte Carlo Simulation is utilized to estimate the statistical structure of the response, for both the intact and damaged conditions. Based on that, their distributions are considered mean-shifted and Gaussian. Additionally, the very low coefficient of variation of the monitored static strains allows for the measurements to be considered as deterministic signals. Therefore, the tools offered by classical detection theory of deterministic signals within noise are applicable and were ultimately used to construct a detector, whose performance was evaluated on an indicative 10% thickness loss scenario.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The investigated faults cause no obvious effects on the time domain signals, while their effects on the signals power spectral density are almost completely masked by the effects due to the different operating speeds, leading thus to a highly challenging detection problem. Two unsupervised STS methods are employed, the Functional Model Based Method (FMBM) and a Multiple Model (MM) based one, while a single accelerometer is used on a rotating machinery that consists of two electric motors coupled via a claw clutch. The methods’ detection performance is assessed based on hundreds of experiments with the healthy machinery as well as with two incipient faults. One corresponds to slight wear at the base of a single tooth in the claw clutch spider and a second to tightening torque reduction at one of the four machinery mounting bolts, while it operates under 21 distinct speeds.

Data was collected in a sequence of four waves of data collection to better understand how active travel changed from early lockdown orders through lifts in travel restrictions. Bicycling in all three panels showed examples of an increase in the mode share for commuting at the start of the pandemic along with less of a decrease in the absolute number of trips with this mode, compared to other modes. Through person-level change and changes in mode share, walking showed an increase for non-work travel and daily physical activity during the spring of 2020. The analyses presented in this chapter show how some respondents initially turned to active travel during the early pandemic months, but that active travel generally waned later into the pandemic.","['Engineering', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Urban Studies/Sociology', 'Public Policy', 'Cities, Countries, Regions', 'Epidemiology']"

COVID-19 has triggered high risks among human beings. For that, the infected humans working in manufacturing and logistics systems can lead to complex issues beyond the industrial networks. Smart logistics (SL) systems remain a promising area to form a safe working environment. SL promotes the use of automated assets based on networked sensors which are controlled by suitable intelligent decision-making algorithms. Using SL technologies smooths the release of the whole production process disruption, due to COVID-19, by interconnecting the good and service flows to decrease the severity of the actual industrial chain disruption. Our study presents a novel smart logistics framework to strengthen the production process recovery and build an evaluation model to assess the impacts of SL technologies. We form an optimization model, which allows the planning of SL resources allocation according to the market demands and regarding the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Vehicles act as moving force exciters and also represent moving additional masses. Studies of vehicle-bridge interaction suggest that complex behaviour can result from simple bridge structures interacting with small numbers of vehicles. Indirect SHM (iSHM), a paradigm in which vehicles are used as sensor carriers, introduces additional challenges regarding spatial and temporal data sparsity. However, as the bridge span and traffic volume increase, dynamic coupling between the bridge and each individual vehicle reduces, suggesting a possible optimum condition for iSHM in which available data quantity is increased and the influence of individual vehicle behaviour is reduced. This paper presents a study of bridge damage detection using data from moving vehicle responses, generated by Finite Element simulation. Varying traffic conditions are represented by statistical characterisation of force inputs and additional masses to the bridge deck. The effect of spatial-temporal availability of monitoring data on detectability of damage is investigated by synthesising the responses of a range of different combinations of sensor-carrying vehicles. The efficacy of vehicle-borne and bridge-mounted sensors for damage detection is compared.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

In particular, the paper aims to exploit PDs for SHM and damage characterization of the built environment, at the structural scale, in operational conditions (i.e., without input sources). The reasons behind this study rely on the possibility to use PDs to emulate very complex structural behaviors effortlessly, using PDs as a paradigm to build low fidelity structural models of real systems. In the present paper, new features to characterize the damage (i.e., to detect, locate, and quantify it) are proposed thanks to a special definition of the peridynamic theory written in discrete form. These features are the Bond Extremity Acceleration (BEA) and Bond Extremity Velocity (BEV) conjectures, which are obtained by discretizing a system with the Bond Based PDs and using a micro-viscoelastic constitutive law at the bond level. Moreover, the authors show how the proposed peridynamic parameters are theoretically estimable with very robust techniques already used in SHM, such as the Stochastic Subspace Identification (SSI) algorithms. The considerations reported in the paper are verified with numerical (virtual) models. The paper concludes that PDs can be used to easily parametrize the built environment opening new research possibilities on the use of PDs for civil SHM. Additionally, the proposed BEA proves to be a very scalable and general parameter to be monitored in real systems (providing information on the presence, the location, and the amount of damage), this also due to its physical based meaning and the straightforward method of extraction in operational conditions.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Structural Materials', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

Because of the aging of construction materials, lack of maintenance, exposure to amplified service loads or natural hazards, and the occurrence of structural pathologies, such as foundation settlements, ancient masonry structures often demand for retrofit interventions during their service conditions. Such interventions are aimed at restoring/improving their structural integrity for in-time preservation and to ensure a safe living of their occupants. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems can be effectively used as a source of knowledge of the structural performance of masonry buildings to optimize such structural interventions. Recently, new piezoresistive smart sensors, similar in appearance to the traditional clay bricks and therefore called “smart bricks”, were developed to achieve diffuse strain monitoring in masonry structures, thus facilitating the large-scale deployment of monitoring systems to such a building typology. This paper presents the recent advances achieved in smart brick technology, including the first field application of such smart sensors for monitoring strain in a full-scale masonry building prototype subjected to controlled damage. The production of smart bricks, their deployment within the masonry load-bearing structure, and the first results of the experimentation are presented.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Greater central adiposity and storage of fat in deeper or ectopic depots are potential contributing mechanisms. We collated existing and new data on the amount of subcutaneous (SAT), visceral (VAT) and liver fat in adults of South Asian and white European descent to provide a robust assessment of potential ethnic differences in these factors. Methods We performed a systematic review of the Embase and PubMed databases from inception to August 2021. Unpublished imaging data were also included. The weighted standardised mean difference (SMD) for each adiposity measure was estimated using random-effects models. The quality of the studies was assessed using the ROBINS-E tool for risk of bias and overall certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. The study was pre-registered with the OSF Registries ( https://osf.io/w5bf9 ). Results We summarised imaging data on SAT, VAT and liver fat from eight published and three previously unpublished datasets, including a total of 1156 South Asian and 2891 white European men, and 697 South Asian and 2271 white European women. Despite South Asian men having a mean BMI approximately 0.5–0.7 kg/m 2 lower than white European men (depending on the comparison), nine studies showed 0.34 SMD (95% CI 0.12, 0.55; I 2 =83%) more SAT and seven studies showed 0.56 SMD (95% CI 0.14, 0.98; I 2 =93%) more liver fat, but nine studies had similar VAT (−0.03 SMD; 95% CI −0.24, 0.19; I 2 =85%) compared with their white European counterparts. South Asian women had an approximately 0.9 kg/m 2 lower BMI but 0.31 SMD (95% CI 0.14, 0.48; I 2 =53%) more liver fat than their white European counterparts in five studies. Subcutaneous fat levels (0.03 SMD; 95% CI −0.17, 0.23; I 2 =72%) and VAT levels (0.04 SMD; 95% CI −0.16, 0.24; I 2 =71%) did not differ significantly between ethnic groups in eight studies of women. Conclusions/interpretation South Asian men and women appear to store more ectopic fat in the liver compared with their white European counterparts with similar BMI levels. Given the emerging understanding of the importance of liver fat in diabetes pathogenesis, these findings help explain the greater diabetes risks in South Asians.

This provided the Johnson government with a degree of autonomy and enabled it to abandon “herd immunity” and implement a dramatic policy U-turn and then, as the lockdown continued, resist pressure within the Conservative Party and from business lobbies to reopen swiftly. At the same time, however, the first phases of the crisis exposed the profound limits to central state capacity and the structural weaknesses of the British state apparatus. It could not prevent per capita mortality rates that were at that point far in excess of most other nations nor deliver on its many policy commitments. This in turn brought the devolved administrations and local government to the fore in ways that could not have been anticipated. Nonetheless, despite all of this, the early roll-out of a vaccine during early 2021 provided substantial political capital for the government that enabled it to mitigate much that had gone before, merged at times with Brexit discourses, and paved the way for UK politics to return to its pre-crisis developmental path.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Comparative Politics']"

It spans two neighboring countries, namely India and Bangladesh. In this article, we strive to assess the vegetation health of the Sundarbans region. We rely on the satellite images from Landsat 8 from January 2014 to January 2020. The vegetation health assessment is based on two indices, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and forest canopy density (FCD) analysis of the interest area. NDVI consists of two bands: red and infrared band, showing a negative trend of 0.0085 per year. The image difference technique is employed further to study the vegetation health of the area of interest. NDVI difference marks the coastal regions with a higher depletion rate of vegetation than the regions away from the sea coasts. The histogram of the NDVI difference shows a negative shift from the central zero axis, which is the zone of no change in the vegetation cover. Being an early model to study vegetation health, NDVI has some disadvantages. It tends to quickly saturates at high biomass content and blurs the difference between moderately high plant cover from very high plant cover. So, we have taken another model, FCD, to compare the results of NDVI with it. It highlights the sharp depletion of highly forested cover. Nearly, 80% of the highly forested region has been depleted and joins the medium forested area. The overall mangrove cover is likely to dip more in the ensuing decades if governments of the two countries do not take necessary measures.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics']"

Hence, this chapter applied the Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model (UTAUT), and Task-technology fit models (TTF) to determine how the pandemic and Gen X characteristics affect buying behaviors in the electronic marketplace. The primary research method was the quantitative approach, in which data was collected from 467 respondents through a structured questionnaire. The findings indicate that Gen X consumers’ mobile commerce buying intentions are influenced favorably by mobile shopping (m-shopping) efficiency, effort expectancy, and the perceived severity of COVID-19.

The designed technological demonstrator consists of a polyurethane elastomeric shell with a thin composite supporting core (glass reinforced fibers and epoxy matrix). Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors (FBGS) embedded within this core allow to detect blood pressure with the aim of adjusting the tightness of the bandage so that it does not block the blood flow of the patient. At each FBG sensor, the membrane has a protrusion (a “button”) which amplifies the pressure on the sensor applying a longitudinal deformation to the fiber itself. To achieve this effect, the optical fiber must also be supported by two rigid constraints at both sides of the FBG sensor by inserting the composite core provided by circular holes in correspondence with the elastomeric button (and therefore the sensor). This core provides the additional function of obtaining the membrane stiffness necessary to guarantee a mutual decoupling in the presence of several FBG sensors within the membrane. After having described the main steps of the technological process developed for the manufacturing of the device, the subsequent calibration and validation tests carried out are reported in the second part of this memory. In particular, the membrane was applied to the bandage of an arm to evaluate the ability of the device to monitor both the bandaging action of the leg, giving feedback to the health worker and the period of maintenance thereof to avoid incorrect bandages.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

This sudden spike has been due to many different factors such as development in sensor device technology and also the efforts to promote research that address the necessity for providing new ways for healthcare given the increasing challenges with an associated degree of an aging population. The processing and analysis of data is an important element of the research of such a system. The data generated from these healthcare devices are enormous and have the potential to ascertain well-being and to encourage effective management of health. In this work, a mechanism for the analysis of physiological sensor data from the healthcare devices, namely voting-based extreme learning machine, has been explored. The approach was also compared with the traditional extreme learning machine-based approach. Experimental results were very encouraging with respect to the performance accuracy as well as time taken by the voting-based extreme learning machine as compared to the traditional extreme learning machine to produce the output.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics']"

Therefore, long-term acoustic emission (AE) monitoring in the context of structural health monitoring (SHM) has been carried out during a dynamic three-point bending test to investigate the fatigue behavior of a prestressed reinforced concrete railroad switch sleeper. To detect microcracking during cyclic loading broadband AE sensors with a measurement frequency of up to 200 kHz were used which were especially developed for the detection of microcracks in concrete. For automatic three-dimensional location of the AE sources, a network with 16 of these AE sensors were attached to the surface of the specimen. In a period from Jan. 16 to Feb. 11, 2019, approximately 330,000 load cycles could be applied to a railroad switch sleeper. During the fatigue test the AE events were in real-time three-dimensionally located using longitudinal-wave (P) and transverse-wave (S) onsets. A total of 40,513 AE events were in real-time automatically located using at least 6 onsets. The results of AE monitoring show that the AE activity begins immediately after starting dynamic loading. Most of the located AE events identify macroscopic crack planes in the middle of the switch sleeper, where the load was applied. To the left- and right-hand side AE events indicate father macroscopic cracks, mainly in vertical direction. After accumulation of several microscopic cracks, the ultimate failure of the railroad switch sleeper took place.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Numerous investigators have focused on exploring various nonlinear sources, such as nonlinear material definition, different types of crack motion, de-boding, etc. In particular, the nonlinear crack motion continues to be very attractive to investigated due to lack of precise distinction about its impact on the generated higher-order harmonics and/or side harmonics. Furthermore, it was shown in the literature that this type of nonlinearity has the highest impact on the generated nonlinear wave components. Thus, in this paper, the nonlinear shear motion between the crack interfaces is taken into consideration. First, the analytical solution is prepared based on the Coulomb’s friction model, in which the low-frequency modulation of the normal force to cracks interface is assumed. Solution is obtained using the Harmonic Balance method. Next, the results are validated through the experimental investigation, confirming the choice of the model. Lastly, the analysis of the obtained side-bands amplitude components is performed to find characteristic features of the considered crack motion.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The “trait” perspective treats flourishing as a trait of the person that is reflected by forms of brain structure and/or patterns of neural functioning. The “behavioral” perspective emphasizes the brain as doing the behaviors that flourishing people do. I spend more time fleshing out the “belief” perspective, which is the brain’s representions of ‘having flourishing. In particular, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) forms these flourishing beliefs by generating positive evaluations of life circumstances (e.g., life satisfaction), the self (e.g., self-esteem), relationships (e.g., relationship satisfaction), and goal progress (e.g., purpose). This “belief” neuroscientific perspective on flourishing is parsimonious, helps explain the overlapping yet distinct features of hedonic and eudaimonic flourishing, and forms the basis for neurologically constrained psychological models of flourishing.","['Business and Management', 'Organization', 'Industrial and Organizational Psychology', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Philosophy, general', 'Neuropsychology']"

In the latter case, it will be possible to calibrate the most adequate and targeted interventions. In this work an application that allows to observe the structure functionality over time and to find possible damages is presented. In this case, the reference structure is a steel bar. Its monitoring is made possible using a microcontroller and two digital triaxial accelerometers.

Despite their widespread use in damage detection, few studies systematically investigate the efficacy of different waveforms in identifying variations in instantaneous frequency and damage detection. This article aims to address this gap in the literature. Wavelet properties, like center frequency and vanishing moment, are of importance for the wavelet selection process. For this, first, the moving load analysis was performed on the numerical model of the undamaged and damaged bridge with a low level of damage, and acceleration time histories were obtained at different observation points. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) using different wavelet functions including Symlets, Daubechies, Coiflets, Gaussian, were applied on the acceleration time histories. Then, the absolute difference of wavelet coefficients between damaged and undamaged acceleration signals were used in order to evaluate the success of each wavelet in damage detection. At the end, different resolutions were observed in high and low scales by using different vanishing moment, and by use of a wavelet coefficient line plot, Gaus2 showed the more sensitivity to detect the damage location compared to the others.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

However, the solution is compromised when the sensor network, due to logistic or cost constraints, is sparse and measureless finite elements are present. To overcome this issue the iFEM minimizes a weighted functional, assigning smaller weights to the elements missing experimental measures. Strain field pre-extrapolation techniques have been proposed to improve the iFEM performance, although still assigning arbitrarily small weights to the extrapolated strains. The current paper proposes a Gaussian Process as the pre-extrapolation technique for the strain field, which natively incorporates measurement uncertainty, therefore providing a metric to assign the functional weights, as well as confidence intervals for the displacement field computed through the iFEM. The proposed technique is validated with a virtual experiment; advantages and limitations of the proposed approach are also discussed.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The need for food increased at a quadratic rate, and even the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations estimated that food production would have to grow by 70% worldwide to meet the global food demand. Due to limited arable lands and countful availability of renewable resources, there is a need to increase the agricultural yield even more seriously. Agriculture is affected significantly by recent technological advancements in the domains of Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), and deep learning (DL). Researchers are helping farmers by applying these technologies to precisely automate crop cultivation methods, management, and production. This chapter provides the latest insights into the latest research initiatives that significantly impact smart agriculture and farming. It provides a detailed impact of IoT, machine learning, and data analytics that can be used for disease control; monitoring the climate; measuring soil temperature, nutrient value, and moisture levels; controlling and analyzing water consumption; and much more. These shall help follow scientific procedures for plant growth and increase crop yield. It refers to the latest work of researchers to provide solutions to various agricultural challenges, using several ways to automate and maximize agricultural produce.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Computer Communication Networks']"

The limited capacity of shelters to meet their needs is forcing many to turn to transit vehicles, bus stops, and transit stations for shelter. The pandemic only exacerbated the homelessness crisis. Fear of infection in shelters and reduced capacity due to physical distancing requirements drove more unhoused people to take shelter on the streets and also in transit settings. Although discussions in the popular media have raised awareness of homelessness in transit environments, the scale of the problem has not been well-documented in scholarly research. This chapter investigates the intersection of the pandemic, transit, and homelessness in U.S. cities, presenting the results of a survey of 115 transit operators on issues of homelessness on their systems, both before and during the coronavirus pandemic. We find that homelessness is broadly present across transit systems though mostly concentrated on larger transit systems and central hotspots, and it has worsened during the pandemic. The challenges of homelessness are deepening, and dedicated funding and staff are rare. Attempting to respond to the needs of homeless riders, some agencies have put forth innovative responses, including hubs of services, mobile outreach, discounted fares, and transportation to shelters.","['Engineering', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Urban Studies/Sociology', 'Public Policy', 'Cities, Countries, Regions', 'Epidemiology']"

Given the evolving role of CRS/HIPEC, we sought to characterize insurance approval and delays in patients undergoing these therapies. Patients and Methods A retrospective review was performed at a high-volume tertiary center of patients who received CRS/HIPEC from 2017 to 2021. Collected data included patient demographics, tumor histologic characteristics, insurance type, approval/denial history, and time to prior authorization approval. Descriptive statistics were performed. Results In total, 367 patients received CRS/HIPEC during the study period. They had a median age of 59 (IQR 49–67) years, 35% were male, and 76% were white. Of the patients requiring prior authorization, 14 of 104 (13%) patients were denied prior authorization and required appeal. Median time between authorization request and approval was 33 (IQR 28–36) days. These cases generated 410 insurance authorization requests, 94 (23%) of which were not initially approved and required appeal. The rate of upfront denial was 21.1% in patients with public insurance compared with 23.4% in patients with private insurance. Gastric cancer was the most common histology among denied cases (55%), followed by colorectal, appendiceal, and gynecologic malignancies. Conclusions Despite the broadening indications for and data supporting CRS/HIPEC, a significant proportion of patients still face hurdles in attaining insurance approval and coverage for these therapies. Addressing barriers to insurance approval is imperative to decrease therapeutic delay and improve access to data-driven care.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery']"

Recent resolutions by the Global Ministerial Conference on Road Safety called for a blanket 30 km/h speed limit in urban areas to address this problem. A project undertaken in Melbourne, Australia, set out to evaluate the effectiveness and benefits of a lower speed limit in a local residential area in the City of Yarra. The intervention comprised replacing 40 km/h speed limit signs in the treated area with 30 km/h signs with an adjacent untreated control area. A before and after study was employed with speed, resident surveys, and estimated safety benefits as measures of its success. Modest reductions in mean speed were observed in the after-phase of the study while benefits were impressive for vehicles travelling at higher speed levels where the risk of severe injury or death is greater. These findings represent an estimated 4% reduction in the risk of severe injury for pedestrians in the event of a collision. Questionnaire responses showed an increased degree of support for the 30 km/h speed limit in local streets in the trial area. The implication of these findings for road safety is discussed, along with the challenges and potential hurdles. Lower speed limits in local streets and municipalities is one important measure to help address vulnerable road users in residential local streets.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

Although problematic, electronic waste (e-waste) has been identified as secondary sources of valuable metallic and/or non-metallic materials over the years. Thus, finding innovative and ecologically sustainable methods and technologies to recover these valuable materials, particularly metals, from e-waste have piqued researchers’ interest as a means of supplementing the ever-increasing market demand for precious metals and rare earth elements. For leaching metals from their respective ores, biometallurgy is one of the most promising technologies in the metallurgical sector. Bioleaching of metals from e-waste, on the other hand, is still in its early phases. The performance of biometallurgy operations depends greatly on a comprehensive understanding of the microbial community during bioleaching. Omics technologies have opened new and exciting possibilities for discovering and probing complex microbial communities during bioleaching. Using Omics technologies and techniques in bioleaching can enable reliable predictions of how to keep microbial consortia active during the bioleaching process. Various Omics technologies essential to studying bioleaching microorganisms are addressed in this chapter. Omics technologies that have been leveraged towards bioprospecting for novel non-cultivable bioleaching bacteria and elucidate diverse metabolic pathways during bioleaching are also discussed.","['Chemistry', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general', 'Waste Management/Waste Technology', 'Green Chemistry']"

In recent years, studies have sought to propose milk proteins as natural carriers for bioactive compounds and develop nanostructures containing these compounds. Although most bioactive compounds have beneficial effects on health, some limitations such as low solubility in aqueous media, low stability to pH and temperature variations, and low bioavailability have hampered their use. We carried out a systematic review analyzing interaction mechanism studies and nanoencapsulation studies to analyze the progress of using milk proteins as carriers of bioactive compounds. To better understand the subject, a brief review of the characteristics of milk proteins and the techniques used in interaction mechanism studies were also included in this review. We initially discuss interaction mechanism studies involving milk proteins and β-carotene (BC), a bioactive compound chosen to be explored. These studies are essential because they report the different mechanisms of milk proteins in BC complexation. Thus, it made it possible to understand that hydrophobic forces were the main ones involved in the interaction mechanism between milk proteins and BC. Changes in pH and/or temperature can cause changes in the structure of proteins, which influence the complexation process. Finally, we analyzed the studies that formed nanostructures containing BC from milk proteins. Emulsification was the outstanding methodology in nanoencapsulation of BC by milk proteins. The use of polysaccharides and polyphenols improved the milk proteins’ performance in formingation and stabilizing nanostructures containing BC.","['Chemistry', 'Food Science', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general', 'Agriculture', 'Biotechnology']"

Many definitions of traceability can be found and defined by organizations and individuals with different perspectives based on different products’ supply chain. The global concern for food safety and quality and the need for traceability are being addressed by the development of legislation, new international standards, and industry guidelines. Quality and safety are both linked to traceability, whereas safety is implicated by traceability more often. They are two very important elements of people’s conceptions of food and associated decision-making (i.e., food choice). Traceability is primarily viewed as a tool for the food safety by providing means for recall as well as proof for authenticity of food, but it also related to food quality. Since both quality and safety were shown to be related to confidence, traceability may indeed boost consumer confidence through quality and safety assessments.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Operations Management', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-19467-2_4,en,Fishing and Overfishing-Sustainable Harvest of the Sea,OriginalPaper,"The impacts of industrial fishing have been present in the oceans for over one hundred years, but the exponential increase all over the world and the systematic exploitation of different areas started after world war II. The phenomenon of fishing has to be understood in order to understand the changes in the oceans, and such deep transformation is essential to capture the essence of the resilience: the collapse of fish stocks, the lack of biodiversity, and the profound transformation of ecosystems due to overfishing is in part responsible for the ocean’s impacted functioning that we witness today. It now seems that the collapse of many habitats is to blame for rising acidification or temperature, but the reality is that the impact of overfishing on pelagic and benthic systems is largely responsible for the profound transformations we see today. Trawling has devastated entire ecosystems, destroying the complexity of marine forests, both those that are dominated by vegetal organisms (macroalgae and phanerogams) and those dominated by animals (corals, gorgonians, sponges, etc.). It has been possible to verify that it is not only the destruction of the structures, but the compaction of the sediment and the continuous resuspension that made possible the impoverishment of the communities and therefore of the impoverishment of the fishing stocks. Beyond these impacts, pelagic fisheries have seen profound changes in populations, which evolve to the sound of fishing pressure. The minimum size of successful reproduction (i.e. the size in which the fish is lying eggs to promote the continuity of the populations), for example, has been drastically changed in many species, making possible for populations to survive despite the immense pressure of the predator, us. In addition, these fisheries highlight the fact that many animals are trapped with nets and long lines (dolphins, turtles, birds, etc.). The solutions to these problems are sometimes difficult to apply. These large organisms are usually essential for the health status of the ecosystem and the maintenance of the biodiversity, but we are impacting them in such a way that they have become irrelevant from an ecosystem functioning point of view. The so-called by-catch of smaller organisms is another huge problem. Discards (sometimes more than 50% of fisheries) profoundly harm and transform the ecosystem, and are difficult to sell in the fishing market. Solutions have been sought for decades and this collateral damage has been denounced, but there is still a long way to go. There is also a long way to go to eliminate the high percentage (calculated in more than a quarter of the fish landings of the entire planet) of those known as illegal, unreported and unregulated fisheries. This type of mismanagement of the sea is at the heart of the active policies of many countries, but without transparency and transnational actions, it will it will be difficult to reach a good agreement to suppress or minimize them. In fisheries models, apart from direct impacts, the effects of climate change have long been implemented. As already explained in the previous chapter, rising temperatures and the effects of acidification are transforming the landscape of primary and secondary productivity. The most obvious of these changes is the fact that there will be less fishing, and therefore less production. The effect of lower productivity is already felt in several long-lasting time series, where fishing is being affected by the decrease in phytoplankton. But, in addition, there are less obvious effects. One is the substitution of species, because some are more vulnerable than others to the increase in temperature, so that in the same taxonomic and functional group those who are best adapted to the new conditions win. Another is the expansion of invasive species that directly affect the food chain, and that may feel more comfortable with the new “rules” of fisheries impact and climate change. Some animals are already undergoing these changes, such as cetaceans dying of starvation in certain areas where the synergistic effects of fishing and climate change are felt. The co-governance of fisheries, in which scientists, politicians and society work together, is essential to move forward. They are not hollow words; they are real needs in a world of an excessively accelerated change.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"

In particular, heart sound analysis can provide a non-invasive, real-time, and convenient (anywhere and anytime) solution for preliminary diagnosis and/or long-term monitoring of patients who are suffering from cardiovascular diseases. Nevertheless, extracting excellent time-frequency features from the heart sound is not an easy task. On the one hand, heart sound belongs to audio signals, which may be suitable to be analysed by classic audio/speech techniques. On the other hand, this kind of sound generated by our human body should contain some characteristics of physiological signals. To this end, we propose a comprehensive investigation on time-frequency methods for analysing the heart sound, i.e., short-time Fourier transformation, wavelet transformation, Hilbert-Huang transformation, and Log-Mel transformation. The time-frequency representations will be automatically learnt via pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks. Experimental results show that all the investigated methods can reach a mean accuracy higher than 60.0%. Moreover, we find that wavelet transformation can beat other methods by reaching the highest mean accuracy of 75.1% in recognising normal or abnormal heart sounds.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Engineering Acoustics', 'Mathematics in Music', 'Music']"

Because this pandemic has hit various MSME sectors in Indonesia, especially the tourism sector, it is necessary to get more attention in order to get fast handling. Therefore, this study will discuss the impacts of COVID-19 MSMEs that operate in the tourism sector, what some tourist-heavy regions in Indonesia have been doing thus far to aid in overcoming them, and what the government can do to overcome these impacts. The purpose of this study is to help find solutions to these problems. Our research employs a qualitative research method with a descriptive type of research. The results of the research show that there are several impacts that the pandemic had on MSMEs in the tourism sector, including the lack of income generated because the source of income comes from tourist visits and a large drop in earnings and a large increase in MSME bankruptcy across the nation. Most of this occurred because the presence of COVID-19 prevents tourists from visiting. Each region has also enacted their own solutions, such as health protocols in Lampung and Kupang, and tourist-attracting marketing for Bali. The research also shows that the ministry of tourism has enacted several policies to countermeasure this issue, such as a change in how tourist-based businesses are run, safety protocols and certifications, and regulations. Our solution consists of contactless technological solutions as alternatives to travel and enactment of previously discussed government policies.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Statistics, general']"

Telescopic forks in composite material allow mass reduction while maintaining adequate stiffness, even if their use is currently limited only to a niche of applications, mainly for wear issues. Here, the fork tube was designed, optimizing the lamination sequence to replicate the stiffness of the original fork. The applied monitoring system uses optical fibers, for which composites are an excellent host material, with Bragg grating sensors. From the deformations measured is possible to derive information on the integrity, to set the performance of stiffness and to detect the loads. Given the difficulties in the correct positioning of the sensors (diametrically opposite on a cylindrical surface) and to imagine an effective use during racing, the need was highlighted to implement a system allowing a safe, easy, and precise positioning of the optical fiber on a predetermined path between the composite layers and the proper housing of the relative connector. The fork tube equipped with the smart veil was made by autoclave forming and then tested in the laboratory both alone and mounted on the bike. The result is a component whose deformations are known in real time, that integrates adequately protected and well-placed sensors, that are linked to the acquisition by means of a connector embedded directly into the structure itself.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Process Compensated Resonance Testing (PCRT) is an effective quality assessment tool that uses a broadband sinusoidal swept input to excite the resonant modes of the component and employs a supervised learning algorithm to interpret the resonant modes and as such to determine the structural quality of the component. Our previous work has mostly centered on the exploitation of classifiers that are based on Mahalanobis distance. However, in practice, the measurement uncertainty may lead to bias in the trained classifier, potentially resulting in misclassification of the turbine blade. In this study, the concept of interval Mahalanobis space is introduced in the classifier in order to cope with measurement uncertainty. The resulting Integrated Interval Mahalanobis Classification System (IIMCS) classifier employs BPSO to screen those resonant frequencies that contribute favorably to the system and analyzes the sensitivity of resonant frequencies to measurement uncertainty under a Monte Carlo simulation scheme.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the implementation of a perioperative care bundle reduced long-term mortality and the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) after MAES. Methods This study was a single-centre retrospective cohort study. Data in the intervention group were collected prospectively and compared with a historical cohort from the same centre. It includes adult patients undergoing MAES. We implemented a care bundle under the name Abdominal Surgery Acute Protocol (ASAP). We initiated fast-track initiatives and standardised optimised care in before, during and after surgery. Data were analysed using survival analysis and multiple regression. Results We included 120 patients in the intervention cohort and 258 in the historical cohort. The one-year mortality rate was 21.7% in the intervention cohort compared to 28.3% in the standard care cohort. Adjusted odds ratio of one-year mortality 0.81 (CI95% 0.41–1.56). The 30-day mortality was lowered from 19.0 to 6.7% ( p  = 0.003). The CCI in the intervention cohort was 8.7 (IQR 0–34) compared to 21 (IQR 0–36) in the control cohort ( p  = 0.932) The length of stay increased by two days ( p  = 0.021).

Most people infected with the virus experience severe impact in their health, finances, and many other aspects. Infected people often experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some become seriously ill and require timely medical intervention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. As the number of cases continues to rise, it is clear that these viruses pose a threat to public health. In this work, an analysis is performed on whether an individual has been affected with coronavirus or not. This is done via an online portal, where the user answers simple questions regarding the symptoms of the disease like cold, dry cough, loss of taste and smell, tiredness, etc. Once the given questions are answered, the user will be intimated whether he has been possibly infected with coronavirus or if the symptoms are not alarming. In case of possible infections, the application also shows the possible level of infection so that the user can take necessary precautions. The user could also take subsequent measures like visiting the nearby hospital immediately or having a remote consultation with a physician. This concept is made in form of website, where anyone can easily answer the questions and check the results. This method is quite feasible and an effective way of preliminary analysis that can done anywhere and anytime.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Computer Communication Networks', 'Computational Intelligence']"

In a statistical sense, this means that statistics and models derived and learned from data are insensitive to individual observations. Differential Privacy as defined by Cynthia Dwork in (Dwork 2006) has become a popular approach for ensuring privacy. In contrast to earlier definitions, Dwork defined differential privacy as a relative guarantee that nothing more could be learned from data whether an individual observation is included or excluded from the analysis. This was achieved by adding random noise that is bigger than the effect of a change due to the largest single participant. The approach was referred as 𝜖-differential privacy. Such an actionable definition gave more room for practitioners to define how, for example, machine learning algorithms can ensure differential privacy. In this paper, we present an umbrella review on differential privacy related studies based on a methodology proposed by Aromataris et al.

The work-life balance is also harmed as a result of the unhealthy lifestyle prevalent among construction professionals. The factors that contribute to the scarcity of construction personnel ready to work in their sector are investigated in this study. This study reveals several common factors affecting construction professionals’ lifestyles to improve their quality of life. The first step was to conduct a literature study to identify and summarize significant lifestyle influencing factors. Then, hypotheses were given on the impact of five different factors (financial, organizational, quality-health and environmental, work-related, and social) on construction professionals’ lifestyles. The information gathered from 180 construction professionals in Tamil Nadu and Kerala via questionnaires was statistically examined. The findings revealed that these five factors have a major impact on the lifestyle of construction professionals. The financial factor is the primary factor that influences the lifestyle of construction professionals by affecting their socio-economic position. This pioneering study presents a detailed overview of the current construction professional lifestyle and the essential factors that influence it. The association between each factor and the more relevant factors was discovered using statistical analysis, which will serve as a guide for researchers, policymakers, and construction professionals to conduct additional research and improve the current lifestyle. A healthier lifestyle will increase an employee’s productivity and, as a result, the company’s worth.","['Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences']"

Through critical reflection on systems of structural oppression, social work aims to resist oppression through transformative action and to work for sustainable improvements to wellbeing and justice for all. From an affirmative, creative, and hopeful stance, this chapter explores post-anthropocentrism and posthumanism as transformative paradigms for evolving contemporary social work. Before engaging with these paradigms, the modernist, anthropocentric foundations of conventional mainstream social work are considered in the context of persistent global inequities and injustices. A rationale for the transformation of social work is then articulated as the foundation for a reimagined future for the evolving profession, beyond the Anthropocene. Using relational ethics as a compass, key aspects of transformative social work are conceptualised drawing from post-anthropocentric and critical posthumanist theory. To close the chapter, some broader implications are explored including the possibilities as well as challenges for post-anthropocentric social work in the twenty-first century.","['Education', 'Education, general', 'Social Work', 'Social Work and Community Development', 'Ethics']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-07254-3_79,en,Monitoring Road Infrastructures with Self-sensing Asphalt Pavements,OriginalPaper,"Structural health monitoring (SHM) of road pavements is an essential task, which can help the decision-making process for timely maintenance actions. Embedded sensors are typically used to collect long-term monitoring data. However, the main drawbacks of intrusive sensors concern the risk of premature damage and the incompatibility of the sensors with the host material. Self-sensing asphalt mixtures can be used to overcome these limitations. These kinds of smart materials can autonomously monitor their strain and damage states without the need for embedded sensors. The sensing mechanism is based on the piezoresistive effect, consisting of a change in the electrical conductivity of the material when subjected to external loading. To endow the asphalt mixture with piezoresistive function, a proper amount of conductive additive should be incorporated without compromising the mechanical performance of the pavement. The present work aims to design piezoresistive asphalt mixtures for the development of SHM and traffic management systems. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) were added to the asphalt mixture with this purpose, and the piezoresistive response was tested at laboratory scale. The results show that piezoresistive asphalt mixtures have excellent self-sensing properties and can be effectively used for SHM, traffic detection and weigh-in-motion applications.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

A convenient approach employs shear horizontal ultrasonic guided waves that propagate circumferentially around the pipe, known as CSH waves. Typically, a pair of transducers, a transmitter and a receiver, can be used to interrogate the whole circumference. Conventional shear horizontal transducers generate waves that propagate in both directions, namely, clockwise and counterclockwise. Bidirectional generation complicates the interpretation of the received signal since the scattered waves from a potential defect can mix themselves or with one of the two direct waves generated by the transmitter. In this paper, we address how unidirectional generation can ease the signal interpretation task for circumferential guided wave testing utilizing finite element simulations. Unidirectional generation is based on dual periodic elements transducer driven by phased pulses, following a design previously presented. Generation and reception were performed with separate transducers on the outer surface of a 324 mm outer diameter, 6.25 mm wall thickness steel pipe. Corrosion-like defects were modelled on the inner surface. We show that, when the angular position of the defect approaches 180° from the transmitter, the defect echo can be almost completely masked by the wave generated in the opposite direction. Unidirectional generation of CSH waves proves itself to be an important feature in pipeline integrity monitoring, providing more reliable signal interpretation.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Numerous benefits are entitled to remote health control, care, and detection of critical cases. Even so, any downside to the protection of these devices against cyber-attacks could cause huge problems, such as exploitation of personal data, mistreatment, and even mortality. Medical devices save lives, but these devices also utilize these advancements to connect to the healthcare network as cellular technology continues its rapid growth. As a part of interconnectivity, due to security flaws with the hardware and applications used to manage patient information and run the system, networks face multiple security vulnerabilities. Security of medical equipment is a growing concern within the healthcare sector. An increasing number of medical instruments and services contain sensitive health-related information that needs to be protected in terms of accuracy, affordability, and secrecy. In the health care domain, managing protection, anonymity, welfare, and usefulness is a requirement in which body area networks (BANs) and IMDs have made it much easier to handle and treat a disease constantly and efficiently. This paper analyzes the limitations generated by technical and end-user demands and theoretical approaches to minimize wireless hazards. In terms of efficiency, mobility, and knowledge processing, the advantages of wireless medical services are incredible. By addressing vulnerabilities and reducing the expense of traumatic accidents, these advantages may be achieved. We also indicate some of the possible theoretical solutions as a countermeasure for security and privacy.","['Engineering', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Energy Systems']"

First, we present a brief discussion of the importance of employing appropriate theoretical frameworks that promote user engagement. Second, we discuss different theoretical perspectives on user engagement. Two theoretical frameworks, activity theory and the communicative ecological framework, are used to frame an understanding of users’ socio-cultural contexts and inform the design of a framework called Design Process Engagement Enhancement System (DECENT) to support designers in mHealth engagement designs. This paper addressed the research question of how to uncover the socio-cultural contexts of a user group to inform the design of engaging digital artifacts (tools) by augmenting two phases of user-centered methodology with users’ socio-cultural filtration and socio-cultural checklists for user engagement designs. The DECENT framework is an adapted user-centered design framework that uses activity theory and the communicative ecological framework as theoretical framework for understanding the socio-cultural complexity of users in the context of mHealth. The findings of the paper suggest that to fully explain and design for user engagement in mHealth, an integrated approach incorporating a variety of technological and socio-cultural factors should be required.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

But just as their emergence has brought about scientific, clinical, and ethical questions, the regulatory and legal implications of these products’ manufacture and use remain a source of great confusion to many patients, physicians, and industry professionals. During the last decade, the Food and Drug Administration has provided insights and guidance on when these biologics surpass the practice of medicine to become regulated drugs and under which circumstances physicians are considered as the manufacturers of cell and tissue products. With the exception of a narrow class of biologics, most of these products require FDA review and approval as drugs prior to marketing. Broadly speaking, only products that are derived from the patient or that do not contain viable cells are used in a homologous manner to their original function in the body and, while not being more than minimally manipulated, do not require prior regulatory clearance. However, ignorance has led to the exploitation of physicians and patients alike that use and receive, respectively, unapproved therapies lacking appropriate safety and efficacy data. In spite of great promise, the future of regenerative medicine may be at risk due to the inappropriate marketing by rogue clinicians and companies. This chapter examines the legal framework that federal statutes and the FDA have established to define these products and processes and their appropriate use and regulatory requirements prior to marketing.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Pain Medicine', 'Orthopedics', 'Anesthesiology']"

Humidity in the indoor environment can cause the growth of mold and the spread of bacteria, when in turn lead to health problems, such as respiratory diseases, asthma, allergies, fatigue, and headaches. Therefore, waste is effectively used as a building material for indoor humidity control. This will benefit the health of indoor occupants. In this study, discarded eggshells were selected as the research and development of indoor humidity control building materials, and were analyzed and compared with two natural humidity control coatings on the market. They were classified into three types as A-CO, B-SI and C-ES, and their humidity control capabilities are: (A) The moisture absorption capacity of A-CO is 74.77 g/m 2 , and the moisture release capacity is 72.48 g/m 2 . (B) The moisture absorption capacity of B-SI is 61.47 g/m 2 , and the moisture release capacity is 51.92 g/m 2 . (C) The moisture absorption capacity of C-ES is 100 g/m 2 , and the moisture release capacity is 91.8 g/m 2 . According to this result, the order of moisture absorption and dehumidification performance is C-ES > A-CO > B-SI; the overall performance ranking is C-ES > A-CO > B-SI. Through the equilibrium moisture content experiment of the developed building material (C-ES), we know that, on average, each 20 cm * 20 cm sample can absorb 4.05 g of water and release 3.66 g of water. This result can prove that discarded eggshells can be used as building materials for indoor humidity control, help reduce the amount of waste on the planet, and are environmentally friendly to the planet.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Arts', 'Building Construction and Design']"

Therefore, this chapter aims at providing (1) a state-of-the-art review of the literature concerning deep learning techniques for detecting distress in both pavements and buildings; (2) research advancements per asset/structure type; and (3) future recommendations in deep learning applications for distress detection. A critical analysis was conducted on 181 deep learning-based crack detection papers. A structured analysis was adopted to analyse major articles according to their focus of study, employed methods, findings, and limitations. The utilisation of deep learning to detect pavement cracks is advanced compared to assessing and evaluating buildings’ structural health. There is a need for studies that compare different CNN models to foster the development of an integrated solution that considers the data collection method. Further research is required to examine the setup, implementation, running costs, capturing data frequency, and deep learning tool. In conclusion, the future of applying deep learning algorithms instead of manual inspection for detecting distresses has shown promising results. The availability of previous research and the required improvements in the proposed computational tools and models (e.g., artificial intelligence, deep learning, etc.) are triggering researchers and practitioners to enhance the distresses’ inspection process and make better use of their limited resources. A critical and structured analysis of deep learning-based crack detection for pavement and buildings is conducted for the first time to enable novice researchers to highlight the knowledge gap in each article, as well as, building a knowledge base from the findings of other research to support developing future workable solutions.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Construction Management']"

The advancements in technology have generated a plethora of genomics data that can be utilized for the identification of diagnostic markers. Moreover, machine learning (ML) has created novel opportunities to significantly solve healthcare problems using bioinformatics techniques. In the last decade, nature-inspired intelligence (NII) has aided the development of machine learning tools for diagnosing antibacterial resistance gene patterns. The successful implementation of these algorithms, especially on complex and intricate problems, indicates their importance in artificial intelligence (AI). This review addresses the role of NII in combating infectious diseases using genomic data as well as the future perspective of its use in information processing, decision-making, and optimization for the diagnosis of AMR. The key problems in the practical application of NII using genomic markers and microbiological parameters are extensively discussed. This will aid in bridging the gap between theoretical researchers, medical practitioners, professionals, and engineers interested in the use of NII to solve AMR.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Health Informatics', 'Cancer Research', 'Genetics and Genomics', 'Bioinformatics']"

However, most require a separate console like the Wii or Xbox to play, and none offer the option of measuring vital signs such as heart rate in-game. Because of this, we developed an exergame that can be played using any computer with access to a python editor and a webcam and only needs an extra band containing a circuit with accelerometers and ARDUINO to work. Using the measurement of the player’s heart rate pre and post-game, we found that, on average, the heart rate increased by 43.2 bpm, making the game physically challenging enough to be considered an adequate form of exercise but not overly challenging to discourage the player from playing again. This game paves the way to make exergames more widely available to everyone, needing only a computer and webcam and thus increasing the average activity levels of the entire population.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering', 'Bioinformatics']"

However, a relatively large number of Vietnamese people usually avoid going to the hospital as they are afraid of long waits at such crowded places, while the current COVID-19 pandemic means being at those places poses a higher risk of contracting the disease. For simpler health problems, people would prefer a solution that, given their symptoms, provides a reliable diagnosis in a shorter time. This study presents an approach in building a deep-learning-based disease predictor of health conditions conducted from given symptoms in Vietnamese. The proposed method combines a tokenizer and bi-directional recurrent neural networks and achieved an accuracy of 98.96% (compared to a certified doctor’s diagnosis) in selected test cases, demonstrating its promising capabilities in the task. The application is expected to easily be integrated into a mobile application and open the way for other deep-learning-based solutions which analyze people’s symptoms to help them have their health conditions diagnosed at home.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Several studies have demonstrated effectiveness of vibration-based damage identification techniques (VBDITs) in detecting distress in bridges. In such techniques, damage is defined as undesirable changes in the structural dynamic response assessed by comparing its current damaged state to an undamaged reference state. Information from such a reference state may not be available at the time of assessing the current state. Therefore, a reference-free VBDIT has been developed which defines damage as unexpected dissimilarities in the dynamic response of the locations that are anticipated to respond to ambient excitations in a similar manner. To detect and quantify the damage-induced dissimilarities, the technique adopts discrete wavelet transform—a powerful signal decomposition tool—and combines it with spectral entropy through a relative analytical procedure. In this paper, the efficacy of the developed technique is experimentally evaluated through identification of load-induced damage in slab-on-precast concrete girder specimens. Following failure, each damaged specimen was intermittently excited by application of a low-frequency vertical cyclic load. A pair of accelerometers was used to measure vibration signals of the slab and the girder in the vicinity of their connection. The technique was successful in identifying the load-induced damage in the specimens. The results were verified by the test data obtained through extensive instrumentation and visual inspection of the damage. Utilization of this technique can expedite the decision-making process regarding the required repair and maintenance of in-service bridges.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

Decriminalisation has been identified as a key way to reduce exploitation Exploitation , minimise harm and improve working conditions for sex workers, but there has been little research explicitly focused on how far this happens in brothels in New Zealand. Moreover, there has been virtually no literature that looks at how such changes might occur; instead, the assumption is that decriminalisation Decriminalisation promotes the idea that brothels are governed as businesses like any other and that this will be beneficial. The question remains: Can decriminalisation influence the ways that brothels are managed in order to improve sex workers’ working conditions? In this chapter, I draw together the findings from the previous chapters to examine how sex workers are materially impacted by management practices. I argue that the emphasis on inclusion and legitimacy, whilst desirable and beneficial, can disproportionately benefit operators to the detriment of sex workers. As such, I conclude by suggesting better platforms than inclusion for sex workers’ rights and wellbeing are needed to ensure safeguards at work.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime and Society', 'Critical Criminology', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Gender Studies', 'Social Policy', 'Politics of the Welfare State']"

We applied the proposed model on a COVID-19 cohort from a large medical center in Chicago (with records from March 2020 to August 2021). We used the first occurrence of the Delta variant in the U.S., February 2021, as the threshold to divide the dataset into pre-Delta data (533 patients) and post-Delta data (56 patients). Our model demonstrated 0.82 AUC on the pre-Delta data and 0.87 AUC on the post-Delta data in 7-day predictions. Our contribution is a model that (i) explains relationships between different clinical features and provides interpretations for ICU admissions, (ii) outperforms existing methods for 7-day predictions, and (iii) maintains more robustness than existing models in predictions under the influence of the Delta variant. The proposed model could be used as a predictive tool in clinical practice to help clinicians in decision-making by predicting which patients will need ICU support in the future.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

However, dataset shift, i.e., data distribution of inference varies from the distribution of the training, is not uncommon for real biosignal-based applications. To improve the robustness, probabilistic models with uncertainty quantification are adapted to capture how reliable a prediction is. Yet, assessing the quality of the estimated uncertainty remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a framework to evaluate the capability of the estimated uncertainty in capturing different types of biosignal dataset shifts with various degrees. In particular, we use three classification tasks based on respiratory sounds and electrocardiography signals to benchmark five representative uncertainty quantification methods. Extensive experiments show that, although Ensemble and Bayesian models could provide relatively better uncertainty estimations under dataset shifts, all tested models fail to meet the promise in trustworthy prediction and model calibration. Our work serves as a benchmark evaluation for any future biosignal classifiers without requiring additional datasets.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Rare metabolic disease has also been reported in literatures and clinical research. Understanding the history and causes of the disease, associated symptoms, disease severity, physical and vital evaluations, etc. is recommended to provide or improve some appropriate therapeutic measure. The experience with patients starts with a critical and general presentation to a healthcare provider that may indicate potential conditions such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and metabolic diseases.

Taken literally, the tomorrow is a slight exaggeration but without water a human will not survive more than a few days and in the case of no food, a few weeks. In the pre-agricultural period of human history, the hunters-gathers foraged and hunted for water and food and, if unsuccessful, their chances of survival were severely, maybe even fatally, compromised. Humans also breath oxygenated air; about 20,000 or more times a day and the majority can only survive a very few minutes without it. However, even with sufficient air, water, and food in the absence of some form of shelter to protect against the vagaries of weather, animal predators, including other humans, survival was very difficult. Today, the same dismal situations occur when humans do not have access to clean drinking water, clean air, sufficient food, and adequate housing. These challenges have been exacerbated since the nineteenth century as global populations rapidly increase, a trend likely to continue to at least the end of the twenty-first century. Globally the world produces more food than it consumes, the amount of water has remained a constant since humans first appeared, anthropogenic activities continue to adversely effect air quality, and the housing supply is not keeping up with demand. Despite the global food and water situations there are still people without secure access to food or clean drinking water, which exacerbates the housing problems. Are these issues simply the ramifications of overwhelming population rise? Can they be solved? In a recent global survey, the respondents expected that as the world population increases engineers can resolve the water, food, and housing scarcities, although they also believe that engineering’s first priority is to solve these problems by 2035, as well as improving renewable energy and healthcare. These are challenging tasks long familiar to engineers, especially since political, cultural, geographical, and economic obstacles are invariably faced in their pursuit of providing societies with acceptable, sustainable, and affordable solutions. Moreover, access to water, food and housing is not only globally desirable, but also the member states of the United Nations have declared them to be universal human rights . In an attempt to ensure that global action is taken to satisfy these rights, specifically defined Sustainable Development Goals have been agreed by the same member states. Will these help or hinder engineering efforts to address societal expectations? In this chapter, the challenges faced, both in the past and present, by engineers with regard to improving drinking water quality, increasing food quantity and quality, and providing adequate housing are discussed along with some observations on how and why some of the present obstacles may be exacerbated in the future.","['Energy', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Environmental and Sustainability Education', 'Sustainable Development', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Natural Resource and Energy Economics']"

This approach was tested on a complex beam, made of two flat unidirectional carbon-epoxy tape skins and two C-shaped profile spars bonded together by a structural paste adhesive. Experiments consisted of making that test article undergo a 3-point bending by a dedicated tool, equipped with a linear actuator. In order to detect the debonding occurrences within the bonding line of the spar cap, optical fibres were integrated in the primary structure. Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR) was applied, implementing a 2 m long fibre optic having a spatial resolution of 2.6 mm and interrogating at a max sampling rate of 250 Hz, to monitor the spar bonding line. The results showed that the SHM algorithm provided reliable measurements for both position and size of the disbonding, and pose the right bases for further investigations on larger aeronautic scale.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Clinical solutions are being provided to patients in no time, which is made possible due to the latest improvements in the “Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and fog computing”. “Machine learning and Deep learning” are now being extensively used for various applications in healthcare such as extracting relations from vast amounts of patient data, analyzing patterns to predict the propagation of diseases, classify reports and X-rays to detect diseases, to name a few. In this paper, a deep learning-based model is proposed to monitor Covid-affected patients within hospitals. Our model can provide an online link between a patient and medical facility while also collecting patient data. This will enhance the care taken for patients. At the hospital end, we present a deep learning model using ResNet-50 that could classify chest X-rays as Covid positive or No Covid. Through this model we expect to quicken the process of COVID-19 detection while lowering the healthcare expenses.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Structures and Information Theory']"

Over the last decades, genome sequencing arose as an important ally to address such challenges. In bacterial infection, whole-genome-sequencing (WGS) supports tracking pathogenic alterations affecting the human microbiome. In viral infection, the analysis of the relevant sequence of nucleotides helps with determining historical variants of a virus and elucidates details about infection clusters and their distribution. Additionally, genome sequencing is now an important step in inoculation protocols, isolating target genes to design more robust immunisation assays. Ultimately, genetic engineering has empowered repurposing at scale, allowing long-lasting repeating clinical trials to be automated within a much shorter time-frame, by adjusting existing protocols. This is particularly important during sanitary emergencies as the ones caused by the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, the Zika virus rapid spread in both South and North America in 2015, followed by Asia in 2016, and the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2, which has infected more than 187 million people and caused more than 4 million deaths, worldwide, as per July 2021 statistics. In this scenery, this chapter presents a novel fully automated strategy to handle antigenic variability in immunisation protocols. The methodology comprises of two major steps (1) nanopore sequencing of infectious agent variants – the focus is on the SARS-CoV-2 and its variants; followed by (2) mRNA vector design for immunotherapy. This chapter presents the nanopore sequencing step and Chapter 17 introduces a protocol for mRNA vector design.","['Life Sciences', 'Biological Techniques', 'Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences/Technology']"

Medical and healthcare industries flourish with the help of vast data, and with the help of massive data, the advantages of accurate medical data analysis, early illness prediction, and accurate patient information may be securely held on and employed. Furthermore, the accuracy of the study may be harmed due to a variety of factors such as poor medical information and regional sickness features that might be used to anticipate outbreaks and so on. In this work, we will show how to use a machine learning algorithmic programme to correctly anticipate disease. To do so, we will collect hospital data from a specific location. We can utilize latent factor models to actualize unfinished information in the case of missing data. In prior work, a convolutional neural network-based unimodal sickness prediction (CNN-UDRP) algorithmic programme was used to forecast illness. The CNN-MDRP algorithmic programme, which is based on multimodal sickness prediction, solves the shortcomings of the CNN-UDRP algorithmic programme, which only works with structured data. This algorithmic application makes use of all of the hospital’s organized and unstructured data.

Prolotherapy is most commonly used for chronic musculoskeletal conditions, typically with tendinoses, ligamentous sprains, or articular cartilage damage, as in knee osteoarthritis. Furthermore, prolotherapy injections are commonly thought to be safe procedures with relatively few contraindications and thus pose to be a viable nonsurgical treatment option.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Pain Medicine', 'Orthopedics', 'Anesthesiology']"

The plight of women of color, who are Black, Asian, Hispanic, Native American or other minority groups, has often been ignored. These women are disproportionately stalled at the bottom of society—economically, socially, and politically. American law professors developed a unique approach towards feminism to more adequately encompass the situation, known as Critical Race Feminism (CRF). CRF seeks to identify legal problems, but also formulate relevant solutions as well. CRF originated out of a much broader set of legal and social movements—most notably Critical Legal Studies (CLS), Critical Race Theory (CRT), and feminist jurisprudence. CRF also introduces its own distinct analytical contributions. CRF contradicts the traditional feminist ideology of the “essential female voice,” and instead relies on the theory of intersectionality in which CRF demarginalizes the anti-essentialist plight of women of color. This chapter also discusses an approach to women’s rights on the global level, known as Global Critical Race Feminism (GCRF).","['Law', 'Theories of Law, Philosophy of Law, Legal History', 'Gender Studies']"

Therefore, according to Vision Zero, there are three main strategies to eliminate fatalities and severe injuries due to road crashes: protect people from exposure of harmful energy, reduce the risk of events with harmful energy, and protect people from harmful energy in the event of a collision. Controlling speed is therefore of the task of utmost importance in a strategy such as Vision Zero. A traffic enforcement camera, or “speed camera,” system has the possibility to control speed in a road system, and it has the possibility to affect its road users both at a macro and a micro perspective. In a micro perspective, it primarily concerns how effective the cameras are locally at the road sections where the enforcement is focused on, while at a macro perspective it is more focused on how the camera enforcement system and strategies, possibly together with the overall enforcement strategy, affects attitudes and norms related to driving with excessive speed. Experience worldwide has proven the effectiveness of automated speed cameras in reducing speed and, in turn, crashes and injuries. In this chapter, firstly the rationale behind speed limits, speed management, and speed compliance strategies will be explored and analyzed, in particular from a Vision Zero perspective. Secondly, various different approaches to speed camera systems in Europe, in Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, and France, will be analyzed and further explored. Finally, based on similarities and differences in approaches in these countries, in the last section some aspects concerning the setting of speed limits, speed management strategies that underpin the choice of camera technology, and modus of operandi, safety effects of and attitudes toward cameras, will be explored and discussed.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

Validation of Meteo-Marine Data and Implications for Maintenance,OriginalPaper,"Since 1988 onwards the VEGA-A platform, a steel jacket offshore structure operating in the Mediterranean sea near Siracusa in Sicily, is equipped by a monitoring system collecting environmental data (intensity and direction of wind, sea wave and sea direction) and structural response data (main frequencies and mode shapes). For these structures, in which the major part of the components is in the deep-water, analysis of the collected structural data and their cross-validation with the meteo-marine ones plays an important role in the maintenance schedules. In fact, a modification of the main frequencies and corresponding mode shapes over time may be related to a structural damage so, the capability to correlate structural and meteo-marine data allows a correct planning of the yearly maintenance operations. After a description of the monitoring system installed on the VEGA-A platform, this paper reports a statistical interpretation of the structural response over about 30 years of activity. The dynamic response of the platform under different sea conditions over these years is analyzed, focusing on the correlation between the dynamic parameters and the corresponding atmospheric and sea conditions.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Elevated blood glucose promotes anaerobic glycolysis which in turn produces excess advanced glycation end products, many of which have a pyrrole structure that can react with critical neuroproteins. Pyrroles also form between endogenous γ-diketones, notably 2,5-hexanedione, and the ε-amine group of lysine residues of proteins, including those required for axonal maintenance. The pyrrolated proteins undergo oxidation and cross-linkage, which interferes with axonal transport of materials from sites of neuronal synthesis to distal destinations. Thus, the distal ends of elongate sensory and motor axons are first affected, which triggers distal nerve fiber degeneration. Comparable pathological changes in long tracts of the spinal cord result in an overall picture of central-peripheral distal axonopathy. Whether, which, and what levels of pyrrolated serum/urinary proteins are useful biological markers of diabetic polyneuropathy is the principal subject of this chapter.","['Biomedicine', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Pharmacology/Toxicology']"

To prevent ergonomic injuries, appropriate ergonomic risk assessments must be used to detect ergonomic issues and change the ergonomics of workstations in the industry. The study’s importance arises from the lack of rapid, robust, and integrated systems for conducting ergonomic risk assessments. Thus, this study is aiming to design a Fuzzy Expert System (FES) to continuously evaluate the physical, environmental, and sensory ergonomic performance to minimize ergonomic risks, injuries and improve productivity. The DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control) methodology is used as a general structure to be integrated with the proposed FES. It supports identifying the standard ergonomic metrics and their practical tolerances, collection of relevant data from the industry, determination of linguistic scales, and fuzzy rules based on the collected data to determine the ergonomic performance of the industry. This proposed FES is expected to help the industry avoid the challenges of relying only on individuals’ subjective inputs while performing ergonomic assessments and eliminating miscommunications among teams in the decision-making process. Three important reasons to use FES in ergonomic performance evaluation are (1) rapid and accurate assessments based on knowledge database, (2) extraction of insights from the FES, (3) elimination of common psychological biases associated with ergonomic performance reviews. The developed system has been implemented in a modular construction industry and is expected to conduct a rapid ergonomic assessment to support an ergonomic intervention plan.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

While, previously, fetal undergrowth was not uncommon in these women, with improved maternal glycaemic control we now see an increased prevalence of fetal overgrowth. Besides short-term implications, offspring of women with type 1 diabetes are more likely to become obese and to develop diabetes and features of the metabolic syndrome. Here, we argue that the increase in birthweight is paradoxically related to improved glycaemic control in the pre- and periconceptional periods. Good glycaemic control reduces the prevalence of microangiopathy and improves placentation in early pregnancy, which may lead to unimpeded fetal nutrition. Even mild maternal hyperglycaemia may then later result in fetal overnutrition. This notion is supported by circumstantial evidence that lower HbA 1c levels as well as increases in markers of placental size and function in early pregnancy are associated with large-for-gestational age neonates. We also emphasise that neonates with normal birthweight can have excessive fat deposition. This may occur when poor placentation leads to initial fetal undergrowth, followed by fetal overnutrition due to maternal hyperglycaemia. Thus, the complex interaction of glucose levels during different periods of pregnancy ultimately determines the risk of adiposity, which can occur in fetuses with both normal and elevated birthweight. Prevention of fetal adiposity calls for revised goal setting to enable pregnant women to maintain blood glucose levels that are closer to normal. This could be supported by continuous glucose monitoring throughout pregnancy and appropriate maternal gestational weight gain. Future research should consider the measurement of adiposity in neonates. Graphical abstract ","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Internal Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Human Physiology']"

It is therefore an important topic for research in modern times. It should support mobility handling as well as patients’ movement equally as patient may move to different places at different times. Different cases are required to be considered to provide this service. A health monitoring framework should support all such movements and should ensure that proper connectivity is maintained even when the patient is moving in a car, and there may not be proper infrastructure along the road side for providing uninterrupted data connectivity. Ideally, a health monitoring framework should support such connectivity at all times. In our present work, we considered different types of patients’ mobility and worked on how to provide seamless connectivity using intelligent vehicular communication-based architecture. This work is motivated based on the concept of Internet of vehicles and vehicular movement. In this paper, we have designed a mobility handling protocol which will handle patients’ movement and provide seamless data connectivity at all times.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Materials Science, general']"

Such modeling technique starts by generating a synthetic population to set the units of analysis in the simulation. Some authors have used large synthetic populations of entire cities for different purposes such as solving transportation problems, conducting spatial analysis, and analyzing health care systems. However, generating synthetic populations is still a difficult task, especially for microsimulation models that evaluate COVID-19 spread. Therefore, this chapter proposes an algorithm that generates a synthetic population to evaluate COVID-19 spread in a microsimulation scenario. Each individual in the population is characterized by specific features, such as age, gender, comorbidities, work activities, and school activities. Moreover, the population of individuals is grouped into four clusters: home, work, school, and shopping. In each cluster, the social interaction is stablished using scale-free fully-connected networks. This proposal was validated using data on the second largest city in Colombia, i.e., Medellín, achieving quite promising results (which are close to actual microdata on the population of said city) and a total average error of 4.53%. Future studies could add some new clusters, such as transportation and geographic location.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

As such, it is often difficult to isolate which elements of the institutional environment may impact behaviour or general wellbeing, and whether those elements are working as intended. With an emphasis on U.S. prison systems, this chapter explores the most common challenges in conducting research—and establishing causality—on custodial architecture. Three key difficulties are explored: (1) operationalizing custodial design and its intended outcomes, (2) collecting comprehensive data, and (3) distinguishing the effects of the physical environment from other influences. The chapter then concludes with a discussion of several potential solutions that might allow future studies to surmount those challenges, including establishing a consistent definition of custodial design and its elements, the collection of more detailed custodial data, and methods for distinguishing the impact of design from other potential influences.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

To research bearing health state and remaining useful lifetime, several datasets have been developed. Among these datasets, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset is the most commonly used for bearing diagnosis. A large variety of approaches are applied on CWRU dataset and generating good even the tendency of perfect results. However, most of these approaches are based on supervised learning approaches and focus on classification of bearing faults. In this contribution, in difference to well-known existing approaches, an unsupervised approach combining autoencoder with k-mean is applied on the CWRU dataset. Firstly, the original data are segmented into proper parts. Segments in time domain are transformed to time-frequency domain by adjusting the window length and window function using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), and an associated spectrogram is generated. Spectrogram features are extracted using autoencoder and clustered using K-mean. Various metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. All metrics values demonstrate that this approach could distinguish CWRU bearing from fault-free state to faulty state. As a new result, the requirement of related training datasets of the other approach is – for fault detection – no longer necessary in the future.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

There was high correlation between proposed conditions and targets based on the bipartite analysis, which signifies that the people’s opinion has relevance in the priority ratings. To achieve SDGs, the implication of mining activities on the environment must be addressed. It was concluded that targets with high relevance in the three phases of mining should be given high consideration when establishing governance principles.

Due to the large number of bridges on typical networks and the limited availability of financial resources within asset agencies, decision-makers must prioritize certain structures when it comes to management in the event of flooding. In response to the notable challenges associated with scour detection, methods that can monitor the actual performance of a scoured bridge have become popular in recent years, especially dynamic Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). One such approach relies on monitoring changes in the natural frequency of a bridge structure due to the occurrence of scour, which represents a change in the structural boundary conditions and therefore results in a change in modal behavior. A further reduction of the uncertainty involved in the problem can be obtained by monitoring the scour depth. The decision to install a monitoring system on a bridge must be balanced by the financial benefit of doing so, as limited resources often need to be carefully rationed. The Value of Information (VoI) from Bayesian decision analysis can be used to compute the benefit of installing a permanent monitoring system (scour or structural monitoring system). The VoI can be defined as the expected reduction in management cost related to informed decision-making, that is when the decision is aided by the newly acquired information. A case study is presented whereby different monitoring systems are considered to be installed on a typical bridge to support emergency management during a flood. A comparison of the relevant benefits, accounting for multiple flood events and scenarios, is carried out to identify the optimal monitoring strategy.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Structural Materials', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

Existing shape sensing methods are influenced by the number and location of in-situ strain sensors used. A dense strain-sensor array can produce accurate displacement predictions, whereas a sparse strain-sensor distribution leads to inaccurate predictions and possibly a breakdown of the method. In the latter cases, introducing virtual strain sensors can provide additional input strain data for the shape sensing method. This paper provides experimental validation of this coupled shape-sensing approach, using real and virtual strain data, for the displacement reconstruction of a stiffened aluminium plate instrumented with fibre optic sensors. The inverse Finite Element Method (iFEM) is the shape sensing technique employed, and two strategies are compared for producing virtual strain data: the Smoothing Element Analysis (SEA), and modal expansion.

The impact of human reliability on performance of workers at offshore facility is higher compared to onshore facility, owing to the harsh offshore working environment. This study presents an integrated probability model that combines human and system reliabilities and utilises a Bayesian network (BN). A comparison was made between onshore and offshore facilities in terms of human reliability and probability of hydrocarbon release leading to fire and explosion in order to investigate the influence of human performance shaping factors (PSFs) of human error at each working environment. Particularly, this research uses probability values obtained from expert opinions in fire and explosion scenarios caused by hydrocarbon release in onshore and offshore facilities. The proposed integrated approach is applied to a case study on hydrocarbon storage tank at onshore and offshore facilities. Accordingly, three possible consequences were evaluated (i.e., probability of safe condition, hydrocarbon release and high pressure) that could lead to fire and explosion. The probabilities of consequences are compared between onshore and offshore working conditions. It has been observed that the probability of hydrocarbon release of at onshore is slightly higher compared to offshore working environment with a percentage difference of 0.032% and this can be neglected due to the small difference. Meanwhile, the influence of PSFs of human error are higher at offshore working condition. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a higher influence of human PSF of stress, task complexity, training, experience and atmospheric factor of human error at offshore compared to onshore due to the harsh working environment.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks', 'Energy Storage']"

However, health hazard of ammonia is large. This correlated with the large solubility in water.","['Chemistry', 'Green Chemistry', 'Energy Storage', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering', 'Energy Materials', 'Energy Systems', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management']"

Factors associated with receipt of LDT are poorly understood. Patients and Methods Patients > 65 years old diagnosed with CRCLM were identified within the Medicare Standard Analytic File (2013–2017). Patients with extrahepatic metastatic disease were excluded. Mixed-effects analyses were used to assess patient factors associated with the primary outcome of LDT, defined as hepatectomy, ablation, and/or hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC), as well as the secondary outcome of hepatectomy. Results Among 23,484 patients with isolated CRCLM, only 2004 (8.5%) received LDT, although resectability status could not be determined for the entire cohort. Among patients who received LDT, 61.7% underwent hepatectomy alone, 28.1% received ablation alone, 8.5% underwent hepatectomy and ablation, and 1.8% received HAIC either alone (0.8%) or in combination with hepatectomy and/or ablation (0.9%). Patient factors independently associated with lower odds of LDT included older age, female sex, Black race, greater comorbidity burden, higher social vulnerability index, primary rectal cancer, synchronous liver metastasis, and further distance from a high-volume liver surgery center ( p < 0.05). Results were similar for receipt of hepatectomy. Conclusions Despite the well-accepted role of LDT for CRCLM, only a small proportion of Medicare beneficiaries with CRCLM receive LDT. Increasing access to specialized centers with expertise in LDT, particularly for Black patients, female patients, and those with higher levels of social vulnerability or long travel distances, may improve outcomes for patients with CRCLM.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery']"

They may be able to convert CO 2 from the air into oxygen and remove it from the breaking cells of algae plants, which is how they produce wonderful oil. A viable source of feedstock for biofuels, oleaginous microalgae have a number of advantages over terrestrial plants. Due to the lack of robust algal strains with increased lipid content and biomass and methodologies for economically viable oil extraction, the microalgal fuel business is still in its infancy. By carefully targeting important metabolic nodes, microalgal metabolic engineering demonstrates the huge potential to improve lipid accumulation without compromising cell growth. The genetic enhancement of microalgae without impairing cellular biomass remains an underutilized option for large-scale biofuel production, despite recent advances in synthetic biology. To improve microalgae as a biofuel platform for the production of biohydrogen, alcohols generated from starch, substitutes for diesel fuel, and/or alkanes, we consequently present a thorough overview of numerous biotechnological techniques in this chapter.","['Life Sciences', 'Microbiology', 'Biological Techniques', 'Biotechnology']"

Meanwhile, an ever-increasing volume of traffic each year, both in number and weight of vehicles, is creating an additional critical situation for this kind of structure. To predict the response of bridges to traffic loads and their ultimate capacity with low uncertainties, we can use numerical structural models; however, such uncertainties increase as bridges age due to deterioration mechanisms. Non-destructive tests of material specimens and full-scale on-site load tests of the structure allow to update model parameters and have a better estimate of the bridge behaviour. However, different load tests provide different information with different impacts on the updated model accuracy. With the aid of a real-life case study, the Alveo Vecchio highway bridge, which has been tested to failure with a sequence of progressively increasing load, we aim to understand what behaviour can predict a structural model and what we can learn from a load test. This study is part of a research agreement between the Italian Ministry of Sustainable Infrastructure and Mobility, Autostrade per l’Italia SpA (the main operator of Italian highways), and the University of Trento. It concerns the management and monitoring of civil infrastructure intending to develop survey protocols and monitor systems to assess the safety and performance of existing highway bridges.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The World Health Organization 2017 and 2019 classifications further subdivided G3 NENs into G3 neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). Current guidelines favor medical management in most of these patients, and the role of surgical management is not well defined. We performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of surgical management versus nonsurgical management for G3 GEP NENs. Materials and Methods A PRISMA-compliant systematic review of the MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases (end-of-search date: 16 July 2021) was conducted. Individual patient survival data were reconstructed, and random-effects meta-analyses were performed. Results Fourteen studies comprising 1810 surgical and 910 nonsurgical patients were systematically reviewed. Publication bias adjusted meta-analysis of 12 studies (1788 surgical and 857 nonsurgical patients) showed increased overall survival (OS) after surgical compared with nonsurgical management for G3 GEP NENs [hazard ratio (HR) 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31–0.53]. Subgroup meta-analyses showed increased OS after surgical management for both pancreatic and gastrointestinal primary sites separately. In another subgroup meta-analysis of G3 GEP NETs (not NECs), surgical management was associated with increased OS compared with nonsurgical management (HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11–0.61). Conclusions Surgical management of G3 GEP NENs may provide a potential survival benefit in well-selected cases. Further research is needed to define which patients will benefit most from surgical versus nonsurgical management. The current literature is limited by inconsistent reporting of survival outcomes in surgical versus nonsurgical groups, tumor grade, differentiation, primary tumor site, and selection criteria for surgical and nonsurgical management.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery']"

We consider the psychological safety of students with health limitations and disabilities as a special state of mind, characterized by adequate perception and assessment of the degree of danger of the educational environment of the university, formed in the process of conscious self-image as a future professional, the accumulation of experience in overcoming problematic situations of professionalization. Resilience is singled out as the most significant factor in the development of psychological safety. It is analyzed as the ability to survive important stages of obtaining higher professional education without violating the main indicators of the disease, while maintaining internal mental and social balance and signs of working capacity.. The dynamics of the development of these indicators at the mental and psychological levels allows us to draw a conclusion about the logic of the formation of resilience, which ensures the formation of the psychological safety of students with health limitations and disabilities. The basis for the formation of resilience is the indicators of control, most pronounced among first-year students, and its integral component is the indicator of risk acceptance, recorded among graduates.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

Nanoparticles exhibit great advantages since they can reduce formaldehyde emissions through (i) indirectly increasing the curing degree of the resins, thus resulting improved hydrolytic stability due to the increased chemical bonds of the resin components with free formaldehyde, (ii) reaction of hydroxyl groups that occur on the nanomaterial surface with free formaldehyde, and (iii) barrier properties or “shielding effect.” According to the current literature, the compounds that have been investigated in the form of nanoparticles are silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide, halloysite, aluminum oxide, zinc oxide, clay minerals (bentonite, montmorillonite), and nanocellulose carbon nanotubes. Each of the tested material has a different reaction in relation to its loading level, interaction with the resin matrix as well as its efficiency. In any case, it was concluded that nanofillers can only be used in relatively small amounts because excess nanoparticle quantities induce aggregation within the adhesive structure and subsequent deterioration of the adhesive bonds. In many cases, the loading levels should probably be finely adjusted to avoid adverse effects. Alternatively, finding new ways to improve dispersion could also be useful.","['Life Sciences', 'Forestry', 'Nanotechnology', 'Plant Sciences', 'Biotechnology', 'Anatomy', 'Genetics and Genomics']"

It is therefore essential to find novel mechanisms and targets that could be utilized in potential treatment strategies and, as such, intracellular membrane trafficking has re-emerged as a regulatory tool for controlling metabolic homeostasis. Membrane trafficking is an essential physiological process that is responsible for the sorting and distribution of signalling receptors, membrane transporters and hormones or other ligands between different intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane. Dysregulation of intracellular transport is associated with many human diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, immune deficiencies and metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and its associated complications. This Review focuses on the latest advances on the role of endosomal membrane trafficking in metabolic physiology and pathology in vivo, highlighting the importance of this research field in targeting metabolic diseases. Membrane trafficking is essential for the sorting and distribution of several different types of cargo between different intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane. In this Review, advances in understanding the contribution of the endosomal system to metabolic physiology and pathology are outlined. The endosomal system controls signalling involved in metabolic physiology by tuning the trafficking and distribution of key proteins. Some of the core machineries involved in the endosomal system are altered in metabolic diseases. Tuning the endosomal system could improve metabolic parameters in metabolic diseases. Altering receptor trafficking through ligand-biased agonism is a potential novel therapeutic strategy for metabolic pathologies.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Endocrinology']"

In the early 1990s road deaths soared to a staggering 8000 a year. A diagnosis found that Poland’s lack of systemic road safety action was to blame for those figures. In response, the state set up road safety bodies and commissioned road safety programs. In 2005, Poland followed the example of Sweden and adopted Vision Zero as a far-reaching concept of changes in road safety. The work that followed helped to improve the situation and reach less than 3000 fatalities in 2015. Despite that, for years Poland has been notorious for its road accident deaths, which are some of the highest in the EU. Poland has had its share of both successes and failures. The results of road safety policies are still below the expectations and many problems have not been solved. Road accidents are not considered a major problem. As a consequence, they are low on political agendas and the institutions remain ineffective due to a sense of collective responsibility for road safety problems. Achieving Vision Zero will require many changes, learning from past mistakes, taking advantage of the experience of the best performing countries, and, above all, taking effective and efficient actions with their systematic monitoring. This chapter is a summary of the last 30 years of road safety work in Poland. It presents a diagnosis of Poland’s problems, an assessment of the policies so far, and the likelihood of achieving the assumptions of Vision Zero in the future. Building on this, recommendations are given on the next steps Poland should take to improve its road safety.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

The number of bridges in the operational services period is 140. Maintenance is necessary to maintain the durability of bridges and to ensure any low condition can return to the durable condition as per requirements. However, before maintenance inspection and monitoring should be done to avoid accidents or collapses, such was the case with Kutai Kartanegara (Kukar) bridge in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Currently, monitoring of Special Bridges is still lacking, especially for bridges far from city centers. Moreover, monitoring is usually done by visual inspection of the bridges’ condition and thus unable to determine whether the structures are still safe according to their planning age. In recent years, there have been several Special Bridges with SHMS, such as the Soekarno bridge, Merah Putih bridge, etc. Unfortunately, on those bridges, the local SHMS is not functioning well, likewise with the integrated central SHMS. Therefore, there is a need to conduct, first, parameter or component analysis that is necessary for the development of integrated SHMS, and second, development of the integration and management of local and central SHMS. With the working system, the bridges’ condition can be monitored in real-time and can become the basis for decision making by stakeholders to conduct maintenance or repair when there are damages or accidents or any force majeure and unforeseen conditions.","['Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences']"

This proved the central—and thorny—question with which so many of the authors grappled. Its simplicity is deceiving. Yet centring this foundational concern caused many of us to return to basic questions about the nature, purpose, and outcomes of punishment. As a result, the Handbook is a testament to what can be achieved if we discard historical blueprints and abandon old ideas about what prisons are supposed to look like in favour of a more imaginative and humane response to people in prison—a consideration of what these facilities  should look like. The question of ‘what works’ is not a bad one because it forces us to think about all the well-meaning (and not so well-meaning) architectural experiments that have been tried over the last two centuries, and the pros and cons of different configurations of carceral space.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

Plant disease epidemics historically played a significant role in the starvation and displacement of the world population. Despite huge progress made by researchers in managing diseases of staple commodities, the threat level remains very high, as disease-causing organisms adapt to new hosts, become more virulent by changing their genetic makeup, and show increased resistance against fungicide products. The history of blast disease, which affects one of the world’s staple foods, rice, goes back centuries and has been a continual problem for rice production worldwide with the recent inclusion of wheat blast. Extensive studies on the biology, pathogenicity, and population genetics of Maganaporthe oryzae (Synonym: Pyricularia oryzae ), the causal agent of blast disease, have enriched our understanding of the potential threat that this pathogen poses to rice and wheat production, and therefore world food security. Based on host specificity, mating ability, and genetic relatedness, M. oryzae is divided into several subgroups or pathotypes (different crop-adapted lineages). The genome structure of M. oryzae , characterized by instability, parasexual recombination, and the presence of transposon elements, enabling this pathogen to evolve rapidly and jump from one host to another, has raised real concerns for scientists, growers, and food policy makers. All available options such as forecasting and mapping of disease and pathogen race distribution, early and reliable quick diagnostics, biological and chemical control measures, inclusion of cultivars with resistance genes, and development of blast-resistant variety using CRISPR-Cas genome editing should be considered and deployed as a package for successful control of M. oryzae .","['Life Sciences', 'Microbiology', 'Plant Pathology', 'Microbial Genetics and Genomics', 'Plant Physiology', 'Mycology', 'Plant Sciences']"

In the last five years, several independent studies have used Ecological Momentary Assessment to assess tinnitus. With this chapter, we want to review the current state of this research. All the EMA studies revealed a considerable variability of tinnitus loudness and tinnitus distress. It has been found that emotional states and emotional dynamics, the subjectively perceived stress level and the time of the day exert influence on the tinnitus variability. In summary, the EMA method revealed a good potential to improve our scientific understanding of tinnitus. Furthermore, it also showed that it can be used to understand the individual differences of tinnitus—and may even be used as a tool for individualized diagnostic and treatment.

We have found the difference between state-owned and privately-owned organisations in the perception of “telework benefits” and between different industries for the perception of “telework problems”, and both variables show different perceptions in groups with different educational support. We propose a model of the telework aversion with the factors of leaving home preference, telework anxiousness, and provided education and support by the organisation for the telework. The main limitation of our research comes from the sample size and structure. While all the model’s factors are significant, our model’s predictive power is very low, which calls for future research. Expanding regional scope and analysis on larger sample sizes can provide comparison and a basis for more advanced models predicting telework aversion.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business and Management, general', 'Data Engineering']"

A large number of solid waste treatment options are available for decision-makers to choose from however the selection of an appropriate solid waste treatment method for a particular area is a challenging task as it requires trade-off between a pool of economic, environmental, social, and technical criteria. In recent decades, Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) has emerged as a convenient tool to address such challenging decision-making problems. This paper highlights the application of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a multi-criteria decision-making technique, in the selection of the most suitable solid waste treatment method in the context of rural areas. Three alternatives viz. Anaerobic Digestion, Vermicomposting, and Windrow Composting are evaluated against 10 criteria to obtain the priorities of the alternatives. In AHP, the final priorities of alternatives can be synthesized in two different modes: Distributive mode and Ideal mode. In this paper also, both the modes have been used and their results are compared. In both the modes, Anaerobic Digestion emerged as the most appropriate solid waste treatment method for the selected study area. To check the robustness of the results obtained, a sensitivity analysis has also been performed by adopting a scenario-based approach.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes']"

As an example, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) could be useful in giving a precise and complete mapping of damage distribution in a structure, including low-intensity or localized defects, which could be difficult to detect via traditional testing techniques. In this domain, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are employed in this work along with one-dimensional refined models based on the Carrera Unified formulation (CUF) for surface strain/displacement based damage detection in composite laminates. A layer-wise kinematic is adopted, while an isotropic damage formulation is implemented. In detail, CUF-based finite element models have been exploited in combination with Monte Carlo simulations for the creation of a dataset of damage scenarios used for the training of the CNN. Therefore, the latter is fed with images of the strain or displacement field in a region of particular interest for each sample, which are subjected to the same boundary conditions. The trained CNN, given the strain/displacement mapping of an unknown structure, is therefore able to detect and classify all the damages within the structure, solving the so-called inverse problem.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

The aim of this study was to assess burnout among master’s degree nursing students and to evaluate its possible relationship with a compromising negotiation style. A descriptive comparative study was conducted. Nurses’ personal, academic, and professional data were collected. Burnout was measured using the Italian version of the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory, with its two dimensions of disengagement and exhaustion. Negotiation skills were assessed through a Serious Game based on Rahim and Bonoma’s theory of conflict management that included daily life five scenarios. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed in a sample of 33 students. The results showed a mean disengagement level of 3.2 (SD 0.6) points and an exhaustion level of 2.8 (SD 0.7) points. In three serious game scenarios, students who did not use a compromising negotiation style had significantly higher disengagement levels than those who did (Sports, p  = 0.019; Motorbike, p  = 0.008; CD Store, p  < 0.001). The students seemed to appreciate the engagement in the study and the game used. This is the first study to assess burnout together with negotiation styles identified through a Serious Game. The findings suggest that implementing alternative training strategies, combined with traditional teaching could support students in better integrating theoretical and practical knowledge and engaging in active learning.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This article develops an accurate and computationally efficient time-domain spectral finite element (SFE) for wave propagation analysis of laminated composite and sandwich beam and panel-type structures based on the efficient layerwise zigzag theory. It considers the axial displacement to follow a global third-order variation with a layerwise linear variation across the thickness. The independent variables are reduced to only three by imposing the interfacial continuity of transverse shear stress and shear traction-free conditions at the top and bottom surfaces. Regardless of the number of layers in the laminate, the element has only four degrees of freedom (DOFs) per node $$u_0$$ u 0 , $$w_0$$ w 0 , $$\frac{dw_0}{dx}$$ d w 0 dx , and $$\psi _0$$ ψ 0 .

In India, agrarian distress has been manifested in the form of farmers’ suicide for the past 20 years. Agrarian distress in the farm household is resulting in deteriorated living standards, challenges in getting a quality education, forced migration, unmanageable health expenses, and poor nutrition level. In this regard, financial analysis is an effective method to identify the severity of the agrarian distress in the farm households (FHH). In this study, a financial analysis of 150 FHHs from Yavatmal district (being India’s most agrarian distressed area) has been conducted for three consecutive years from 2016–17, 2017–18, and 2018–19. After preparing financial statements and computing financial performance measures, FHHs have been categorized into five groups (i) FHHs not earning profit from the farm, (ii) FHHs not able to save money at the end of the year, (iii) FHHs putting their asset in risk, (iv) FHHs not able to repay the loan, and (v) FHHs not able to earn sufficient from farm to fulfill their HH expenditure. It has been observed that 22%, 16%, and 14% of the sampled FHHs, respectively in the year 2016–17, 2017–18, and 2018–19 earned sufficient from their farm to fulfill their domestic expenditure (category v).

We compared phytoplankton assemblages in the Lower Columbia River Estuary (LCRE) during two Pacific MHWs that took place in 2015 and 2019, with observations from 2017, a year with no MHW. These data were paired with environmental data from the summers of 2015–2019 to characterize differences in estuarine conditions during MHWs that promote phytoplankton assemblage transitions and identify HAB-conducive conditions. Bloom densities of HAB taxa, Pseudo-nitzschia spp. (4.16 × 10 6 cells L −1 ) and Gymnodinium catenatum (5.66 × 10 6 cells L −1 ), were noted in the estuary during 2015 and 2019, respectively, 2 years where Pacific MHWs occurred during the summer months. These blooms coincided with estuary temperatures that were 1–2 ℃ above and river discharge volumes 46–48% lower than decadal daily averages. We identified patterns in the densities of several algal taxa associated with MHW-mediated low discharge in the LCRE, such as declines in tychopelagic diatoms and increasing abundance of pelagic marine taxa. We conclude that low river discharge, through extension of saline habitat area and longer residence times, likely contributed to the development of the observed marine HABs in the estuary. MHWs and associated declines in discharge are projected to become more common in the Pacific Northwest with climate change, which may alter late summer phytoplankton assemblages in the LCRE.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Freshwater & Marine Ecology', 'Environmental Management', 'Coastal Sciences', 'Water and Health']"

However, most engineering structures have geometries for which such a straightforward damage detection approach is not feasible. This paper introduces the Aligned Marker Space (AMS) method to close this gap and allow using straightforward deflection-difference-based damage detection methods for various civil engineering structures. The method involves transforming vision data into a new morphed space to straighten complex geometries along one dimension. Data transformed using this approach can be used as an input to various damage detection algorithms, including local (e.g., second-derivative-based or wavelet-based algorithms) and global approaches (e.g., trend detection and line-segments method). The method is verified based on data acquired in numerical simulations and in a set of practical experiments. A Blender-based approach is used to build plausible simulated data with a high resemblance to real-life examples. These examples are then validated using complex geometries in a series of physical experiments under laboratory conditions.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

This chapter focuses on how mobile devices, social media, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of AI-infused information technologies can meet the communication and information needs of crisis managers. In examining research on mobile phones, the chapter reveals the pivotal role they play in helping people participate in more conversations that can increase their chances for receiving help and for providing early alerts. But during disasters, power goes out and Internet connections can be lost, revealing fragile infrastructure and inequities, and underpinning current disaster communication. Mobile phones also provide a primary avenue to access social media, an important communication channel for people to share their calls for help. The chapter discusses the vast quantity of data generated by social media and how scholars are using textual, visual, geo-referenced, and network data to train machines to provide meaningful situation awareness for crisis managers. As AI-infused information technologies are being developed, often by incorporating human expertise, they are making progress toward being an integral partner in disaster response and recovery. The future of research on using ICTs to bridge some of the existing gaps includes considering additional methods, expanding to consider cultural variables, and including disaster practitioners on even broader interdisciplinary research teams.","['Business and Management', 'Sustainability Management', 'Social Policy', 'Natural Hazards', 'Climate Change Management and Policy', 'Environmental Law/Policy/Ecojustice']"

Recently, COVID-19 pandemic has brought a huge crisis on construction sector. During this crisis, risk management becomes even more crucial to avoid further losses in the project. This study aims at identifying the risks involved in construction project during COVID-19 crisis, analyse them and develop a plan to bring the project back on schedule. Possible risks involved in construction sector due to COVID-19 are identified and defined. The risks are classified based on the categories like commercial risk, health and safety risk, completion risk etc. The project was analysed for all categories of risks using Expected Value Method (EVM) for statistical analysis. EVM evaluates the average outcome when the future events may or may not happen. Based on the analysis, Composite Likelihood factor, Composite Impact factor and risk severity has been computed. The EVM results shown that the commercial risk would be at a high level with a risk severity equals to 0.034 and completion risk would be at a low level with a risk severity equals to 0.003. Using this approach, the occurrence of risks at various stages of the project can also be predicted. EVM is found to be a convenient and accurate method to identify risks that might occur and prepare a contingency plan to avoid further losses.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

Some of these chemicals, such as polyphenols, can be found in high concentrations in nature. However, others are present in such low concentrations that significant harvesting is vital to achieving sufficient quantities, and chemical synthesis is unprofitable due to their structural diversity and complexity. Because screening and synthesizing these compounds are complex, new technologies have been created. The most common approach is traditional liquid or solid–liquid extraction also termed solvent extraction, although modern approaches comprise supercritical and subcritical extractions, pressured liquid extraction, along with microwave and ultrasound-assisted extractions.

Although the literature on the subject is extensive and includes multiple correlation strategies, validation of most of these methods has been performed on simple structures, such as beams or plates. In contrast, their validity for application in more complex structures under more realistic damage scenarios deserves further investigation. In this work, a method called Precision-Recall curve based on the confusion matrix is proposed to objectively evaluate the performance of spectral correlation methods for structural damage detection from vibration data sets. The Precision-Recall curve is then condensed into a scalar value using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric. The work is based on extensive experimental lab tests that use three different structures with decreasing modal information, challenging the detection of damage scenarios. In addition, the effects of noise and frequency range are studied as key factors that can reduce or improve the performance of the indicators. The work results also validate the method based on the Complex Frequency Domain Assurance Criterion (CFDAC) previously proposed by the authors in structures with scarce modal information. Finally, experimental evidence allows conclusions to be drawn on the performance of different indicators available in the literature.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

These pipelines system is vital as it generates significant cash revenue to the facilities. However, the structural health of pipeline deteriorates over time due to various damage mechanism. Any Loss of Primary Containment (LOPC) to the pipelines can lead to heavy business losses. Facility engineers will normally apply the most common approach to mitigate the LOPC by providing schedule maintenance, perform repair activities as well as system replacement. These activities are mostly controlled manually by the engineers. This paper will focus on the prediction of structural health monitoring of gasoline pipeline located in one of the facilities in Malaysia, using historical inspection reports by means Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) regression techniques. The collected data was analyzed and applied on these two methods to determine the best fitness and performance. It is noticed that both Bayesian-regularization ANN and exponential GPR model demonstrate better performance compared to the others when assessed based on the highest R 2 value. The results were deemed satisfactory as the R 2 value for both methods were close to 1.0. The results also showed that both ANN and GPR models were almost equal in predicting the structural health of a pipeline with an accuracy of 99% and 97.3%, respectively. This work may help in controlling/monitoring the inspection cost and to preplan the maintenance scheduling for gasoline pipeline network in oil and gas industry.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks', 'Energy Storage']"

Among them, person identification is crucial because it is the premise for any personalized services. Our prior work using footstep-induced structural vibration has been promising in identifying a fixed group of people, but it is restricted to registered occupants, leading to errors whenever a stranger appears. Therefore, we introduce a stranger detection and occupant identification system using footstep-induced structural vibrations. There are two main challenges in developing this system: 1) the strangers’ walking patterns are unknown before being observed, and 2) the probability of the presence of a stranger varies at different times and locations. To overcome the first challenge, we model the occupants’ and strangers’ footstep-induced floor vibration data as a mixture of Gaussian distributions with varying number of components, representing the changing number of registered people. To address the second challenge, we reformulated the prior estimation in the mixture model by introducing an interpretable parameter that represents the expected probability of observing a stranger.

This chapter will focus on two elements aiming at understanding, predicting, measuring and quality-assuring constructs with examples from memory measurements: (i) explicit methods for testing theories of the measurement mechanism and establishment of metrological standards and (ii) substantive theories explaining the constructs themselves. Building on entropy as a principal explanatory variable, analogous to its use in thermodynamics and information theory, we demonstrate how more fit-for-purpose and valid memory measurements can be enabled. Firstly, memory task difficulty, extracted from a Rasch psychometric analysis of memory measurements of experimental data such as from the European NeuroMET project, can be explained with a construct specification equation (CSE). Based on that understanding, the CSE can facilitate the establishment of objective and scalable units through the generation of novel certified reference “materials” for metrological traceability and comparability. These formulations of CSEs can also guide how best to compose new memory metrics, through a judicious choice of items from various legacy tests guided by entropy-based equivalence, which opens up opportunities for formulating new, less onerous but more sensitive and representative tests. Finally, we propose and demonstrate how to formulate CSEs for person ability, correlated statistically and clinically with sets of biomarkers, that can be a means of providing diagnostic information to enhance clinical decisions and targeted interventions.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Health Informatics', 'Psychometrics', 'Health Administration']"

In order for operators, certifying bodies, insurance entities and government agencies to agree on a lifetime extension, a commonly accepted lifetime assessment strategy with proven results is required. This paper aims to provide such an answer through a data-driven lifetime assessment approach using SHM and SCADA data. The research involves training neural network (NN) models using SCADA and SHM data to estimate the fore-aft damage equivalent moment (DEM) at the tower interface level on a 10-min basis for implementation in a data-driven lifetime assessment. The NN are trained and validated based on one instrumented turbine (the fleetleader ) and cross-validated based on another instrumented turbine. A DEM representative for the lifetime of the asset is calculated based on the 10-min DEM’s. An analysis of the NN models’ performance (error of 10-min DEM estimation in relation to DEM derived from SHM data) and accuracy (lifetime DEM error) is undertaken.

In the late nineteenth century ‘blackbirding’ brought the migration of workers, both men and women, from what are now Vanuatu and Solomon Islands, to work in Queensland sugar cane plantations. Over time migration became more voluntary. Most workers returned home, bringing economic benefits and some social costs, before the end of this migration early in the twentieth century. Migration from Pacific island states subsequently became more diverse and from the 1960s steady international migration from the Polynesian states—notably Tonga and Samoa—became significant, alongside remittances to those states. Tuvalu and Kiribati trained workers for migration, while from the 1970s onwards, Australia considered the possibility of instituting a formal migration scheme.","['Social Sciences', 'Human Geography', 'Migration', 'Geography, general', 'Development Studies']"

As close human-to-human contact can spread the COVID-19 causing virus, keeping social distance is now an absolute necessity as a preventative measure. At a time of global pandemic, there is a huge need to treat patients with little patient–doctor interaction by using robots. Robots can be characterized as machines that can execute a wide range of tasks with greater autonomy and degree of freedom (DoF) than humans, making it difficult to identify them from other machines. A wide range of equipment, sensors, and information and communication technology (ICT) are now part of the healthcare system, which has become increasingly complicated. Protecting front-line personnel from virus exposure is the primary goal of using robots in health care. The aim of this study is to emphasize the evolving importance of robotics applications in health care and related fields.

These farming systems are gradually facing challenges in maintaining high yields that can ensure food security. This chapter seeks to examine the farming technological innovations that the Kejom Ketinguh people have adopted as a solution to the failing traditional farming system to boost food production, hence guarantee of food security. In order to gather data for this study, a qualitative method was employed where interviews and focus group discussions were used. Content analysis was used to analyse the data through interviews and focus group discussions. The analyses in this chapter reveal diverse issues, of which some are worth mentioning here. First, the uptake of farming technological innovations in the area of study has enabled increase in food production; second, food production, especially market gardening, is carried out throughout the year, irrespective of the season. Third, most traditional farming techniques, which are not productive, have gradually phased out. Fourth, the adapted farming innovation practices are gradually integrated in the cultural mores of the Kejom people, thus making it more comprehensible for food production, hence securing food at all times for the people. The findings in this chapter disclose that with the uptake of farming technological innovations in the area of study, and possibly beyond, food production is being ensured throughout the year. Continuous food production guarantees food security, which is a fundamental human right to all persons irrespective of age.","['Chemistry', 'Food Science', 'Agriculture']"

For example, the boring of tunnels can affect infrastructures located on the surface. Therefore, devices are required for the monitoring of every building in the area of interest. Topographic surveying is one of the most popular techniques for the monitoring of buildings and civil infrastructures. Standard optical prisms are targeted with high frequencies by Robotic Total Stations (RTS). In order to estimate 3D displacements of each prism, static control points are needed. These points must be located outside the area of interest. However, it is not always possible in dense urban areas. In this study, the use of GNSS receivers as control points for topographic surveying is proposed. In this case, control points do not need to be static because their global positions are known. The methodology is explained and the required additional processing steps are outlined.

These imaging methods develop integration between anatomy and clinically oriented medical study as well as biomechanics. The progressive research in anatomy can benefit from the vast field of biomechanics which allows for precise and conclusive results regarding the biomechanical integrity of anatomical structures and allows for intricate planning of procedures. 3D imaging techniques have enhanced the modelling of internal structures which are especially essential when implemented as diagnostic tools. An integration of these modalities into medical training accommodates for a more clinically orientated and immediate visualisation as produced when utilising ultrasound imaging which has the added advantage of 3D modelling and manipulation.

There are two approaches how to utilize PZT sensors for SHM purposes. One of the approaches follows closely classical ultrasonic testing. In that case, short-pulse excitation of PZT transducers is used, thus guided wave packets can be scattered on different elements of structure, eventually also on the damage itself. The disturbance of the scattered wavefield is the basis of damage detection and evaluation. In the different approach harmonic excitation of PZT is used, thus steady elastic waves are excited in the structure. The signal can be gathered in the pulse-echo scheme, i.e., when a single transducer is used both as an actuator and a receiver of waves, as well in the pitch-catch scheme, when a pair of transducers is used. An approach for damage detection with use of a network of PZT sensors excited with harmonic signals in the pitch-catch scheme will be presented and its properties and damage detection capabilities will be discussed.

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is one such remote sensing technique that is widely used to compute vegetation cover change. Remote sensing and Geographical Information System methods are used often in examining natural resources, determination of land changes and related planning work. The methodology discussed in this study is based on association with vegetation remote sensed data in the form of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The major application of this index is to monitor the vegetative cover. NDVI is a function of reflected Near Infrared (NIR) and Visible (VIS) radiance’s spectral contrast from a surface. A further study is made on the calculated NDVI to evaluate the agricultural drought index in the form of Vegetation Health Index. This index comprises of Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST). Vegetation health is assessed based on VHI, which is suitable indicator of agricultural drought extent. A correlation is studied statistically between NDVI, VHI, precipitation and temperature.

This follows the axioms of SHM, which identify a certain relationship between the frequency and time of observation and the extent (and therefore severity) of ongoing damage. For this reason, in the present paper, interferometric displacement satellite data acquired for a decade on the territory of the city of Rome (Italy) are investigated and correlated to natural phenomena. The paper critically analyzes the possibility of a relationship between these phenomena and satellite data in order to bring out a common pattern. The study of natural and anthropogenic phenomena in the same frequency bandwidth as the interferometric satellite data would therefore be useful for recognizing potential triggering causes of higher frequency phenomena, which could appear as sudden and unstable phenomena if observed with shorter times. In the paper, the authors first make a comparison between natural phenomena and satellite data on a territorial scale and then focus on a series of isolated case studies (single structures and infrastructures).","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

We have therefore performed a nationwide epidemiological study in Estonia, addressing incidence, demographics, interventions and mortality of AMI. Methods A retrospective population-based review was conducted of all adult cases of AMI accrued from the digital Estonian Health Insurance Fund and Causes of Death Registry for 2016–2020 based on international classification of diseases (ICD-10) diagnostic codes and procedure codes (NOMESCO). Results Overall, 577 cases of AMI were identified—an annual incidence of 8.7 per 100,000. The median age was 79 (range 32–104) and 57% were female. Predominating comorbidities included hypertensive disease (81%), atherosclerosis (67%), and atrial fibrillation (52%). The majority of cases (60%) were caused by superior mesenteric artery occlusion (thrombosis 54%, embolism 12%, and unclear 34%). Inferior mesenteric artery occlusion occurred in 7%, non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia in 7%, venous thrombosis in 4%, whereas the type remained unclear in 21% of cases. 40% of patients received intervention (revascularization and/or intestinal resection) and 13% active non-operative treatment. In 21% an exploratory laparotomy or laparoscopy revealed unsalvageable bowel prompting end-of-life care, which was the only management in a further 25% of cases. Conclusions The population-based annual incidence of AMI in Estonia was 8.7 per 100,000 during the study period. The overall hospital mortality and 1 year mortality were 64% and 74%, respectively. In the 53% of patients who received active treatment hospital mortality was 32% and 1 year all-cause mortality was 51%.

Therefore, the detection and classification of arrhythmias are essential for diagnosing patients with cardiac abnormalities. With new technologies, we can see the opening of medical institutions toward health information technology systems. To give researchers an overview of existing works about health monitoring systems for heart patients, we have established a comparative study between recent and well-known methods based on their results. The focus is in this comparison on the features used, the signal length, the datasets used, features extraction methods, features selection methods, classification methods, and the performances of each method. Furthermore, we classified these works by disease types (Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation PAF, Atrial Fibrillation AF, Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia VTA such as Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) and Ventricular Fibrillation (VF), Sudden Cardiac Death SCD, Obstructive Sleep Apnea OSA). According to this comparative study, it has been found that many studies got exciting results. However, the classification rate achieved remains moderate. Moreover, heart rate monitoring devices are not within reach of the average citizen in terms of price and prediction time, and more studies are needed using more extensive databases. This study gives a comprehensive view of what is currently being done to monitor heart patients’ health. After discussing the achievements and limitations of existing approaches to monitoring the status of cardiac patients, we conclude by providing several potential research directions for the future.","['Engineering', 'Complexity', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control and Systems Theory']"

Data is sometimes encrypted for multiple authentication tiers, with a semi-authorized user gaining access to data scrubbed of sensitive or personal information, while a fully authorized user recovering the entire signal. Hence, in this paper, an encryption and classification process is done on the basis of AES together with chaotic logistic mapping for the purpose of ECG signal encryption as well as decryption. The feature extraction is accomplished by CNN. Finally, the data classification is done with the help of SVM. The suggested strategy achieves better classification accuracy in experimental verification, which is significantly superior to traditional classification algorithms.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

The process is often carried out over days and requires significant medical expertise in the psychological domain. Also, the diagnosis of these disorders is often late thus making it difficult to be treated. Most existing data for computational analysis is carefully collected and curated before analysis is carried out. This causes a dearth of publicly available datasets. We have designed a computational approach through which we analyze over a million tweets over Twitter from a set of people with self-proclaimed mental disorders. Our model could effectively identify the necessary aspects for different disorders and predict the onset of mental illness before the patient comes to realize the disorder. The proposed approach functions strictly on publicly available data with no added annotations.

Geriatric people need more attention as well as help. They do not want dependencies on their relatives or friends. They need their independence. In such a case helping these people is the challenge. Many senior people have a partial or complete loss of memory, and they need to travel for their daily chores. They need assistance in traveling in various forms, especially locomotive and mobility. Finding the perfect balance between the help and independence of the said individual is the challenge.

In this paper, we explored the application of ML to biological data from Alzheimer’s disease patients. We trained ten classification models that used fecal 16S rRNA sequence data to differentiate between subjects affected by Alzheimer’s disease (AD), pre-onset amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients (aMCI), and healthy controls (HC) (n = 93 patients, 33 AD, 32 aMCI, 28 HC). Before the classification process, bioinformatics analysis was performed using the QIIME2–2021.4 tool which resulted in profiling microbiome communities present in host organisms. Alpha diversity metrics were calculated using three different indexes (Shannon’s diversity index, Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity, and Observed OTUs) while Kruskal–Wallis test was used to confirm significant difference (p-value < 0.05) between study groups. To achieve binary classification, the dataset was divided into three subsets each containing two groups (AD vs aMCI, AD vs HC, aMCI vs HC) Prior to the classification process, SelectKBest with the f_classif algorithm was used as univariate feature selection to reduce the number of features in each group to top five. 5-fold cross-validation yielded high accuracy results (going over 70%) for a number of classifiers, with the highest accuracy reach of 78.3% (via Logistic Regression) in the case of distinguishing between aMCI and HC subjects. Our results showed that a machine learning algorithm can be developed and achieve high precision (>78%) with relatively few parameters. Such a model can be used to support decision-making in medicine by gathering the data through a non-invasive technique.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Here the waves are generate using PZT transduction that requires excitation inputs using either high voltage or high current or both. Several critical applications such as component in explosion susceptible environment, extreme temperature condition, etc. have limitations in deployment of high voltage/current excitation. In this paper, the use of wave-guide-based excitation is explored for plate and pipe like geometries. The waveguide help isolate the excitation part of the ultrasound generation, away from the component that may be in a hostile condition. The ultrasound wave modes excited in the waveguide is coupled to the structure and optimized to generate the desired guided wave modes in the geometry of the structures using Finite Element Wave Propagation models. The reception of these modes are also explored using similar ultrasonic waveguides. The detection of defects, in an SHM mode, using this remote generation approach is also demonstrated on a plate geometry component. This article demonstrates the detection of fundamental symmetric wave mode (S0), shear horizontal waves (SH0) and antisymmetric wave mode (A0) in an steel plate by placing a thin wire-like stainless steel waveguide sensor. In order to uniquely identify the three-fundamental plate-guided modes, we map the experimentally measured group velocities as detected by the waveguide sensor to theoretically obtained group velocity dispersion curves. The analytically obtained FEM results are evaluated experimentally using time-of-flight measurements. In future, this sensor arrangement may be utilized in areas like high-temperature furnaces, engines and aircrafts for detecting cracks.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

In this chapter, a brief introduction provides some statistics on the volume and composition of waste materials generated across the world and different waste classifications that are commonly used. This is followed by a review of current waste treatment technologies for three broad groups of waste materials, namely: Municipal solid waste materials Industrial waste materials Low-level radioactive waste materials In each of these groups, attention is given to the unique role thermal plasma technology can play for the safe and reliable treatment of the waste material and niche opportunities for the recovery of valuable products from the waste. In a field as vast and diversified as waste treatment, it is unrealistic to attempt to treat it in an exhaustive manner in a single chapter.

All of these tasks require a wind farm model that can accurately predict turbine behaviours in response to the changing environment. Recent studies focus on developing data-based methods for predictive maintenance purposes. This paper proposes a data-based model that aims to capture the spatial and temporal wind variations across a wind farm, as a means to predict the interactions between operating turbines and the environment, which can be useful for wind farm performance monitoring. The proposed method is a Gaussian process-based spatial autoregressive model, which reflects our physical understanding of the wake effect while taking the advantage of a stochastic data-driven learner. In the case study of a simulated wind farm, the proposed model (named here a GP-SPARX model) provides the best predictive accuracy in comparison to two other spatial autoregressive regression models, showing its capability of capturing nonlinear correlations and its potential as a low-cost wake field predictor given inputs from weather station measurements.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Consumer demand and ongoing technical advancement cause a serious problem as a consequence of this need and consumption. One of the issues now plaguing the world that is growing the quickest is E-waste. This article looks at how virtualization may abate the amount of e-waste produced and save resources. A comparison of E-waste management strategies and the optimal choice taking into account green computing has been shown. The model, which uses annual product sales data as well as historical and projected sales data as inputs, is a material flow analysis model. Future sales data are predicted using polynomial regression analysis for goods with increasing yearly sales and the sales rate for products with declining annual sales. Software that enables a single computer to perform several identical executions, each of which runs an operating system, is known as a hypervisor, or virtual machine monitor. By using those resources and the information from the models, the overall discussion on virtualization’s potential to reduce e-waste may be evaluated. As fewer portable computers and desktop computers are used, less electrical equipment is needed, which reduces the amount of power required. The hypervisor may also be set up to show how much less electronic waste results from virtualization. Therefore, even if virtualization won’t completely eradicate e-waste, it will significantly reduce it while having no negative effects on the environment.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The ice layer increases the blade masses, influences aerodynamics, and can fall off anytime during rotation with unpredictable trajectory and impact on ground. Due to this potential risk to human life, operation needs to be interrupted. Turbines equipped with blade heating face a downtime of some minutes to hours until removal of ice and restart of operation. Older turbines without heating system might stand still for a longer duration, resulting in significant loss of generated electricity. Modern Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems either detect icing by sophisticated measurement systems in the rotor blades, for example fiber Bragg grating devices, or predict the presence of ice by a combination of measured moisture, temperature and wind speed. Wireless acceleration sensors on the turbine tower may detect icing, monitor ice growth and even predict time of alert. The present work discusses the surveillance of an existing power plant by both wireless and wired acceleration sensors in parallel to the ice alerts of the turbine’s SCADA system and change of key parameters for indication of icing status.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Although “big data” can provide valuable and significant contributions to many areas of food safety, it also raises important questions about security, privacy, data control, data governance, transparency, de-identification, and anonymization that must be carefully considered by governments and lawmakers. The development of regulatory policies and regulations related to big data in food safety is still in its infancy. In addition, countries around the world have different laws and regulations regarding data privacy. The privacy of customers and citizens is regulated by data policies, data laws, statutes, and general government legislation. Furthermore, each country may have its own interpretation and set of rules and laws related to digital data, big data, and open data. The main challenges related to privacy are unjustified surveillance actions, incorrect results and/or projections, the use of biased data, and unapproved secondary uses of personal information. Advances in digital technologies occur very rapidly, which can make it very difficult for protection laws and legal systems to follow. The food industry collects a lot of data, likely more than all of government combined. Having access to this data to help inform not only risk assessments but also policy and regulations is extremely valuable. Greater advancements in the collection and use of big data in the food safety area will depend on the organization and execution of high-level standard specifications and the development of increased privacy protection. This will require the cooperation of all countries that see the tremendous benefits of big data sharing to drive continuous improvement in food safety.","['Life Sciences', 'Food Microbiology', 'Big Data', 'Big Data/Analytics', 'Food Science']"

Einer der wichtigsten Risikofaktoren für das Auftreten und einen komplizierten Verlauf von Infektionen ist die Neutropenie. Patienten mit Hochrisiko-Neutropenie (absolute Neutrophilenzahl <0,5 × 10 9 /l für ≥8 Tage) und Fieber sollen empirisch ein Pseudomonas- aktives β-Lactam-Antibiotikum (z. B. Piperacillin/Tazobactam oder Ceftazidim) erhalten. Eine Kombination mit einem Glykopeptid (z. B. Vancomycin) oder einem Aminoglykosid (z. B. Tobramycin) sollte in der klinischen Routine nicht erfolgen. Aktuelle Leitlinien empfehlen bei klinischer Stabilität auch bei Patienten mit Hochrisiko-Neutropenie und persistierendem Fieber nach 72–96 Stunden die primäre empirische Antibiotikatherapie fortzusetzen. Weiterhin ist es bei klinisch stabilen Patienten mit febriler Neutropenie und anhaltendem Fieber gerechtfertigt, ein Schimmelpilz-wirksames Antimykotikum (z. B. liposomales Amphotericin B) erst einzusetzen, wenn sich klinisch, serologisch (z. B. Nachweis von Galactomannan oder 1➔3-β-D-Glucan im Serum) oder bildgebend Hinweise für das Vorliegen einer invasiven Pilzinfektion zeigen (präemptiver Therapieansatz). Als wichtiger Hinweis für das Vorliegen einer pulmonalen Aspergillose gilt hierbei das Halo-Zeichen in der Thorax-Computertomografie. Bei Patienten mit drohender oder manifester klinischer Instabilität sollte ein frühzeitiger Einsatz eines Schimmelpilz-wirksamen Antimykotikums immer in Erwägung gezogen werden, d. h. auch wenn sich keine Hinweise für das Vorliegen einer invasiven Pilzinfektion ergeben (empirischer Therapieansatz). Neben FUO treten klinisch oder mikrobiologisch dokumentierte Infektionen unabhängig vom Vorliegen einer Neutropenie bei Tumorpatienten häufig auf. Blutstrominfektionen, Infektionen des Respirationstrakts und die Clostridioides-difficile -assoziierte Diarrhö gehören hierbei zu den häufigsten Formen.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Oncology', 'Internal Medicine', 'Gynecology', 'Urology']"

Adoption of these concepts in the USA has been slower than in a number of other nations, including Sweden, The Netherlands, UK and Australia. Whereas adoption in other nations began as early as the late 1990s, interest in Safe Systems in the USA followed by about a decade. One factor associated with this delay is the success that the USA experienced with public safety and compliance methods, such as high-visibility traffic law enforcement, during the period in which the Safe System movement took hold in other countries. National road safety professional organizations were among the first in the USA to shift toward zero-focused strategies. City and state governments followed and the federal government took steps in this direction after local and state efforts were well underway. By 2020, discussion of Safe Systems was taking place in national professional associations and early steps had been taken toward federal institutional support. Although implementation in the USA is not yet widespread, lessons have been learned in building public and political support for Safe Systems. Managing public expectations regarding short-term safety benefits is likely to be a key to longer-term Safe Systems support. Increased efforts are needed to inform political leaders at the local, state and national levels of the benefits of Safe Systems and Vision Zero as well as additional education for safety practitioners.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-07258-1_69,en,A Novel Approach for Preload Monitoring in Bolted Connections Using Electro-Mechanical Impedance Spectra,OriginalPaper,"The functionality of bolted connections depends significantly on the conservation of the bolt’s preload, which entails the necessity to monitor these components. Traditional monitoring techniques using electro-mechanical impedance spectra are based on the observation of the structural resonances and antiresonances. The change of structural resonances is clearly mirrored for example in the resistance spectrum. This paper introduces a novel approach for such a monitoring process utilizing the susceptance. The susceptance is the imaginary part of the impedance’s reciprocal. In an experimental setup, where piezoelectric wafer active sensors have been attached to the bolt’s head, different preload stages of these components were set. It has been observed that the elastic mechanical deformation of the bolt’s head, which is caused by the preload, affects the piezoelectric wafer active sensor. As the properties of the sensor are well pronounced especially in the susceptance spectrum, a condition index based on the susceptance is proposed. Usually varying ambient temperature can occur in practical applications of bolted connections. It needs to be differentiated from the changes of the preload conditions in order to avoid false alarm of the monitoring system. Therefore, the proposed condition index has been additionally investigated in dependence on varying ambient temperature. The experiments show very promising results.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

However, most Indonesians still rely on groundwater or tap water as their primary water source. Rainwater harvesting is a feasible technology to be applied to decrease the dependency on the current water source. A simple rainwater harvesting using rooftop is considered to be applicable in a residential area. This study calculated the typical storage tank for rainwater harvesting based on the house type in Indonesia. Two scenarios were used during the calculation. In the first scenario, storage was designed to collect water during rainfall to be used during the rainy season only. In the second scenario, the tank was designed to collect rainwater to be used for the whole year. Calculation results showed the number of typical storage tank (⌀ 1.8 m and height of 1.9 m) required for the tiny house type was 1 tank, the medium house type was 1–2 tanks, and the large house type was 3–6 tanks. In the second scenario, the number of storage tanks for each type of house was 25 tanks. The second scenario is suggested to be used in areas where water scarcity is the main issue during the dry season, while the first scenario is suggested to be applied for a user with no land availability and construction cost issues.","['Energy', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Construction Management', 'Facility Management']"

So the damage diagnosis is an essential part in health monitoring of structures. Damage in a structure leads to change in the dynamic response which will be helpful for diagnosis of the structure. The relation between modal response and damage vector is in such a way that there exist unique change in response for unique damage. So damage detection is an inverse problem where it is required to relate the modal response to the damage state. Problems of damage detection are too intricate and the distinct boundary between crisp values cannot be identified for expressing the damage level and measurement deltas. Thus, mapping technique like Fuzzy Logic Inference System (FLIS) can be used for such problems. A fuzzy logic will operate on linguistic variables and associate the data (structural response) with the damage conditions and provide output as level of damage and damage location. In this study, the change of modal response due to damage in a cantilever beam is investigated and a FLIS is designed for the structural health monitoring purpose. The change in natural frequency is the measurement delta. FLIS is designed using data pool obtained from Finite Element (FE) analysis of different damaged scenarios of the specimen. The FLIS is tested with noise up to 20% and it is found to be robust against small contamination in measurement deltas.","['Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences']"

A series of dynamic load tests were conducted immediately after construction on a continuous three-span FRP-RC bridge deck to capture its dynamic responses under intact conditions. A detailed finite element (FE) model was developed and validated against the experimental results. This model allows for the simulation and study of the bridge dynamic behavior after cracking develops at different locations along the deck. The effects of cracking severity and location on the bridge were investigated using natural frequency and mode shapes changes. The numerical results showed that natural frequency and mode shape changes are sufficiently sensitive for detecting cracks in the FRP-RC bridge deck. Additional dynamic load tests are scheduled for this bridge so that experimental data, possibly obtained from a cracked deck, can be used to calibrate the FE model after some damage. While recognizing that corrosion is a non-issue for FRP-RC structures, the ultimate question that this research attempts to answer is how the deck flexural stiffness changes over time as the result of traffic loads and possibly predict a service life expectation based on stiffness degradation.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

This chapter focuses on three prominent values found in Latinx families that weave into the educational experiences of children and youth in schooling. Among the cultural values important in socializing Latinx children is respeto (respect) that emphasizes and dictates knowing the level of courtesy and decorum required in a given situation and delineates the boundaries of appropriate and inappropriate behavior. Understanding the Latinx value of “ bien educado ” (well-educated or well-mannered) is also important in understanding the uniquely nuanced behaviors Latinx children bring to the classroom. Bien educado is a broad construct that generally reflects strong socialization along several behaviors including comportment, composure, meeting role obligations, obedience, respect, and self-reliance expectations of Latinx children.

Increased use has shown they are able to outperform legacy materials when used correctly and maintained well. On the contrary, issues around susceptibility to impact damage in-service and high manufacturing costs have limited applications in other areas. Several SHM-technologies have been successfully used to address many of the in-service monitoring needs. The aim of this work is to build upon a proven SHM system based on fiber optic sensors and develop a complementing integral manufacturing process monitoring regime. Distributed fiber optic sensors based on Rayleigh Optical Backscattering Reflectometry (OBR) are utilized in this research to capture key characteristics over a large area with high spatial resolution. The OBR sensors can monitor the entirety of a product’s life and not just certain aspects of it, thus providing feedback in the manufacturing stage and enabling quality improvements. The presented work assesses OBR for its merit with regards to manufacturing monitoring. The focus lies on the most important factors in liquid resin infusion of a dry fiber bed. The OBR sensor was integrated into the woven fabric during the manufacturing process to provide vital information on the fabric compaction level and infusion parameters. Those factors have great influence on the quality of the manufactured component. In a second stage, several adverse processing conditions, typical for Resin Infusion were simulated and the system’s detection capability of such flaws is analyzed. The results obtained reliably inform the vacuum pressure level and detect manufacturing process errors with millimeter-level spatial resolution. With the added potential for real-time data streaming online parameter changes can be made based on the sensor readings. This confirms the aptitude of the chosen OFDR sensing method and provides the basis for a highly integrated Life-Cycle management system.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The World Health Organization (WHO) tracks and classifies variants as variants of concern (VOCs) or variants of interest (VOIs), depending on the level of transmissibility and dominance of the variant in the regions. The classification and identification of variants usually occur through sequence alignment techniques, which are computationally complex, making them unfeasible to classify thousands of sequences simultaneously. In this work, an application of the alignment-free method BASiNETEntropy is proposed for the classification of the variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2. The method initially maps the biological sequences as a complex network. From this, the most informative edges are selected through the entropy maximization principle, getting a filtered network containing only the most informative edges. Thus, complex network topological measurements are extracted and used as features vectors in the classification process. Sequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern extracted from NCBI were used to assess the method. Experimental results show that extracted features can classify the variants of concern with high assertiveness, considering few features, contributing to the reduction of the feature space. Besides classifying the variants of concern, unique patterns (motifs) were also extracted for each variant, relative to the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence.

Studies have indicated that good IEQ can enhance occupants' health, wellbeing, and productivity. Occupant feedback surveys are beneficial for gathering end-user perceptions and determining occupant requirements for efficient building operations and management. Identifying gaps in building performance provides opportunities to ensure that occupant IEQ needs are better addressed during the operations phase. This paper presents the results of occupant feedback surveys administered at an educational institution in the US. The 435 survey responses were analyzed to draw out the key findings in relation to the IEQ, occupant behavior, and occupant satisfaction. From the survey responses relating to temperature preferences, 65.5% of the participants indicated that they preferred temperatures between 20 °C (68 °F) and 21.67 °C (71 °F) in the winter. Overall, 48.1% were moderately dissatisfied, dissatisfied, or very dissatisfied with the thermal conditions in their office. The source of discomfort for most occupants was the inability to control the temperature since the thermostat was inaccessible or controlled by others. Occupant mean satisfaction with other IEQ parameters (i.e., lighting, air quality, and noise) are discussed. This paper also elucidates the critical factors from the occupant feedback surveys pertaining to IEQ in their work environments. It provides recommendations to improve IEQ and occupant satisfaction during the operations phase. Effective communication between the end-user and the building operations and maintenance department can potentially improve occupant satisfaction and lower energy consumption.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

Hence, the deployment of a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system is highly relevant to safeguard their structural integrity. Typically, an SHM system includes a Damage Detection (DD) scheme, which aims to identify structural damages by using information recorded by the sensing system. Plenty of DD schemes have been proposed for various types of structures. However, several peculiarities of the offshore platforms, being associated with the near impossibility to operate sensors underwater, can challenge the performance of conventional DD schemes. In this context, the current study emphasizes the development of a new Kalman filter-based framework that is anticipated to estimate the location and severity of the damage. Especially, the DD problem is approached as an input-state estimation problem for nonlinear systems. The main objective of this method is to identify and quantify the damages induced by wave loads in terms of, for example, plastic deformations. Advanced modeling techniques are required for this task. The proposed DD scheme is tested on a 2D steel jacket structure subjected to wave loading. The outcome of the specific DD scheme is expected to provide the damage profile of the structure after various hazardous events.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

However, cellular neurophysiologists have identified two broad classes of plasticity. Hebbian forms of plasticity alter synaptic strength in a synapse specific manner in the same direction of the initial conditioning stimulation. In contrast, homeostatic plasticities act globally over longer time frames in a negative feedback manner to counter network level changes in activity or synaptic strength. Recent evidence suggests that homeostatic plasticity mechanisms can be rapidly engaged, particularly by fast-acting antidepressants such as ketamine to trigger behavioral effects. There is increasing evidence that several neuropsychoactive compounds either directly elicit changes in synaptic activity or indirectly tap into downstream signaling pathways to trigger homeostatic plasticity and subsequent behavioral effects. In this review, we discuss this recent work in the context of a wider paradigm where homeostatic synaptic plasticity mechanisms may provide novel targets for neuropsychiatric treatment advance.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Psychiatry', 'Neurosciences', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Biological Psychology']"

This new generation of biomedical sensors targets to be interconnected in ways that improve our lives and transform the medical industry. Therefore, they offer an excellent opportunity to integrate the next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) based techniques in medical devices. However, several key challenges remain in achieving this potential due to the inherent resource-constrained nature of wearable systems for Big Data medical applications, which need to detect pathologies in real time. Concretely, in this chapter, we discuss the opportunities for edge computing and edge AI in next-generation intelligent biomedical sensors in the IoT era and the key challenges in wearable systems design for pathology detection and health/activity monitoring in the context of IoT technologies. First, we introduce the notion of self-awareness toward the conception of the next-generation intelligent edge biomedical sensors to trade-off machine-learning performance versus system lifetime, according to the application requirements of the medical monitoring systems. Subsequently, we present the implications of personalization and multi-parametric sensing in the context of the system-level architecture of intelligent edge biomedical sensors. Thus, they can adapt to the real world, as living organisms do, to operate efficiently according to the target application requirements and available energy at any moment in time. Then, we discuss the impacts of self-awareness and low-power requirements at the circuit level for sampling through a paradigm shift to react to the input signal itself. Finally, we conclude by highlighting that the techniques discussed in this chapter may be applied jointly to design the next-generation intelligent biomedical sensors and systems in the IoT era.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Electronic Circuits and Devices', 'Processor Architectures', 'Nanotechnology', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation']"

In the field of aerospace applications, the current research project “Combined acoustic and modal structure monitoring” is dealing with the development of a robust SHM system for damage identification in carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) structures under realistic and varying loads. The methods combined within the project are based on guided waves, acoustic emission, and different vibration monitoring techniques. The present paper deals with the application of the nullspace-based fault detection algorithm (NSFD) as a part of a holistic concept for the monitoring of an aircraft door surround structure. Due to the great sensitivity to changes in the statistical properties of the measured data, the algorithm reacts very sensitively to structural changes, but also to changes in the environmental conditions, such as changes in the external loads. In this paper, the impact of changing excitation conditions on the NSFD damage indicator is analyzed. Therefore, two different formulations for the NSFD algorithm are studied and compared concerning their sensitivity and robustness against changes of the external loads. Since the sensitivity and the results depend also on the algorithm set-up parameters, these are analyzed and taken into account. The evaluation of the results considers both, the robustness to the influence of the varying excitation and the sensitivity to damages in the analyzed structure. The theory and the algorithms are successfully tested with measured data sets from a CFRP-airplane structure.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

This OPEX and harmful effects should be decreased to achieve sustainable and profitable businesses for mobile operators. In this case, a hybrid renewable energy solution like solar energy and wind power is proposed which will be used to power these cellular base stations. Solar energy can power daytime and wind power can power both day and nighttime. Thus, together they can supply power efficiently. When a particular base station fails, or its workload is high then its workload can be transferred to another base station for a certain amount of period. Sometimes a base station’s workload can be transferred to another idle base station. Base stations can be switched to sleep mode when data traffic is low. This can help to save a lot of electric energy. The final result will be a sustainable cellular base station. Most of the goals can be achieved by our proposed method like less energy consumption, carbon-free service, and less radio frequency (RF).

Despite this enduring 1970s aesthetic Aesthetics trope, the sociocultural context in which brothels operate has changed markedly. With the emergence of sex as leisure and a broader neoliberal commitment to corporate normativity over moral censure, sex industry managers have undertaken to explicitly mainstream their businesses. In doing so, they also reinforce cis-heteronormative codes and values that erase racialised, gender expansive and other non-conforming sex worker bodies. Setting out the accounts of brothel operators and sex workers, this chapter engages with the ways that these norms disrupt sex workers’ identities and self-determination, in turn reinforcing stigma and discrimination in inequitable ways. The community of the brothel, essential to sex workers’ safety and group identity, is, therefore, reconceptualised as a site for enforcing norms of productivity and exclusion. The controls exacted over sex workers within the brothel are also explored through the positioning of brothel operators in parental or familial roles, instantiating obligations for conformity on the part of sex workers. Lastly, norms of authenticity are reproduced in the promotion of sex work as a private realm activity, which has implications for sex workers’ position as autonomous professionals.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime and Society', 'Critical Criminology', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Gender Studies', 'Social Policy', 'Politics of the Welfare State']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-030-76505-7_44,en,Vision Zero on Fire Safety,OriginalPaper,"Since 2010, Sweden has a Vision Zero policy on fire safety: no one should die or be seriously injured as a result of fire. Compared to the traffic safety model, however, the preconditions for successful implementation appear more immature and less convincing in the fire area. The purpose of this chapter is to illustrate, using the Vision Zero policy on fire safety as an example, how a Vision Zero initiative in a new area, where the conditions for governance may differ significantly from the area of inspiration, can be dealt with as a dynamic process to gradually establish credibility and effectiveness. Globally, fire is a significant cause of death and injury. The general trend is toward a slow decline, especially among middle-income and high-income countries. The decline may be due to successful fire safety efforts, but also to other conditions affecting it indirectly. Both risk-increasing and risk-reducing factors determine fire safety. Risk increasing factors include an ageing population, an increasing diversity of possible ignition sources, and a change in the composition and amount of combustible materials present in our homes. The risk-reducing factors include generally favorable socioeconomic and technological developments, including concrete societal actions directed against fire risks such as the promotion of smoke detectors and sprinkler systems. Fire safety is one of the oldest documented examples of societal risk management. City planning and construction were early influenced by fire safety considerations, while in contrast, the legal responsibility for residential fire safety has largely remained a private and individual matter. The situation is similar to the one that for long prevailed in the traffic sector, that is, the primary responsibility rests with the system’s users, not with its designers. The launch of the Vision Zero on fire safety in 2010 represented a clear boost in ambition. Along with the vision, a strategy intended to guide the work toward the visionary goal was also presented. The strategy included four items: information, technical solutions, local collaboration, and evaluation/research. Several actions were taken in line with the strategy, including a significant research effort and the development of a set of indicators to monitor progress. Ten years later, the research effort has brought new knowledge that puts previous perceptions into partly new light. The notion that survival depends on the individual’s personal capacities is strengthened. Adverse outcomes such as death and serious injury appear mainly linked to specific vulnerabilities of certain groups for medical and social reasons. Most fires are handled by the residents themselves without injuries and without assistance from Rescue Services; on the other hand, even minor fires can be fatal for vulnerable residents. This turns the problem framing toward social aspects rather than technical, since broad groups of residents lack the capacities needed, conflicting with the prevailing view that the individual should bear the primary responsibility. Other findings relate to the proven inefficiency of certain measures for groups at elevated risk and the need for re-thinking and innovations to meet the challenges ahead. This includes extended inter-sectoral collaboration on a broader spectrum of residential risks besides fire, threatening the same groups for similar social and medical reasons. This updated state of knowledge is now being used as a basis for renewing current national fire safety strategies. With reference to general principles of systems control, this chapter will discuss obstacles and challenges to establish a more robust and systematic national control of the fire problem in line with the Vision Zero policy. The appropriateness of launching Vision Zero policies in fields that are not yet ripe for systematic governance is also discussed. It is concluded that a Vision Zero initiative can still be meaningful and successfully pursued, provided that limitations in the ability to influence crucial elements in the system are openly identified and systematically addressed in a process in which strategical and policy developments interact with research and innovation.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

In view of these concerns, an Android-based mobile application is designed and developed to facilitate the food ordering process in the school canteen with food allergy alert feature. This can ease a class teacher’s workload and helps the school authorities to manage the school canteen especially during the recess time. It also provides a communication channel between the school canteen caterer and parents for food ordering and allergy-causing food information.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

However, there is inherent complexity in the development of VBI models which must account for multibody dynamics of vehicles, structural dynamics of bridges, and vehicle-bridge contact relationships. Within the literature, three distinct frameworks exist for handling the model complexity of VBI: (1) hard coding the equations of motion of the vehicles and bridges while numerically coupling them in an arbitrary programming language; (2) developing a co-simulation that leverages a commercial finite element (FE) software to model the bridge and separately solve for the equations of motion of a vehicle; or (3) develop high-fidelity representations of both the bridge and vehicle through a commercial FE environment alone. While these unique frameworks offer accurate and reliable results, there exists a trade-off between frameworks that require sophisticated coding of the user but result in high computational speed (1 and 2) and frameworks with simple implementation but longer computation times (3). The present study attempts to bridge this gap and formulate a computationally efficient framework for implementing VBI modeling into a commercial FE software (Abaqus). This requires minimal coding by the user and could then be used by both the industrial and the research community. A VBI model of a passenger vehicle traveling across a bridge is modeled using the bicycle model concept and Euler beam element formulations within Abaqus. Robust node-to-surface contact algorithms within Abaqus are implemented to couple the vehicle to the bridge during the analysis. The dynamic responses of both the vehicle and bridge are verified with data from the literature. The study primarily follows a 2D scheme but concludes with a discussion of how these methods can be extended to a 3D scheme.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Solid Construction', 'Complexity', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Structural Materials']"

If the goal of reaching net zero by mid-century is to be achieved, global climate change must be urgently addressed, and the 50% benchmark of the phased reduction in emissions must be reached by the year 2030. Reducing carbon emissions in the operational sector of buildings remains an urgent priority. In addition, the production of most building construction materials remains carbon-intensive. Without quantifying and considering the embodied energy of the materials in our buildings, a significant obstacle continues to block the path of achieving net-zero emissions in the building sector. Aluminum and glass, both predominant materials in the building skin, have high embodied energy. It is imperative that buildings that achieve a net-zero status do so while ensuring that ALL sources of emissions, including embodied carbon, be taken into consideration. This study seeks to elucidate the definition of net-zero buildings to address these issues and to advance the knowledge of this category of buildings by addressing the impact and role of envelope materials and systems in reducing carbon footprint.","['Energy', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management']"

Traditional masculinity is considered as the negative and socially aversive traits and behaviors related to idealized societal masculine norms and is characterized by instrumental personality traits such as aggression. The aim of this narrative revision is to discuss the role of traditional and hegemonic masculinity in aggression and violence. According to the studies analyzed, it has been possible to demonstrate that traditional masculinity relates to aggression and violence in its different subtypes. Therefore, we can state that assuming traditional masculinity would be a transversal risk factor to perpetrate any type of violence. Therefore, it is a priority to support positive, egalitarian, and healthy masculinities. These results can promote relevant interventions to facilitate healthy relationships and to prevent violence in different contexts.","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Emotion', 'Personality and Social Psychology']"

The skin and the stiffeners were fabricated out of unidirectional carbon fibre prepreg (CYCOM G40-800/5276-1) from Cytec and were bonded with AF163-2K structural film adhesive from 3M. The path chosen for the fibre installation was designed to provide strain response for comparison with the strain gauges, as well as to witness any change in the strain due to disbonding between the stiffener and the skin. The component was quasi-statically loaded until the skin-stiffener joint fully disbonded. The fibre optic sensor was able to detect and track the damage growth during quasi-static testing by monitoring variations in the strain distribution at the skin and stiffener interface. Results from the fibre optic sensor corroborated well with the inspection carried out using flash thermography.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

The war had displaced missions of people and concentrated them into camps for internally-displaced people. This put immense strain on the local availability of woody biomass used for cooking. Women are primarily responsible for collecting fuelwood, and it was estimated that a 7-hour round trip was necessary to collect sufficient firewood for 2 or 3 days, causing great physical hardship to the women and exposing them to extreme risk of sexual violence as they ventured outside the safety of the camps. The Berkeley-Darfur Stove had been demonstrated to reduce fuel use by roughly 50%. However, recall error and social-desirability bias makes evaluating stove use through surveys challenging. This case study chronicles the integration of low-cost temperature sensors into the Berkeley-Darfur Stove to measure actual use (in contrast to self-reported use), as well as the challenges associated with conducting fieldwork and processing large datasets. Based on this work, it was determined that at least 75% of the women who received the Berkeley-Darfur Stove for free actually adopted it for routine use. Additionally, it was (serendipitously) found that just the act of conducting follow-up surveys had a significant positive impact on adoption. In-person surveys were also conducted, and no correlation was found between the stated use frequency of the cookstoves and the measured use frequency (as determined by the sensors), likely due to the social-desirability bias. This work has launched a variety of ventures including the development of data processing software, improved sensor design, and—most recently—the founding of Geocene, a company focused on expanding the application of remote sensors and providing consulting for companies building Internet of Things (IoT) products.","['Environment', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Development Economics', 'Development and Sustainability', 'Engineering Design', 'Social/Human Development Studies']"

The fault in gearbox leads to breakdown of the machinery. Early detection of fault in worm gearbox can prompt for economical preventive maintenance which ultimately prevents the breakdown and the production losses. Classification of the fault of worm gear is the first step of ensuring the gearbox protection. In this paper, a robust classification scheme based on autoregression minimum entropy deconvolution (AR-MED) and dendrogram support vector machine (DSVM) has been proposed to classify the faults of worm gearbox. AR-MED filter is used to remove the regular pattern of the gear and enhance the periodic impulsiveness in the signal. Features have been extracted from the filtered signal and used as input in DSVM model for multiclass classification of the fault conditions of worm gearbox. Results reveal that effectiveness of classification of DSVM has been enhanced using AR-MED filter with 100% decoding accuracy.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics']"

Excessive static or high-cyclic loading or seismic excitation can lead to large localised strains and cracking. It is therefore essential to monitor the response of masonry structures to external loading, especially in the case of historic buildings and infrastructure. The present work aims at designing novel smart intervention materials for multifunctional application in historic masonry structures as a means of SHM, simultaneously structurally and chemically compatible with the in-situ material. The materials investigated consist of lime mortars mixed with different conductive micro- and nanofillers dispersed in the binder. Smartness stems from the materials’ enhanced piezoresistivity, namely the constitutive relation between strain and electrical resistivity. Through application as a repointing agent in existing structures, these materials can be used as deformation and damage sensors. Electromechanical testing employing cyclic compression was conducted on mortars with different doping levels of three conductive fillers: graphite powder, carbon nanotubes and carbon microfibres. The electromechanical study involved the determination of the piezoresistive gauge factors of the different mixes for determining the optimal doping level for each employed filler.

This paper proposes a baseline-free damage imaging algorithm based on a combination of virtual time reversal (VTR) and the Reconstruction Algorithm for Probabilistic Inspection of Damage (RAPID) tomographic technique. VTR is an alternative to traditional time reversal as it reduces the burden of physically back-propagating re-mitted signals by applying signal operations between the transmitted and received waveforms. Spatial VTR-based damage indices were here proposed to enhance defect detection as they do not require the time domain reconstruction of re-emitted signals. Experimental results on damaged aluminium and composite specimens showed that the proposed VTR-based damage indices coupled to the RAPID imaging algorithm were able to localise material flaws with a maximum localisation error of ~6 mm and ~2 mm for aluminium and composite samples, respectively.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

For the monitoring, diagnosing, and predicting purposes of the aircraft health in recent decades, the list of parameters recorded aboard has been continuously expanding. Great prospects in this direction are associated with the creation and implementation of so-called smart materials that can control their health and even actively resist damage. The article presents the results of research aimed at establishing diagnostic features for wire made of aluminum alloy 1417M that can be easily measured during aircraft operation and are uniquely related to its health. This wire is promising for on-board cable network due to its 30% less weight than copper wire. The article investigates the effect of twisting on the mechanical properties characteristics (conventional yield stress, tensile strength, percentage elongation) and the values of the resistivity of the alloy wire 1417M. The dependences of mechanical characteristics and resistivity on the number of twists were obtained. It has been established that the nature of the dependences obtained is influenced by the diameter of the tested wire. Correlation between resistivity and stress-related properties of alloy is established. The obtained regression equation makes it possible to analyze the voltage change patterns as a function of the strain value by changing the value of the resistivity values during loading of the wire from aluminum alloy 1417M. Therefore, it can be the basis for monitoring, diagnostics, and prediction of the aircraft cable network health.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Control and Systems Theory']"

Future climate change scenarios predict an increase in wildfire activity such as increases in fire extent, severity or frequency in many ecosystems. Fuel management is the primary means for land and fire managers to reduce the risk from future fires. There are multiple fuel management strategies used, with varying levels of effectiveness. In this chapter, we discuss mitigation strategies for wildfire in the context of fuel management, with a primary focus on reducing the impacts to people and property. We consider a range of different fuel management strategies, including prescribed fire, mechanical treatments, grazing and landscaping. We provide an overview of the known evidence-base for the efficacy of each strategy in terms of their influence on three key elements of wildfire risk: the likelihood of ignition; spread to the Wildland-Urban Interface, and impacts at the Wildland-Urban Interface. Finally, we discuss fire risk mitigation strategies under a changing climate. No single solution will achieve all stated objectives alone. Fire managers need to consider where and when it is appropriate to apply the various fuel management actions in order to achieve the greatest risk reduction across a range of values. They also need to consider whether the risk reduction benefit is outweighed by the harm it may do to human health or to environmental values.","['Engineering', 'Fire Science, Hazard Control, Building Safety', 'Environmental Health', 'Climate Change/Climate Change Impacts']"

A network of more than 240 sensors, most of them based on fiber-optic technology, has been installed to follow movements, vibrations and operating conditions of the bridge deck and piles in real-time. First of all, the monitoring solution aims to keep under control the loads and deformations of the structure, for verifying that its behavior lies within the boundaries of the project design. Both the bridge displacement and strain (due to the temperature changes and the passage of vehicles) and the piles’ tilt are recorded and analyzed to relate the actual behavior of the structure. In addition, several accelerometers are distributed along the bridge deck to check the bridge vibrations with Operational Modal Analysis (OMA). OMA allows to reconstruct the real structural dynamic behavior in real-time and compare it to the project design one, depending on the boundary conditions. At the same time, a database on both the structure behavior and the surrounding conditions is being built for properly and efficiently planning maintenance activities in the medium and long term. In summary, the fiber-optic structural monitoring system is the solution chosen by the owner for both efficiently operate the infrastructure and assuring the safety of people over many decades.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The coronavirus causes respiratory problems and also gets affected in many parts of the human body. This virus is transmitted from one body to another body through the air or by touch. The only way to stop the transmission is to use a mask on the face and washing or sanitizing hands frequently. Sanitizers are liquid, gel, or foam which is designed to eliminate germs on skin or any other object. In daily lives also sanitization is necessary to prevent various germs which can make you ill. One of the main modes of contact with germs is our hands because in our daily lives we touch many infected surfaces and objects unknowingly hence to prevent any type of illness due to those germs, hand sanitization is necessary, especially for a person working in a closed and congested environment like offices, canteens, restaurants, schools, etc. This paper aims to design a low-cost Arduino-based automatic sanitizer dispenser-controlled door and it will be of great help in public places where people don’t follow hand hygiene properly. This automatic sanitizer system will be placed at the entry point of the main gate and it will only allow entry from that gate if and only if the person goes through the sanitization process first.","['Engineering', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Energy Systems']"

One objective is to avoid direct mechanical irritation or insult to neural elements using spontaneous and triggered electromyography (EMG) to detect proximity of surgical instruments and implants. While an 8-mA threshold for pedicle screw testing remains the most prudent alert criterion, it should be adjusted based on patient factors such as bone porosity. A second objective is to alert the surgeon to possible evolving dysfunction. EMG and somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEPs) have historically shown relatively weak sensitivity in diagnosing spinal nerve root dysfunction during surgery, while motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) have demonstrated excellent accuracy when appropriate alert criteria and optimized anesthetic regimens are utilized.

Women having PCOS problem are associated with serious consequences of health issues such as heart disease, obesity, infertility, ovarian cancer, type 2 diabetes and so on. To prevent the risks associated with PCOS, there is a need to develop prediction models for the accurate identification of PCOS at early stage. This chapter aims in developing prediction model based on ELM (Extreme learning machine) and Bayesian optimization algorithm for the detection of PCOS at early stage. The class imbalance problem has been overcome using a strategy known as random oversampling. In this approach, Bayesian optimization is employed to choose the best hyperparameters of the models. The proposed architecture has been evaluated using PCOS dataset obtained from Kaggle. Further, the efficacy of the proposed ELM and Bayesian optimization algorithm has been compared with SVM, MLP, ELM and ELM and Genetic algorithm. The experimental results reveal that ELM and Bayesian optimization attained better performance of 99.31% accuracy when compared with other machine learning approaches.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Health Informatics']"

Based on the simulation, which investigated the effect of 3 m 2 of implemented plants in an office space with a total air volume of 74.7 m 3 , it was calculated that the plants have the potential to maintain benzene, toluene, octane and trichlorethylene concentrations and can replace part of the ventilated air. In the first state, the implemented greening was able to significantly reduce the requirement for the amount of ventilated air in the range of 96–100% because the implemented greenery is able to assimilate a similar amount of VOC as the expected imitation. In the second case, when the immediate reduction of the concentration to the level of 10% of the original value was required, the implemented greening did not significantly affect the amount of ventilated air, only in the range of 0.02–0.64%. However, when the required concentration corresponding to 10% of the initial value was reached, the plants again significantly reduced the requirement for ventilated air in the next 7 h of simulation, when they were able to assimilate similar amounts of VOC, octane, toluene and trichlorethylene exceeding the actual emission. Based on the simulation, the assumption was confirmed that the implementation of plants in the indoor environment can bring savings in the field of building ventilation, especially in the longer term, not with a short impact requirement for an immediate reduction in concentration. Based on the achieved results, it is appropriate to recommend the implementation of plants in the indoor environment for permanently reduction of the VOCs concentration.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Computational Intelligence']"

The landfill is rather similar to anaerobic digesters and creates an anoxic environment where soil derived set of microorganisms contribute enzymes toward the degradation of initial carbon-rich substrates of municipal solid wastes (MSWs). The subsequent metabolites at different stages of digestion from the degradation processes culminate into a gas mixture of methane and carbon dioxide as the end product. While developing a landfill gas-to-energy project, the following should be considered: costs, environmental impact, and social aspects throughout the different developmental phases. Each stage of the project, from gas extraction through processing to utilization, has its specific key considerations that contribute to the overall sustainability of recovering energy from landfills. Landfill gas generation projections are usually inaccurate and tend to affect feasibility studies. This should not be viewed as a deterrent for currently existing landfill sites, as uncaptured gases escape and pollute the atmosphere while extracted but unused (excess) gas is flared at a cost to the environment. Additionally, landfill leachates pollute groundwater but can also be helpful in circulating nutrients and microorganisms in the landfill to improve gas production. Although, a number of considerations along the landfill gas-to-energy value chain can improve the project’s sustainability, it may be more sustainable to desist from managing solid municipal waste by landfilling in the long run. It is rather recommended to sort the municipal solid waste and digest only the degradable organics in anaerobic digesters. Other components of the municipal waste can then be managed using other approaches that primarily target recycling and controlled pyrolysis. Bioprospecting for microorganisms adapted to landfill conditions for later use in anaerobic digesters treating the degradable fractions of municipal solid wastes is worth exploring in future. To improve the sustainability of landfill gas-to-energy projects, some of the key considerations to be factored by Operators and Developers are discussed in this chapter.","['Life Sciences', 'Microbial Ecology', 'Microbiology', 'Environment, general', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology', 'Sustainable Development']"

Managing both often requires different strategies, and can be pursued without consideration of the interface between the natural and technological worlds. However, as society has looked to minimizing the impact on the natural world by implementing sustainability strategies, and more recently has recognized the need to make human settlements resilient as well as sustainable, the need to create sustainable and resilient human development has emerged. When one further considers the interrelationships between carbon emissions, climate change and climate impacts, this need becomes imminent. While this is true for many hazards, fire is a particular hazard of concern, since fire as a natural hazard is being increased in frequency and intensity by changes in climate that are increasing drought conditions and high temperatures, and fire as a technological hazard can be inadvertently increased by implementation of energy sustainability measures, such as localized energy sources (e.g., photovoltaics) creating potential ignition hazards, and thermal insulation (specifically combustible materials) creating additional fuel load. In order to most comprehensively address and mitigate the increasing fire risk is to adopt the concepts of a Sustainable And Fire Resilient Built Environment (SAFR-BE), where the built environment includes buildings (structures, facilities), infrastructure and communities. This chapter introduces the concept of SAFR-BE and how such holistic thinking can be applied to reduce environmental and other impacts of fire.","['Engineering', 'Fire Science, Hazard Control, Building Safety', 'Environmental Health', 'Climate Change/Climate Change Impacts']"

Agricultural activities are carried out in the delta area due to the availability of water resources. In recent years, river water has been polluted in various ways through human activities and the process of industrialization. Consequently, contamination has an impact on the soil health of agricultural land. As a result, our focus has been on soil health analysis by measuring the chemical properties and heavy metals that exist in the soil. A classification model has been developed to determine the contamination level that exists in the soil through interpolation techniques. Soil samples are analysed in terms of soil chemical properties such as macronutrient, micronutrient, pH, and electric conductivity. Samples are collected at different locations at various depths where the sample size is 33. Samples are taken from the different regions that cover the category of farmland, urban areas, industrial areas, and river beds in the Cauvery delta region. A continuous surface had created for the concentration of the chemical constituents that are present in the soil through the space interpolation techniques using GIS technology which was determined from the analytical classification of the amount of the chemicals or the heavy metals that present in the soil has been determined through the fuzzy logic membership function. The soil contamination analysis based on the GIS approach provides an ongoing basis for monitoring contaminated sites. The contamination level along with to which extent it was contaminated is determined. The classification of the overall soil contamination levels of the Cauvery delta region is provided in detail, and its dispersed outcome is represented as a statistical analysis report in the form of the spatial variation maps.","['Engineering', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Building Materials', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences']"

Moving sensor networks rely on indirect measurements taken from within the vehicle while traveling over the bridge. The signal collected from within a passing vehicle contains the bridge’s structural response, vehicle suspension input, and surface roughness-induced vibrations. This paper investigated the feasibility of drive-by bridge monitoring using numerical and experimental assessments and addressed their challenges using the time-frequency method. The proposed methodology uses Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT), which extracted modal responses and delineated the bridge frequency components from the driving and vehicle frequencies using the wavelet packet coefficients. The performance of the proposed method was validated using both numerical simulations and a laboratory experiment. The effects of vehicle parameters on vehicle acceleration response were studied using analytical modeling. In the laboratory experiment, a moving cart was used as a vehicle traveling over a scaled bridge model. The results demonstrated that the proposed method could efficiently extract and separate the bridge dynamics from the vehicle response.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Solid Construction', 'Complexity', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Structural Materials']"

Unfortunately, patients cannot be supervised by operators 24 h a day, given the associated costs. An attempt to solve this problem is already provided by wearable devices. This paper describes a 4.0 system implemented to overcome the limits (identified by interviewing a sample of nurses belonging to different facilities) of the wearable devices available on the market. The system proposed consists in monitoring the bed, instead of the patient, through applied sensors. By centralizing and analyzing the data collected it is possible to promptly inform the operative center of the occurrence of risky events to which bedridden patients are normally subjected. The scope of the system is preventing such risks, where possible, or mitigating their effects with a real time intervention. A case study on an active facility, conducted as a pilot project, confirms the humanitarian and economic benefits for patients and facility.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Machine Learning', 'Robotics and Automation']"

Individuals suffering from SAUD are often tough to be more aggressive and violent. We reviewed the literature linking alcohol consumption and aggression to provide a synthesis of available evidence on this topic. In general, both acute alcohol consumption and SAUD are associated with an increase in the three subcomponents of aggression, namely, anger, hostility, and aggressive behaviors. We identified several mechanisms involved in the elicitation of aggression in SAUD, including hostility biases and the lack of emotional or cognitive control. Finally, we proposed treatments that specifically target these processes.","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Emotion', 'Personality and Social Psychology']"

To better understand the factors that foster or hinder people’s interaction with a particular technology, acceptance models such as TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) or the UTAUT (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) are commonly used. However, in the case of humanoid social and service robotics these models may have some drawbacks, as the acceptance towards such robots not only depends on their functions and capabilities but on their shape and movement capability. For that reason, if acceptance models are intended to be used for robot evaluation, it is necessary to adequately design and pilot them in order to have well tested evaluation tools prior to hands-on technology assessment. With that aim, this work presents a pilot study which has been carried out with a group of elderly students at the university of the third age - Programa de la Experiencia of the Universidad Pontificia de Salamanca. The goal is to select the most suitable tools found in the literature to assess the acceptance of a companion robot for the elderly, which is currently under development, and to test the suitability of these tools before conducting experiments with the real robotic platform.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The early detection of pneumonia is important to prevent this intolerable death. Basically, images from chest x-ray can be used to detect pneumonia. However, it is a very challenging task for an expert radiologist to detect the disease accurately. The condition can be complicated due to the deficiency of medical equipment and workforce. Therefore, only the radiologist can hamper the treatment process because it needs a human expertise, effort, and time. In such a situation, It is necessary to use a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system that can identify pneumonia from datasets automatically and more accurately. In this work, an enhanced deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks is proposed for the radiologist to make their decision. It is an unsupervised algorithm that allows you to extract features automatically that are more useful for classification. For balancing datasets partial data augmentation technique is applied. The CNN based models including AlexNet, ResNet34, VGG16 and SqueezeNet1_0 are trained with our own dataset and their results are evaluated using a confusion matrix. Finally the results of the improved CNN model are compared with the results of the pre-trained models. The experiment shows that the improved CNN model performs better based on accuracy compared to all other pre-trained models.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The knowledge of the actual loads encountered by the aircraft and a numerical model able to predict failures allow to warn the aircraft operator that further inspections and eventual maintenance are required. The LMS is based on the data acquired by several sensors, some of them already present on any aircraft (to measure aircraft speed, altitude, load factor, etc.). Additional strain sensors are necessary to monitor the state of stress at certain locations that allow to estimate the actual load condition (e.g. shear, bending, torsion distribution on the aircraft wing box). The proposed LMS is tested with the ground static test of the winglet of a general aviation aircraft and will be applied in-flight to reconstruct the actual load conditions.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Therefore, this research aims to search for an effect of ages contributed on urban road traffic accident for mortality and injuries reduction through Geographic Information System (GIS). The accident data was gathered from three main databases of (the Royal Thai Police (POLIS), Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Public Health (Death Certificate), Road Accident Victims Protection Company Limited (E-Claim)) and input for spatial analysis based on GIS with Kernel density analysis. The results demonstrated that the accident occurred in the primary and secondary road areas at the city center and most of the vulnerable group are young children in an area with a large amount of travel. Although, the area with a high density of activity and traffic volume leads to the number of accidents, the reduction of speed due to the heavy traffic is associated to less mortality rate. However, considering on different age groups, it was found that most of the accidents occurred among young children which represented more than ¼ of total number of fatalities. Future prevention and intervention for this vulnerable group must be holistically emphasized which includes speed enforcement, road safety education, regulation of protective restraints, and creation of transport policies that minimize risk and severity for this particular group.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Arts', 'Building Construction and Design']"

Tests were performed on a healthy volunteer subject sitting at rest and breathing regularly, who used five types of face masks in well-ventilated and poorly ventilated rooms. The ventilation conditions were determined by the natural ventilation of the room. Each of the tests lasted one hour. To estimate the CO 2 level, a sensor based on the Non-dispersive Infrared (NDIR) principle was used. The results revealed that while wearing a face mask, the ventilation conditions affected the CO 2 concentration levels in the naso-buccal area of the user, especially in those that offered a higher level of protection, and in those that best fit the face of the subject. A multiple comparison method (Tukey) revealed significant differences in the levels of CO 2 between all the facemask tested (p < 0.0001). The CO 2 levels were also compared with the exposure limits recommended by NIOSH, showing that the use of N95 for 1 h exceeded the recommended 5,000 ppm for an 8-h workday.

A survey was conducted among different road users in Kerala to study the perceived safety about motorized two-wheeler users. The survey asked individuals to rate the level of risk associated with activities that can cause accidents and their agreement with increasing law enforcements. The survey responses were analysed using structural equation modelling to understand the relationship between risk perception, user’s confidence and law enforcement. The study showed that risk perception and user’s confidence are correlated (−0.51) but not user’s confidence and law enforcement (−0.06). Risk perception positively influences user’s agreement with stricter law enforcement (0.21). There is higher correlation between risk perception and user’s confidence among males (−0.52) than females (−0.31). Both user’s confidence and risk perception influence females’ agreement with higher law enforcement.

Drawing on the feminist scholarship on prostitution and trafficking, I argue that security concerns and feminist neo-abolitionist ideals are inextricably linked in the problematisation of trafficking in women for sexual exploitation that such policies offer, and that such link plays a central role in its securitisation, while significantly altering it. The central element that enables this is the construction of trafficked women as victims rather than threats that feminist neo-abolitionists inside the EU develop, by dis-identifying them from the threatening features of traffickers, irregular immigrants and sex workers along the lines of agency and abuse, using the exact same mechanisms at play in their approach to prostitution: the logics of denial, the metonymic displacement of selling sex into selling oneself and the notion of vulnerability. Yet, in relation to trafficking in women, these become culturalised , fostering gendered forms of cultural essentialism and exclusionary forms of intersectionality that intersect with security to render trafficked victims a risk . This explains why the solutions proposed in the anti-trafficking policies of the EU strengthen security while weakening protection. It also explains the complex process of othering they enact, which is premised on the compulsory assimilation of trafficked victims and attendant exclusion of organised criminals, irregular immigrants and sex workers. And yet, these are nonetheless reconciled with the EU’s alleged commitment to freedom, equality and human rights.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Politics and Gender', 'European Politics', 'International Security Studies']"

The analysis of the socio-psychological and criminological characteristics of drivers accused of committing transport crimes constitutes the purpose of this scientific work. The Author puts forward the working hypothesis that the drivers of road vehicles responsible for traffic accidents have distinctive ideological, subcultural, motivational and characterological (pathocharacterological) shortcomings/problems, as well clear signs of maladaptation and desocialization. The following tools and methods were used in this study—statistical, documentary, experimental psychological methods, sociological methods of questioning and personality analysis. The materials of specific criminal cases on transport crimes, acts of judicial psychiatric, narcological, psychological and technical examinations, as well as the results of surveys and interviews of the drivers themselves (the accused) were used as the empirical basis of this Article. It was concluded that the core pattern of deviant (aggressive, scatterbrained, provocative or criminally motivated) behavior of drivers is a heterogeneous group of personality disorders manifested as a destructive sociopathic complex. The most striking manifestations of such complex include the following—complete disregard for moral norms, low level of culture, emotional-volitional imbalance, hyper aggressiveness, impulsiveness, a tendency to addictive lifestyle, low empathy, and narcissism.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

However, to what extent deposition of fat in these two depots is affected by intermediate variables is unknown. The aim of this work was to conduct a mediation analysis with a view to uncovering the metabolic traits that underlie the relationship between liver fat and intrapancreatic fat deposition (IPFD) and quantifying their effect. Methods All participants underwent MRI/magnetic resonance spectroscopy on the same 3.0 T scanner to determine liver fat and IPFD. IPFD of all participants was quantified manually by two independent raters in duplicate. A total of 16 metabolic traits (representing markers of glucose metabolism, incretins, lipid panel, liver enzymes, pancreatic hormones and their derivatives) were measured in blood. Mediation analysis was conducted, taking into account age, sex, ethnicity and BMI. Significance of mediation was tested by computing bias-corrected bootstrap CIs with 5000 repetitions. Results A total of 353 individuals were studied. Plasma glucose, HDL-cholesterol and triacylglycerol mediated 6.8%, 17.9% and 24.3%, respectively, of the association between liver fat and IPFD. Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, insulin, glucagon, amylin, C-peptide, HbA 1c , glucagon-like peptide-1 and gastric inhibitory peptide did not mediate the association between liver fat and IPFD. Conclusions/interpretation At least one-quarter of the association between liver fat and IPFD is mediated by specific blood biomarkers (triacylglycerol, HDL-cholesterol and glucose), after accounting for potential confounding by age, sex, ethnicity and BMI.

Here, we demonstrate the possibility of inferring the size of a stochastic system by assembling measurements of its response into a detection matrix. In deterministic systems, the rank of the detection matrix (number of non-zero singular values) equals the size of the largest observable system component. We extend this framework to reconstruct the number of states of an unknown Markov chain, where we cannot distinguish between two or more states. In this case, we only have access to an estimate of the detection matrix, but with a larger rank, since stochasticity generates a series of non-zero singular values. We establish conditions for the correct inference of system size, relating the number of realizations and the smallest true singular value. Our work highlights connections between SHM, system identification, and control theory, paving the way for new cross-disciplinary inquiries.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

This paper specifically reviews the active actuation techniques of Lamb waves in the SHM system for diagnostic analysis. It is axiomatic that appropriate signal actuation is of vital necessity and important for a reliable SHM system. Multimodal and dispersive characteristics of the Lamb waves are the main factors for the variety of applied actuation techniques. Multiple Lamb modes synchronously exist, and their dispersive properties are not identical which lead to complex superimposed signals. Various techniques for single mode generation have been proposed to reduce the complexity of the measured signals. Generally, the applied techniques can be clustered to frequency tuning and actuator configuration. The findings showed that the applied techniques were proven to be effective in producing pure mode for further analysis. All these studies have revealed the evolution of Lamb waves-based SHM system for controlling and monitoring the condition of the structure.","['Engineering', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation']"

Methods In a randomised placebo-controlled crossover trial located at the German Diabetes Center, 12 male individuals with type 2 diabetes (age 18–75 years, BMI <35 kg/m 2 , HbA 1c 42–75 mmol/mol [6–9%]), randomly allocated by one person, underwent 2-h HBO, once with 100% (240 kPa; HBO) and once with 21% oxygen (240 kPa; control, CON). Insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic clamps with d -[6,6- 2 H 2 ]glucose, hepatic and skeletal muscle energy metabolism were assessed by 1 H/ 31 P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, while high-resolution respirometry measured skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue (WAT) mitochondrial capacity. All participants and people assessing the outcomes were blinded. Results HBO decreased fasting blood glucose by 19% and increased whole-body, hepatic and WAT insulin sensitivity about one-third ( p <0.05 vs CON). Upon HBO, hepatic γ-ATP concentrations doubled, mitochondrial respiratory control doubled in skeletal muscle and tripled in WAT ( p <0.05 vs CON). HBO increased myocellular insulin-stimulated serine-473/threonine-308 phosphorylation of Akt but decreased basal inhibitory serine-1101 phosphorylation of IRS-1 and endoplasmic reticulum stress ( p <0.05 vs CON). Conclusions/interpretation HBO-mediated improvement of insulin sensitivity likely results from decreased endoplasmic reticulum stress and increased mitochondrial capacity, possibly leading to low-dose reactive oxygen species-mediated mitohormesis in humans with type 2 diabetes.

Under normal operating conditions, Tainter gates should be hoisted in a level fashion throughout the circular path they travel. Uneven hoisting may lead to a redistribution of loads or accelerated fatigue damage, and an instrumentation system was installed on the subject gate with a goal to monitor for such hoisting. Additionally, a numerical model was created to investigate changes in structural response when the gate hoists unevenly. Comparison of the initial data to the model suggested that the gate was regularly hoisting unevenly. To increase confidence in the instrumentation system, and aid in validating the numerical model, short-term monitoring was leveraged wherein the hoisting cables of the gate were instrumented with accelerometers. Then, a frequency domain method was used to infer the tension in each of the cables that hoist the gate, which is expected to be approximately equal if the gate is hoisting evenly. Results from the monitoring program support the notion that the gate is regularly hoisting unevenly, thus increasing confidence in the instrumentation system.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

This topic deserves great attention and interest, assuming that both the self-perception and the recognition of the image of nurses by the community are decisive elements of the image of nurses and nursing care. Aim Evaluate if an observational internship conducted through Team Based Learning (TBL) methodology in blended learning can engage students in nursing research with a focus on nursing social image. Methods We conducted a TBL in blended learning and flipped classroom mode revised in terms of time and delivery mode, with first-year students of the Nursing Bachelor of the University of Milan. Moodle and MS Teams learning management system platforms technologically supported the teaching activity. TBL involves a percentage evaluation based on its 2° and 3° phase and on peer evaluation. Results A total of 33 first-year nursing students participated. The average rating on individual test was 21.9 with a SD = 3.71. On tests in groups, students in all three groups achieved an assessment of 27/30. For Team Application (tAPP) students created a poster about nurses’ social image. The scores that were assigned to the three groups showed high ratings between 26 and 30 thirtieths. Discussion Significant improvements were found in attitudes toward group learning and perceived collective efficacy on teamwork, acquisition of basic nursing research concepts, recognition of one's profession, and the ability to reflect on how to improve the social image.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The crack density is a very well-known damage parameter representing the actual mechanical state of the material in terms of stiffness degradation. In effect, for laminates presenting off-axis laminae, crack density is useful for determining the “characteristic damage state” (CDS) that is related the load carrying capability of the laminate. In present research, a novel procedure is proposed for performing contactless measurements of crack density during static tensile tests by using temperature signal. The results have been critically compared with the strain waves signal acquired by acoustic emission sensors during the same tests. The proposed technique and procedure lead to estimate the crack density in those applications where it is difficult to detect transverse crack using a direct measurement from common experimental techniques.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

This demand is driven by increasing cost effectiveness of these tests by reducing down-time for inspection. This paper aims to evaluate the usefulness of using an audible acoustics camera to detect and locate damage within a relatively large structure under bending load. An acoustic camera is a microphone array of known dimensions, which uses a ‘delay-and-sum’ beamforming numerical model, can detect sources of sound. Under the assumption that damage produces sound, this tool should aid in detecting damage. This method of damage detection was validated against strain gauge, LVDT data, and video recording showing the damage propagation. This paper finds acoustic cameras to have a potential to become a stand-alone detection tool. The authors suggest potential developments to the existing system which could potentially produce a more comprehensive method.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Community health care organizations are obliged to discover, avert and regulate infections in the populace. Precaution techniques manipulate the unfolding of today’s infectious diseases like coronavirus variations to some extent. Identification of modern-day infection in the preliminary stage is very vital to govern its spreading. In this chapter, an easy inferring archetypal is proposed for the forecast of the spreading pattern of today’s infectious illnesses using a swarm learning approach in which every particle is benefited from the other particle’s experience despite available neighbourhood statistics. An evaluation of the features of the anticipated archetypal is received by the use of a Recursive Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm that calls for repetitively fixing a quadratic programming problem. The version is derived from training data which provides insight into the force of the spread of the latest infectious illnesses. The proposed version performs on par with the advanced Bayesian Monte Carlo version. The anticipated approach empirically assesses authorized data provided by the World Health Organization. The computation takes a look at consequences, and displays a better accuracy of the predicted pattern of infection spreading.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Health Informatics']"

Damage detection, classification, and localization is a part of the lower levels of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and is critical for damage diagnosis. SHM is an extremely useful tool for ensuring integrity and safety, detecting the evolution. Early damage detection and understanding of damage creation can avoid situations that can be catastrophic. X-ray tomography is a powerful tool for research as well as damage diagnostics. But high-resolution tomography results in high measuring and computational times up to 10 h for one specimen. The paper presents an early method of accessing the sections of the FML for identifying internal damages using X-ray imaging by optimized and adaptive zooming and scanning using automatic Region-of-Interest extraction with Machine Learning methods. The generated knowledge and the image data collected would further accelerate the development in the field of autonomous SHM of the composite and hybrid structures like fibre metal laminates which would further reduce the safety risks and total time associated with structural integrity assessment.

Starting point is an image sets were measured with two different X-ray CT devices with a static parameter set (set in advance and a-priori) and posing many limitations and issues that make damage diagnostics difficult.

For that reason, real-time monitoring systems are extremely useful to measure strains/displacements and temperature. Most of the currently applied systems use electric sensors, known as strain gauges, but a new monitoring technology has gained popularity in the last decades. Fibre Bragg grating (FBG) is an optical sensor with great potential that has been introduced on monitoring systems. The attempts to include FBG sensors in pavement monitoring have shown that further investigation is needed. Some factors to be studied are the interaction between the sensor and pavement, the use of coatings, the application method, and the influence of external conditions (e.g., temperature). This article presents preliminary laboratory work on FBG optical sensors vs electric sensors as part of the Rev@Construction project that aims to digitalise the construction industry in Portugal. This work will be essential to assure the reliability of FBG sensors before they are installed in a pavement monitoring system for a highway section. Through a series of controlled strain tests in a four-point bending apparatus, it was possible to conclude that the FBG sensors have a better quality signal than electrical strain gauge (SG) sensors. Furthermore, FBG sensors are not affected by magnetic fields, a clear advantage compared to SG sensors. The importance of temperature calibration on FBG sensors was also demonstrated in this work when analysing the data collected.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Statistics, general']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-09719-5_35,en,Surgery in the Peripheral Nervous System,OriginalPaper,"Peripheral nerve monitoring provides diagnostic information that can guide surgical decision-making. An extension of the physical examination, electrodiagnostic evaluation produces valuable information regarding peripheral nerve function. This includes sensory and motor nerve conduction studies, continuous and stimulated electromyography, somatosensory-evoked potentials, and nerve action potential recording. A wide range of peripheral nerve pathologies exist including trauma, tumors, and degenerative conditions which produce nerve compression (e.g., carpal or cubital tunnel syndrome). Electrophysiological assessments either preoperatively or intra-operatively can be crucial in determining nerve integrity and whether degenerative or regenerative nerve processes are in play. Anatomical continuity may be preserved within the nerve; however, internal structure may or may not be preserved. Alterations in internal structure are reflected by neurophysiological changes that occur in the setting of peripheral nerve injury. These changes are heterogeneous in nature and factors such as etiology (trauma, entrapment, tumor, etc.) and severity of damage impact electrodiagnostic findings. Intraoperative monitoring enables mapping and localization of specific areas of injury within a nerve trunk. It also serves to identify those nerve structures that should be preserved. Additionally, the functional integrity of the nerve and extent of spontaneous regeneration can be detected from intraoperative recordings, thus guiding surgical management in real time. Nerve injury from intraoperative manipulation can be detected and thus avoided during nerve repair or nerve sheath tumor resection. Intraoperative recording is a necessary tool in the peripheral nerve surgeon’s armamentarium, providing immediate data that optimize surgical treatment to restore nerve function.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Anesthesiology', 'Neurosurgery', 'Pain Medicine']"

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we observed a major reduction in economic and social activities within the region, leading to changes in roadway traffic and air pollution levels in a variety of ways. Within six weeks of the pandemic-induced lockdowns, freeway traffic volume dropped as low as 50%; however, it has since gradually increased back to pre-pandemic levels. The changes in freeway traffic volume have not been uniform across the Southern California region, and neighborhoods with different socio-economic profiles were affected differently. These disparities have brought up environmental justice concerns, particularly for disadvantaged communities that live adjacent to major roadways and warehouse centers. We monitored the changes in vehicle and human activities across communities in Southern California and explored correlations that are useful for developing various mitigation measures at both the local and regional levels. In this study, we go beyond regional analysis and examine the effects of the pandemic on traffic at a transportation corridor and local levels to examine possible equity issues. Results show that, in general, the level of traffic dropped less in disadvantaged neighborhoods during the pandemic. Further, traffic flow rebounded in these neighborhoods faster than in other communities.","['Engineering', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Urban Studies/Sociology', 'Public Policy', 'Cities, Countries, Regions', 'Epidemiology']"

Taking divergent series as convergent (and heterogeneities as homogeneous) marks an illusionary communication, not a real one. The real and non-reductive communication, which Deleuze sometimes calls resonance , entails an element of forced movement, an element that takes several names in the course of Logic of Sense : paradoxical element, aleatory point, object=x, nomadic instance, esoteric word, etc. This element is not determined by an external agent, but it randomly determines itself and produces experimental and contingent determinations. This brings about a new idea of freedom and chance. Everything is determined by a paradoxical element or an aleatory instance. Everything gains its sense from nonsense. Introducing events as submitted to fatality is an attempt to find a third way between determinism and freedom, and this would be possible only through seeking a connection between nature and human being by the introduction of this nomadic movement as a common source that motivates their movements. What connects external nature and human nature is neither determinism nor freedom, but this third realm of fatal events. We are not determined, neither by an external divine force, nor an internal self-consciousness. We are determined by a mad aleatory determinator. And the same is the case about the rest of nature. It is in this sense that, in the course of Logic of Sense , one can ascribe a naturalism to Deleuze, a kind of transcendental naturalism that connects human nature and nature as the great outdoors. At the point of this transcendental naturalism, sense finds its nonsensical element and its logic joins its ontology. At this point, what is free in nature (free matter) joins the feeling of freedom in a consciousness and turns it to unconscious.","['Philosophy', 'Ontology', 'Logic']"

Aside from drinking water, rice consumption is the principal route for As to enter the body. Due to the large population density in Asian countries, such as India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and China, the problem requires more serious attention. The importance of studying the dynamics of the metalloid in the soil-plant system, as well as the rice plant's inherent ability to uptake, transport, and accumulate As in edible grains, necessitates a concentrated research effort. Several factors influence the chemistry of the metalloid, its occurrence, chemical species, and so on, in its natural environment, in soil. In rice, many transporters allow the contaminant to pass from the root to the shoot, and then the xylem and phloem mediate the As uptake in the grain. When irrigation water has elevated As levels, the high irrigation need of rice contributes to soil As build-up, hence a mitigation strategy should include both the sources (soil and irrigation water). The main goal of this chapter is to trace the As pathway in the soil-plant (rice) system, provide an overview of the status of As accumulation in rice grain, and consider possible mitigation strategies, such as modelling approaches for predicting the dietary risk associated with As consumption. A special emphasis is given to the soil-based calculative models and machine learning methodologies, that simulate the uptake of the metalloid in edible grains.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Earth Sciences, general', 'Geography, general']"

There are many studies on fall detection, with the goal of ever-increasing the accuracy, flexibility, and feasibility of implementation in real life. In the last 5 years, the release of many highly-accurate, real-time, open-source pose estimation models offers a unique opportunity to develop effective and easy-to-deploy fall detection systems. In this study, we build two threshold-based fall detection algorithms respectively using the OpenPose and MoveNet pose estimation model. We evaluate the algorithms on two public datasets, namely UR Fall Detection and Charfi2012 dataset. The algorithm using OpenPose achieves an accuracy rate of 68.04% and the one using MoveNet 70.79%. We discuss the benefits of using pose estimation models in detecting falls, as well as the limitations of threshold-based algorithms, and suggest future research directions.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

With the growing concern about the potential exposure to the coronavirus, people are spending more time in their homes while changing their waste generation behaviors. This phenomenon has changed not only how people produce waste but also how MSWMSs plan and adapt the operation of their facilities. Since solid waste management has been declared as an essential service in addition to public health, MSWMSs have faced new challenges and thus developed adaptive measures in order to keep their critical operations. This study (i) identifies a broad range of waste management and operational challenges and (ii) summarizes various adaptive measures taken by different MSWMSs. Ephemeral data were collected and analyzed on the longitudinal impact of the pandemic on multiple MSWMSs in severely affected U.S. states, such as Florida, California, and New York, over a nine-month period. Note that best management practices for such waste-related challenges and adaptive measures can vary across different MSWMSs and states. In order to facilitate the development of different MSWMSs’ plan for future pandemic events, this study will characterize the identified impact of the pandemic and its relevant adaptive measures in terms of system structure (i.e., what facilities exist [entity], how they interact with one another [interdependency], and who control which facilities [control]).","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

However, there still remains some challenges for drones to collect image data of underground structures, primarily due to low light and no GPS conditions. In order to facilitate data acquisition, this article developed a mobile software development kit (MSDK) for drone using visual positioning and predefined controlling code, which enabled the drone to automatically fly along a designated sinusoidal route, whilst continuously taking videos and images of the tunnel surface. The developed MSDK was able to adjust the drone parameters (e.g., overlapping rate, inspection range, heading, flight direction between frames of the video) for different underground infrastructure conditions. Furthermore, a field test is conducted in an abandoned windless tunnel near Cork (Goggins Hill Tunnel) to test its feasibility. Results show that the 40-m difference between the designated routine and actual routine was 1.9%, and the collected data processed by Pix4Dmapper could reconstruct the complete tunnel scene and surface details. The navigation method proposed in this paper allows UAVs to perform automatic inspection without GPS, and the collected image data is used to build a tunnel panorama view.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Both Acoustic Emission-based approaches (passive, active) are limited by the propagation characteristics of ultrasonic waves, especially in inhomogeneous materials like carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP). The use of the piezoelectric and inverse piezoelectric effect is a very accurate method of sensing and exciting ultrasonic waves. However, the transducers resonance characteristics affect the waveforms. For illustration in this contribution different excitation signals are experimentally compared in frequency domain by fast Fourier transform (FFT) and in time-frequency domain by continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Then transducers effects along the propagation path of the wave are investigated. Frequency and fiber direction dependent damping factors of ultrasonic waves in CFRP as well as the influence of the transducers are determined. The distance between sensors in a sensor network is limited by attenuation, so fiber direction must be considered. Finally, by analyzing the frequency response of the transducer, a filtering method is developed to compensate for the resonance characteristics of the transducers. Finally, a more accurate estimate of the energy released and therefore a more accurate estimate of the severity of damages/failures is proposed.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Just like in many Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries, the South African informal sector has many challenges such as lack of organisation, poor regulation, poor service delivery, low capitalisation, and low productivity to contend with. Attempts have been made to address some of these challenges through the application of ICT. One of the proposed solutions is the use of electronic web portal technology to promote informal businesses and facilitate informal business transactions. However, to attain maximum impact, the platform must be enabled with artificial intelligence (AI) to create a system that can leverage the convergence of intelligent reasoning and semantic technology in tackling the challenges of the South African informal sector. In essence, such a web portal must possess capabilities such as semantic-based reasoning, semantic analysis of user queries, and intelligent recommendations, which require the existence of a dedicated domain ontology.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-11701-5_18,en,Assisted Reproductive Technology,OriginalPaper,"The human species is biologically distinguished by low fertility. In fact, with each menstrual cycle, a couple at the peak of their reproductive capacity has only about a 30% chance of conceiving. The WHO states infertility as “ a disease of the reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected intercourse. ” Assisted reproductive technology ( ART) consists of all treatments or procedures that include the in vitro handling of both human oocytes and sperm or of embryos, for the purpose of establishing a pregnancy. The techniques are usually divided into three broad categories: First level techniques: Intrauterine and Intracervical Insemination (IUI/ICI) , the simpler and less invasive ones, such as intrauterine insemination (IUI) with or without Intracervical Insemination (ICI) ovarian stimulation. Second level techniques: the more complex and more invasive ones that can be performed under local anesthesia or deep sedation, which differ from the basic techniques as they involve manipulation of female and male gametes and because they require in vitro fertilization. Among these techniques the IVF (In Vitro Fertilization and Embryo Transfer), ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection), and the possible cryopreservation of male and female gametes and embryos. Third level techniques procedures that require general anesthesia with intubation, including: laparoscopic egg retrieval, intra-tubal transfer of male and female gametes (GIFT), zygotes (ZIFT) and /or embryos (TET) laparoscopically; microsurgical sampling of gametes from the testicle: Testicular Sperm Extraction (TESE), Microsurgical Testicular Sperm Extraction (microTESE), Testicular Sperm Aspiration (TESA); microsurgical sampling of gametes from the epididymides: Percutaneous Epididymal Sperm Aspiration (PESA) and Microsurgical Epididymal Sperm Aspiration (MESA). In all assisted reproduction techniques, the seminal fluid receives a treatment able to induce capacitation “in vitro” so that the activated spermatozoa, at the threshold of the acrosomal reaction, can interact with the mature oocytes. Preimplantation Genetic Screening (PGS) and Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) are highly specialized procedures which involve removing three to four cells from a 5–6 day old blastocyst and testing them for chromosomal abnormalities prior to transferring the embryo into a woman’s uterus. According to data reported from the European IVF-Monitoring Consortium (EIM) for the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE), the clinical pregnancy rates (PR) per aspiration and per transfer are 28.0% and 34.8%, respectively. After ICSI, the corresponding rates are 24% and 33.5%. ART can alleviate the burden of infertility on individuals and families, but it can also present challenges to public health as evidenced by the high rates of multiple delivery, preterm delivery, and low birth-weight delivery experienced with ART.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Urology', 'Reproductive Medicine', 'Endocrinology']"

What About 360° Videos?,OriginalPaper,"Nursing simulation is a teaching method that supports and integrates student learning, along with clinical training and formal teaching without overlapping or replacing them. Virtual reality (VR) is one of the most recent technologies applied to nursing simulation. The added value of VR consists precisely in the immersion and in the sense of presence (the feeling of being there) that it can generate, allowing people to learn from the experience they are living as if it were happening in real life. The 360° video is a type of VR used in many sectors and increasingly in the healthcare one. The peculiarity of this experience is that the environments are not virtually reconstructed by a computer but they are real images and sounds previously recorded by a video camera. Therefore, the 360° video has great potential especially in nursing training and simulation. The aim of this study was to conduct a scoping review on the 360° video applied to nursing education and how this experience was evaluated. A comprehensive electronic search of five electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Scopus) was conducted from their inception to December 2021. Five studies met the inclusion criteria and were considered in this review. These studies encourage the use of this VR technology, but further research is necessary to explore the advantages of the 360° video as learning method in nursing education and to better understand how to evaluate this immersive experience in order to guarantee the effectiveness in terms of learning outcomes.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

One concept to push Digital Twins into practice is the so-called Experimentable Digital Twin (EDT), which allows interaction between Digital Twins in a pure virtual or in a hybrid environment. We expect EDTs to generate additional values for structures and thus, provide an incentive for a more wide-spread use of SHM as the link between digital and real twin. An application, where EDTs generate extra value, is the use for fatigue problems of structures. By predicting the life fraction costs of their physical twins, EDTs allow to compare different process options in a virtual experiment. This is particularly useful if there are multiple options for the same mission. As an example, a crane trolley on a cantilever beam is inspected. The EDT is equipped with a plugin for cyclic counting for variable amplitude loading, which illustrates that basic analytical methods enable the EDT to give a quick estimation of life fraction costs.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-07254-3_51,en,Model-Based Remote Health Monitoring of Ballast Conditions in Railway Crossing Panels,OriginalPaper,"Railway crossing panels accumulate damage due to impact loads induced in the wheel transition area. To reduce the need for labour-intensive visual inspections of crossing panels, railway administrations are evaluating solutions for remote health monitoring. One such solution is to measure the track response that follow from the wheel–crossing impact using embedded accelerometers mounted on the sleeper at the crossing transition. The challenge that remains is to determine the health of the asset from these measured signals. In this paper, a procedure is developed to identify the ballast condition under a crossing panel via the calibration of a multibody simulation model to measurement data. This model considers the complex wheel–rail interaction in the crossing transition area, while also capturing the dynamic response of the track using a Finite Element representation of the track structure. The calibration procedure has been developed using data from six in situ crossing panels where the crossing geometry and the track response are known via laser-scanned crossing geometries and measured accelerations. Parameters associated with the physical state of the ballast are identified by minimizing the least-squares discrepancy between the measured track response and the corresponding response from simulations of dynamic vehicle–track interaction. The utilised ballast parameterization has been motivated from sensitivity analysis to ensure that each parameter has a clear and observable influence on the track response. The performance of the developed calibration procedure is demonstrated and its suitability for implementation in condition monitoring solutions is discussed.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Aim of this work is the feasibility analysis of active thermography for non-destructive detection and quantification of corrosion in steel sheets. In particular, the present work aims at developing a data processing technique for thermal results obtained on steel sound and corroder sheets by means of a laser thermal investigation. Both pulsed and lock in active thermography techniques are explored, in transmission configuration. The influence of excitation parameters on damage detection and quantification performance was also investigated. To this aim different samples of specimens were obtained with increasing corrosion damage, by means of keeping the specimens in a saline cell for increasing time intervals. For all the investigations, the reference signal consisted in the sound sheet thermal response. Data processing allowed to relate frequency and time parameters of the thermal response to the corrosion level. The entity of corrosion was also compared to the thickness specimen variation obtained by means of a metallographic optical microscope.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

One application of HNSW is to measure intraocular pressure (IOP). This is accomplished with HNSW transducers designed using a chain of particles stacked in Hertzian contact. In consideration of the anatomy of the human eye, the particles and transducer are scaled down in size compared to those used in previous designs. With the end goal of a designing a small, mobile transducer, all electronic components need to be compact, and battery powered. The transducer design also needs to trigger and measure the HNSWs. To accomplish this, a particle chain containing ferromagnetic particles surrounded by an applied magnetic field is utilized. To start the wave, a striker particle is lifted and dropped by a solenoid. Controlling the solenoid is the first step in ensuring consistent HNSW waves which requires a driver to control the mechanism. Once triggered, HNSW travel through the particles causing a distortion in the magnetic field that is measured by an inductor coil. This paper will present the design of a new compact HNSW transducer and an experimental evaluation of the solenoid drivers and their current consumption.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

In AE, time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation is considered a key parameter for the accurate localization of a growing defect. This paper describes an entropy-based filtering approach for the ToA estimation of noisy signals and compares its performance to that of the commonly adopted Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The proposed method consists in coarsening the input data using the Crutchfield-Packard algorithm and calculating the local (instantaneous) entropy. In the present study, we demonstrate that the local entropy of the background noise component differs from the useful (informative) signal. As a result, the approach permits filtering the noise component by selecting a proper threshold value. The proposed method has been tested on experimental data aimed at localizing a source of AE in a square $$1 \times 1$$ 1 × 1  m aluminum plate.

As they become mainstream climate mitigation and adaptation options, their capacity to deliver expected benefits, especially when contemplating equity and justice, is at least uncertain. Through a critical review of existing debates and perspectives on NBS, this paper questions their uptake and points at the frequent embeddedness of NBS in speculative and elite-based development paths in both urban and rural areas. We present an alternative, justice-oriented approach to NBS so that projects can avoid nature-enable dispossession and instead build nature-inspired justice that prioritizes the needs, identities, and livelihoods of the most ecologically and socially vulnerable residents.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Physical Geography', 'Environmental Management', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

The incidence of obesity does not solely depend on dietary habits, with energy balance being regulated by the complex interactions between genetic, behavioural and environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have demonstrated that several genes are linked to obesity, and these findings shed light on a growing number of novel potential therapeutics for weight management, including genome editing. In this regard, the cutting-edge technology known as clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas), thanks to its ability to edit DNA or modulate gene expression in eukaryotic cells, undoubtedly enables to understand the genetic mechanisms implicated in obesity and could be a promising tool for its treatment. This chapter summarizes the genetics underlying obesity and currently available obesity treatments, further discussing the research progress of genome editing in the knowledge and treatment of body fat excess.","['Biomedicine', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Genetics and Genomics', 'Physiology']"

We determined factors associated with favourable outcomes in a large cohort of recipients reported to the Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry (CITR). Methods In 398 non-uraemic islet transplant alone (ITA) recipients with type 1 diabetes and SHEs, transplanted between 1999 and 2015 and with at least 1 year follow-up, we analysed specified favourable outcomes against each of all available characteristics of pancreas donors, islet grafts, recipients and immunosuppressive regimens, as well as immunosuppression and procedure-related serious adverse events (SAEs). Results Four factors were associated with the highest rates of favourable outcomes: recipient age ≥35 years; total infused islets ≥325,000 islet equivalents; induction immunosuppression with T cell depletion and/or TNF-α inhibition; and maintenance with both mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and calcineurin inhibitors. At 5 years after the last islet infusion, of the recipients meeting these four common favourable factors (4CFF; N =126), 95% were free of SHEs, 76% had HbA 1c <53 mmol/mol (7.0%), 73% had HbA 1c <53 mmol/mol (7.0%) and absence of SHEs, and 53% were insulin independent, significantly higher rates than in the remaining recipients (<4CFF; N =272). The incidence of procedural and immunosuppression-related SAEs per recipient that resulted in sequelae, disability or death was low in both the 4CFF (0.056 per person) and <4CFF (0.074 per person) groups. Conclusions/interpretation In recipients with type 1 diabetes complicated by SHEs, islet transplantation meeting 4CFF protected 95% from SHEs at 5 years after the last islet infusion and exerted a large and significant benefit on glycaemic control, with an acceptable safety profile for this subgroup of type 1 diabetes.

Identification, characterization, and detection of damages at the early stages in a plate structure avoid the further growth of damages and prevent the structural failure. In this paper, the strain energy and flexibility matrix-based damage detection procedure is adopted to detect single as well multiple damages in a plate structure. Toward this, a 4-noded plate element is utilized to discretize the rectangular plate with 6° of freedom (dof) at every node. The flexibility matrix is calculated using the natural frequency and mode shape. This method detects the damage in the plate by an increase in flexibility matrix of the damaged one. The damage indicator is then computed by evaluating the changes in strain energy of a structural plate using the coefficients of the flexibility matrices. The modal parameters were extracted from the FE analysis software Abaqus. Nine illustrative examples with damages at various locations are induced by decreasing the modulus of elasticity at the specified elements in plate structure, in order to determine the effectiveness of the method. The numerical result shows that the adopted damage detection procedure can be able to locate the structural damages in plates with lower modes, and the magnitude of the evaluated damage index depends on the severity of the damage.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Building Materials']"

Scarceness of fund, illness, poverty, and pitiable employment opportunities is mainly for the people in the mounting pandemic times. As many employees are often trying to cope up with their health, economic, social, and psychological issues, intelligence comes in their way when they are dealing with the people and working hard in an organization. Social intelligence plays a significant role in their life, in getting along well with others. Hence, the review was done to see if social intelligence works as a tool for human performance optimization, especially for people who are going out and serving others. The secondary data indicate that employee’s performance and social intelligence have a positive relationship. Proper optimization of human performance was seen in people with high social intelligence. Further, studies also indicated that social intelligence enhanced motivation and created values in employees which in turn helped in human performance optimization.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films', 'Energy Systems']"

Limitations of post-hurricane debris removal resources often impede the timely debris removal operation for recovery, thereby intensifying the impact of a disaster. In such trying situations, the planning of temporary debris management sites (TDMS), to serve as designed buffers for the sorting, storing, and processing of debris becomes important for the resilience of a local debris management system. This study develops a framework to find the optimal locations for TDMSs, which meet geographic requirements (i.e., related to their land use, land cover, and proximity to natural and built environments) while minimizing the threats imposed to the communities health and safety due to delayed debris removal operations. Specifically, we performed a geographic information system (GIS) analysis to find possible locations for TDMSs based on various geographic requirements by federal government agencies, such as the US EPA and FEMA. Further, we developed a simulation model to evaluate debris removal performance with various TDMS site options in a post-hurricane planning scenario. Using the AnyLogic Optimization Experiment, the optimal TDMS locations were explored in a way that minimizes the overall debris collection time and adverse impacts on community health. To demonstrate the implementation of the proposed framework, we investigated as a case study the debris removal operation for Liberty County, Florida, in response to a hypothetical hurricane event.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

NIRS provides an assessment of the adequacy of oxygen supply relative to demand in vascular beds, and is the technology used in cerebral oximetry. NIRS has been widely adopted as a monitor of the adequacy of brain tissue oxygenation in anesthesiology and critical care medicine and is also used intraoperatively to monitor the perfusion of the spinal cord and some other somatic vascular beds. Measurements of rScO 2 are affected by patient factors, disease states, physiologic alterations, and the variable technology and algorithms incorporated in the design of commercial monitors. It is essential that clinicians understand the technology that underlies NIRS-based cerebral oximetry so that monitoring data can be interpreted correctly. Cerebral oximetry is influenced by a variety of physiologic inputs that can alert clinicians to dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) and other vital organs. Specifically, cerebral NIRS monitoring integrates the cumulative input of (a) cardiac output, (b) arterial blood pressure, (c) arterial oxygen content, (d) pH and partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ), (e) patency of the CNS vasculature, (f) cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO 2 ), (g) intracranial pressure (ICP), and (h) cerebral autoregulation. Cerebral oximetry is widely used in neonatology, vascular surgery, cardiac surgery, neurologic critical care, and pediatric and adult anesthesia practice. In this chapter, we review (a) the current state of NIRS monitoring technology and its limitations, (b) the physiologic variables that alter tissue oxygen balance, (c) the rationale for the use of cerebral oximetry in critical care medicine and anesthesia practice, (d) the evidence that supports its use in specific patient populations and surgical procedures, and (e) future directions for the development of NIRS technology and clinical applications .","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Anesthesiology', 'Neurosurgery', 'Pain Medicine']"

Due to low-range signal transmission, a lot of small devices are needed to cover a particular area. This leads to a relatively high volume of data generation. A proper mechanism to handle this large amount of data is required. The mechanism needs to mine only the useful data, save the currently generated data, and delete the old and unused data. It should also restrict the sensors to send fewer amounts of data using some mathematical module. The sensors in this way will produce only important information.

Then, in the light of the predominance that commercially oriented technoscience has gained in contemporary scientific institutions, we argue for the importance of developing multi-strategic research in areas such as agriculture. This is needed so that adequate evaluation of the potential risks of large scale applications of technoscience, as well as harm they may have actually occasioned, can be made; and also so that these applications can be rigorously compared with scientifically informed practices, such as agroecology, which are not as problematic for human health and the environment and which explore the regenerative powers of nature itself.","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy of Technology', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'History of Technology']"

In plate-like structures, acoustic emissions propagate through the structure as guided waves. With a measurement location away from the source location, dispersion effects in the guided wave distort the acoustic emission signal. The distortion of the original signal hampers identification of damage mechanisms. This research describes and assesses a method to reconstruct the original acoustic emission signal using dispersion compensation. Simulations and experiments are performed involving thick glass-fibre reinforced plastic laminates. The signal reconstruction on the simulated data gives a reasonable representation of the simulated signal at the location of interest. In the experimental case, similarity slightly degrades. Deviation in arrival time between original measurement and reconstruction is attributed to a possible discrepancy in material properties in reality versus the properties used in the reconstruction.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Complications impair the prognosis and prolong the hospital stay. This study explored the incidence and distribution of complications and their impact on short-term mortality after EL. Methods This was a retrospective single-center register-based cohort study of 674 adults undergoing midline EL between May 2015 and December 2017. The primary outcome was operation-related or medical complication after EL. The secondary outcome was mortality in 90-day follow-up. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent risk factors for complications. Results A total of 389 (58%) patients developed complications after EL, including 215 (32%) patients with operation-related complications and 361 (54%) patients with medical complications. Most of the complications were Clavien-Dindo classification type 4b (28%) and type 2 (22%). Operation-related complications occurred later compared to medical complications. Respiratory complications were the most common medical complications, and infections were the most common operation-related complications. The 30- and 90-day mortalities were higher in both the medical (17.2%, 26.2%) and operation-related complication groups (13.5%, 24.2%) compared to patients without complications (10.5% and 4.8%, 14.8% and 8.0%). Low albumin, high surgical urgency, excessive alcohol consumption and medical complications were associated with operation-related complications. Older age, high ASA class and operation-related complications were associated with medical complications. Conclusions This study demonstrated that EL is associated with a high risk of complications and poor short-term outcome. Complications impair the prognosis regardless of which kind of EL is in question.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgery', 'Abdominal Surgery', 'Cardiac Surgery', 'General Surgery', 'Thoracic Surgery', 'Vascular Surgery']"

Numerous works confirm that local nonlinear sources such as fatigue cracks, plastic zones or delaminations, can distort the propagating ultrasonic waves. It manifests itself in a number of nonlinear phenomena e.g. generation of high-order harmonics, side-bands (cross-modulation), frequency shift or modulation transfer. In this work, the nonlinear modulation transfer for shear horizontal guided waves is scrutinized experimentally. Therefore, the amplitude-modulated pumping wave and monoharmonic probing waves are excited simultaneously in a damaged glass plate using PZT wafer transducers. First, the frequencies of generated pumping and probing waves are selected heuristically based on empirical measurements. Next, the influence of the amplitude ratio and the amplitude modulation index of the excited waves on the modulation transfer intensity is addressed. This parametric study allows to identify the excitation parameters for effective monitoring of the state of the tested specimen using methods based on the modulation transfer phenomenon for shear horizontal waves. It also lays the foundation for future research focused on the damage detection and identification. The conclusions resulting from this experimental study can be used to develop monitoring methods of widespread plate-like mechanical structures based on the discussed nonlinear effect.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Nature-inspired intelligent computing (NIIC) approaches in predicting potential biomarkers and drug targets could be an astonishing bridge between biology/nature with today’s advanced and sophisticated areas like artificial intelligence, deep learning, computer vision, and others. Analyzing disease biomarkers is an emerging field of interest. Several molecular evaluations have been developed to detect biomarkers that indicate disease response to specific therapies. Recognition of these molecules and understanding their molecular mechanisms is critical for disease prognosis and late-stage therapeutics development. Breakthroughs in genomics and transcriptional analyses have significantly increased our understanding of the poorly understood genomic matter or dark matter. The systematic identification of disease-associated lncRNAs has expanded our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of complex diseases, but it has also been shown to have an inherent advantage over protein-coding genes in disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Given the lower efficiency and increased time and cost of biological experiments, computer-aided inference of disease-associated RNAs using nature-inspired intelligent computing methods has emerged as a promising approach for expediting the study of lncRNA functions and providing complementary value for experimental analyses.

A least square minimization with Tikhonov regularization was utilized to estimate the dynamic vehicle force from acceleration data of the vehicle. A band pass filter is applied to the dynamic vehicle force before estimating the difference of the dynamic vehicle force.

Furthermore, it becomes more challenging in countries like India, where major population is vegetarian and farmers still follow old conventional farming methods. Plants’ growth is often affected by viral, bacterial diseases. However, experts’ advice on these plant diseases may be costly and time-consuming matter. Recently, computer vision and machine learning are successfully applied to the smart farming. Plant health can be easily monitored, and syndromes can be easily identified by applying machine learning and image processing techniques, over the conventional methods. Leaves are important part of the plant. It generates food for plants using photosynthesis. Hence, damage to leaf may result in reduced food supply to the plant. This results to lesser growth of the plant and lesser flower and fruit bearing capacity. This paper addresses various bacterial and fungal diseases among plants. Impact of each disease on the leaves such as color and shape is also discussed in this paper. This paper studies various deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural network (CNN) model and learning vector quantization (LVQ) algorithm which can be used to distinguish among healthy and disease plants. Difference between healthy and diseased leave was used to train these deep learning classifier. This paper also addresses remedial actions such as recommendation of specific pesticide and its quantity. It was observed that there exists and tradeoff between practical usage of automated system by farmers and accuracy of the system.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

MEPs, once confined to use in spine procedures, have expanded to procedures where rapid identification of central nervous system (CNS), spinal cord, and peripheral nerve motor function is critical for patient outcomes. Patient’s vulnerability is associated with surgical injury and pre-existing disease or disability (e.g., age, muscular dystrophy, neurovascular and peripheral vascular disease, and tumors). For example, with interventional radiology (IR), when embolizing vessels in a vulnerable area, MEPs are performed prior to and after occlusion to establish whether it is safe to embolize. Temporary motor loss indicates the vessel provides critical perfusion and embolization may cause permanent neurologic deficits. This principle of hypoperfusion/reperfusion applies during reconstructive spine surgery, all vascular and cardiac procedures, and tumor excision in neurologic tissue. The effectiveness of MEP monitoring is directly dependent onw developments in computer technology and anesthetic drugs like propofol. MEPs are uniquely capable of rapidly identifying injury and recovery. This chapter reviews these considerations and applications that have made MEPs a key component of multimodality intraoperative monitoring.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Anesthesiology', 'Neurosurgery', 'Pain Medicine']"

Consistently, demographic studies have shown that teenagers show a high prevalence of rewarding drugs use, mainly nicotine-containing products and cannabis. Clinical researches have associated the adolescence consume of nicotine and cannabis with a higher vulnerability to develop neuropsychiatric diseases in adulthood such as depression, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. Despite these evidence, it is difficult to conclusively prove causal relationships with longitudinal and retrospective clinical research in humans. Accordingly, preclinical animal models are indispensable tools to determine the causal relationship between early neurodevelopmental drug exposure and psychiatric disease risk. Preclinical rodent models have been widely used to research the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the vulnerability of the adolescent brain because the similarities in behavioral patterns and brain maturation processes with human adolescents. Particularly, both human teenager and adolescent rodents show similar patterns of DA maturation, and dysregulations in these neuronal circuits may induce phenotypes associated with psychiatric diseases. This chapter will describe the THC and nicotine adolescent exposure methods in rats that induce a long-term dysregulation of the dopaminergic system. Furthermore, this chapter will detail the experimental protocol used in our laboratory to test the electrical activity of dopaminergic neurons.

In this paper, we propose a natural language processing (NLP) solution that detects ADR’s in such unstructured free-text conversations, which improves on previous work in three ways. First, a new Named Entity Recognition (NER) model obtains state-of-the-art accuracy for ADR and Drug entity extraction on the ADE, CADEC, and SMM4H benchmark datasets ( 91.75 , 78.76 , and 83.41 % F1 scores respectively). Second, two new Relation Extraction (RE) models are introduced—one based on BioBERT while the other utilizing crafted features over a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN)—perform on par with existing state-of-the-art models, and outperform them when trained with a supplementary clinician-annotated RE dataset. Third, a new text classification model, obtains new state-of-the-art accuracy on the CADEC dataset ( 86.69% F1 score).

Oncologic re-resection has been considered standard practice after UPE with positive or uncertain margins. A strategy of active surveillance or “watch and wait” has been suggested as a safe alternative to routine re-excision. In this context, the current study sought to evaluate short-term outcomes and morbidity after re-resection to better understand the risks and benefits of this treatment strategy. Methods A retrospective, single-institution study reviewed patients undergoing oncologic re-resection after UPE of an STS during a 5-year period (2015–2020), excluding those with evidence of gross residual disease. Short-term clinical outcomes were evaluated together with final pathologic findings. Results The review identified 67 patients undergoing re-resection after UPE of an STS. Of these 67 patients, 45 (67%) were treated with a combination of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and surgery. Plastic surgery was involved for reconstruction in 49 cases (73%). The rate of wound complications after re-resection was 45 % ( n = 30), with 15 % ( n = 10) of the patients experiencing a major wound complication. Radiation therapy and plastic surgery involvement were independently associated with wound complications. Notably, 45 patients (67%) had no evidence of residual disease in the re-resection specimen, whereas 13 patients (19 %) had microscopic disease, and 9 patients (13%) had indeterminate pathology. Conclusion Given the morbidity of re-resection and limited identification of residual disease, treatment plans and discussions with patients should outline the expected pathologic findings and morbidity of surgery.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery']"

Delays from inspections often exacerbate the social and economic impact of the disaster on affected communities. Rapid and autonomous inspection using images acquired from unmanned aerial vehicles offer the potential to reduce such delays. Indeed, a vast amount of research has been conducted toward developing automated vision-based methods to assess the health of infrastructure at the component and structure level. Most proposed methods typically rely on images of the damaged structure, but seldom consider how the images were acquired. To achieve autonomous inspections, methods must be evaluated in a comprehensive end-to-end manner, incorporating both data acquisition and data processing. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in computer generated imagery (CGI) to construct a 3D synthetic environment with a digital twin for simulation of post-earthquake inspections that allows for comprehensive evaluation and validation of autonomous inspection strategies. A critical issue is how to simulate and subsequently render the damage in the structure after an earthquake. To this end, a high-fidelity nonlinear finite element model is incorporated in the synthetic environment to provide a representation of earthquake-induced damage; this finite element model, combined with photo-realistic rendering of the damage, is termed herein a physics-based graphics models (PBGM). The 3D synthetic environment with PBGM as a digital twin provides a comprehensive end-to-end approach for development and validation of autonomous post-earthquake strategies using UAVs.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Several structures with historical and monumental importance are instrumented with structural health monitoring (SHM) systems nowadays. However, even the failure of “minor” viaducts could endanger the safety of travelers and goods. Lately, dense wireless sensor networks (WSNs) based on MEMS devices are used to cut costs and simplify the deployment of SHM systems while collecting as much information as possible. However, dense WNSs are affected by data management, synchronization, and battery replacement issues, which make them unappealing for widespread use. This study presents an original damage identification algorithm based on sparse sensor networks. Traveling vehicles are exploited to obtain spatial information and accurately identify the location of structural anomalies. The curvature influence line of the monitored bridge can be calculated by processing the acceleration response measured at a given instrumented location through a low-pass filter. In this procedure, sensors operate individually, not needing energy-consuming synchronization. The proposed identification algorithm is verified on real data collected on a steel truss bridge subject to artificially induced damage.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The Icelandic Road and Coastal Administration decided to use the bridge as a learning tool before it was demolished and a new bridge built on the same site. A realistic assessment of the structural properties and bearing capacity of existing bridges is a prerequisite for evaluating the safety of older bridges in the road system, which were designed according to outdated standards and different load conditions but are required to serve today’s traffic and future demands with an increasing number of heavy vehicles. The data presented in this paper are time series of acceleration measured for ambient loading on the bridge. A system identification analysis of the bridge was performed using two OMA tools. It is found that based on low amplitude ambient vibration data, the first four modes can be reliably estimated in terms of natural frequency and critical damping ratio, but the higher modes are more uncertain, and their identifiability varies depending on the data-set used.

This chapter responds to this need and explores the potential of intersectionality in this area. By approaching intersectionality as an analytical sensibility , this chapter explores the potential of an intersectional interpretive framework to generate knowledge practices that can make contributions to the design, implementation, and development of reflexive democratic deepening processes which take into account the complexity with which human relationships are interwoven with dynamics of domination and privilege.

The Lasater Clinical Judgment Rubric (LCJR) is one of the most frequently used scales for the evaluation of self-assessment among nursing students and it can be used by students and instructors for providing shared clinical judgment feedback. However, too few studies have evaluated its applicability. Objective of the study was to compare the LCJR scores assigned by the instructors with those self-reported by the nursing students to evaluate the students’ self-assessment skills. Methods: A comparative study was conducted in a probabilistic sample of 80 students enrolled in the 3rd year of the Nursing Programme in an Italian University. At the end of the high-fidelity simulation, the students and two instructors completed the LCJR scale. Results: The mean scores reported by instructors and students in the 4 subscales of LCJR were similar. In the 3 subscales, “Interpreting”, “Responding” and “Reflecting”, no significant differences were observed; only in the cognitive domain “Noticing” was a difference at the limit of statistical significance ( p  = 0.049) observed, with a slightly higher scores reported by instructors. Finally, the mean score of Overall Clinical Judgment of the LCJR scale reported by the instructors was slightly higher than that of the students ( p  = 0.044). Conclusions: Our results suggest that LCJR provides a common language between students and teachers and increases the training effectiveness of high-fidelity simulation through self-directed and reflective learning.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In Ecuador, there are about 1,300,000 older adults, and falls are a major problem for their quality of life. For this reason, in this article, we present a low-cost prototype system for the monitoring and detection of falls, with the aim of providing support for the care of older adults. This tool is based on a module that applies computer vision and image processing techniques, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Web and mobile applications. They allow the monitoring and control of falls. To test the operation of the system, tests were carried out with fifteen volunteers. It was determined that the system managed to correctly detect 80% of fall-related events.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Health Informatics', 'Statistics, general']"

Static loading leads to noticeable permanent deformation in structures. Hence, failure can be predictable earlier. On the contrary, dynamic loading develops fluctuating stresses. Fluctuating stress leads to initiation of fatigue crack in composite structures. Fatigue crack initiation and its propagation are main cause of failures. Prier detection of crack and its severity is essential to avoid catastrophic failure of structure. Available conventional damage detection methods are time taking, expensive and may require unassembled from machines. Hence, now, more emphasis is given on unconventional methods. In this work, a damage detection method is introduced through fuzzy logic system (FLS) and regression analysis (RA). Statistical process control methods are applied, and investigations made on a cantilever composite beam with a crack. A data pool has been extracted from analytical method. Then, the search space was trained by that proposed methodology to get damage location. The result of the proposed methodology found within the permissible limit.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Materials Engineering']"

Most of the initial studies focused on the monoamine system; however, recently other mechanisms have come under investigation. Specific to the current issue, studies show synaptic involvement in depression. Other articles in this issue report on reductions in synaptic density, dendritic spines, boutons and glia associated with stress and depression. Importantly, it appears that some drugs (e.g., ketamine) may lead to rapid synaptic restoration or synaptogenesis. Direct evidence for this comes from preclinical work. However, neuroimaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), have become useful in assessing these changes in vivo. Here, we describe the use of neuroimaging techniques in the evaluation of synaptic alterations associated with depression in humans, as well as measurement of synaptic restoration after administration of ketamine. Although more research is desired, use of these techniques widen our understanding of depression and move us further along the path to targeted and effective treatment for depression.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Psychiatry', 'Neurosciences', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Biological Psychology']"

The violence often times threatens cohesion within the DR. To sustain the DR, most countries adopt the criminalisation approach by enacting statutes that prescribe punishment for acts of domestic violence (DV). In Nigeria, Violence against Persons (Prohibition) Act 2015 (VAPPA) was enacted to curb domestic violence using this approach. However, there are emerging issues from that law that could impede its effectiveness. These include non-desirability of victims for criminal prosecution, consequential effect of penal punishment on cohesion of the domestic relationship, application of criminal law to domestic dispute, among other issues. The VAPPA applies to Nigerian Muslims who have the religious obligation and constitutional right to apply the Islamic law as their personal law. This work therefore examines the perspective to which Islamic law addresses those emerging issues from the legal framework on domestic violence in Nigeria with a view to providing alternative approach. Doctrinal method of research was adopted to answer the research questions and execute the objectives of this work. It is observed that criminalisation affects the cohesion of DR due to the societal attitude towards the criminal approach. Islamic law does not favour the application of criminal punishment in the case of hurt or death between family members but it approves the payment of diyah (compensation) or forgiveness. It is concluded that the use of penal approach to resolve domestic dispute or violence is not effective enough to curb the violence. Therefore, there is a need to adopt the Shari’ah mechanisms of dispute resolution which will sustain domestic cohesion by way of legal borrowing.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'African Politics']"

This sensor provides benefits that makes them excellent supplements for, and in some cases replacements for, conventional AE sensors. The SH wave sensors provide benefits including simpler velocity settings, more consistent source localization, and reduced environmental noise from sources such as rain and wind-driven particles. These advantages arise due to the distinct differences in the wave mechanics of the SH wave modes compared to Lamb wave modes (A0 and S0, for example). Note that the SH0 mode is non-dispersive with the highest group velocity of all SH-type modes and it features pure in-plane vibration. Another benefit of the SH AE sensors is that they provide sensitivity to the SH wave modes that are produced from almost every type of AE source, but have been almost entirely neglected during AE testing. This otherwise neglected wave mode carries significant portions of energy and information contained in acoustic emissions. The inability to detect this mode creates a limitation in source detection and characterization. The SH AE sensor can be used with conventional (Lamb-type) AE sensors for source detection, localization, and characterization.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

In today's pandemic situation, due to working from home, employees are working for long hours, and spending long hours is a pretty challenging task. Nowadays, irrespective of age concerns, sciatica, Kyphosis, and lordosis are becoming a significant problem even for youngsters. The longest nerve in our body is sciatica, which causes severe pain due to stress applied while sitting in the wrong posture. It gets compressed with our lower back discs, which may lead to severe radiating pain from our lower back disc to the entire right leg, and a person can't even perform his daily activities comfortably. To prevent these problems, sitting posture while working should be maintained correctly. This work mainly focuses on preventing employers, and students from sciatica, Kyphosis, and Lordosis health issues. We used all kinds of sitting postures that interact while working with a laptop, classified which posture was good, and predicted which stance led to health issues. We used Convolutional Neural Network and K-Nearest Neighbor machine learning algorithms to predict the correct sitting postures. In KNN, we followed two techniques to improve the performance: using Edge detection. The other method we used was detecting facial landmark detection and plotting their respective rotational angles. So by using this technique, we improved the accuracy and precision rate compared to the classical Edge detection. We also trained the model with CNN, which gives good results. We performed a comparative analysis to pick the best model to integrate with OpenCV to make it real-time.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In an idealized setting, such damage induces a rank-deficient transfer matrix perturbation, whose null space carries information on the spatial damage distribution. The information can be materialized by applying the null vectors, referred to as dynamic damage-locating vectors (DDLVs), as loads to the given system, which will confine damage to the subdomain exhibiting rigid-body motion. In real systems, where the transfer matrix perturbation will not be rank-deficient, the DDLVs must be extracted from a quasi-null space, and this will impair the discrimination between undamaged and damaged subdomains. This paper explores the merit of adding flexibility in the design of the DDLVs by implementing virtual output feedback with the aim of ameliorating the discrimination problem. The virtual implementation allows one to design and realize closed-loop systems, and hereby closed-loop DDLVs, from the identified open-loop system. Different design criteria, each theoretically amenable to enhance the damage resolution provided by the closed-loop DDLVs, are proposed and subsequently tested in a numerical example.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Traffic flow prediction is an important problem in intelligent transportation system (ITS). Various studies have been reported in the literature for traffic flow prediction in which combined models have been proposed only using traffic flow data. It is evident from the traffic flow theory that speed and flow are inter-related. Therefore, considering speed to predict flow in a model can help in improving the performance of a prediction method. Keeping this in mind, we propose a traffic flow prediction method consisting of two branches. First branch predicts traffic flow using past flow data through long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. Second branch predicts volume using Gaussian process regression (GPR) based on temporal speed. Finally, prediction from both the branches was combined through weighted average. The mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and Pearson’s correlation coefficient ( r ) were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Based on these measures, it was found that results of our proposed model are promising.","['Engineering', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Sustainable Development']"

Furthermore, among other methods, halo formation assays have become popular for the detection of polyester-hydrolase activity. However, established halo-formation assays are limited in their ability to screen for thermostable enzymes, which are particularly important for efficient plastic degradation. The incubation of screening plates at temperatures above 50 °C leads to cell lysis and death. Therefore, equivalent master plates are commonly required to maintain and identify the active strains found on the screening plates. This replica plating procedure necessitates 20- to 60-fold more plates than our method, assuming the screened library is transferred to 384-well microtiter plates or 96-well microtiter plates, respectively, to organize the colonies in a retraceable manner, thus significantly lowering throughput.

These ‘at-risk’ individuals are those with respiratory and pulmonary illnesses. Currently pollution is monitored by High-Cost pollution sensors (HCPS) which can be deployed in limited fashion due to expense. A low-cost alternative can be used to provide greater sensor density for the same budget thereby better informing the ‘at-risk’ population. This study compares the accuracy of low-cost particulate matter sensors as an alternative to a HCPS that are generally used for this purpose. In our evaluation a low-cost sensor was co-located with a HCPS for a period of one month. Data was collected from both sensors in order to enable a comparison. Raw data comparison showed that readings generated from our low-cost sensor fell within the same Air Quality Index (AQI) banding as data from the HCPS. Although the data produced by the low-cost sensor is functionally accurate (classification of pollution within the AQI bands), accuracy could be improved using an algorithmic calibration curve. This could allow for many low-cost systems to be deployed across a wider geographical city area, improving coverage.

We hypothesised that an increased glucose threshold for beta cell secretion explains IFG. Methods We used graded glucose infusion to examine the relationship of insulin secretion rate (ISR) and glucagon secretion rate (GSR) with rising glucose. We studied 39 non-diabetic individuals (53 ± 2 years, BMI 30 ± 1 kg/m 2 ), categorised by fasting glucose and glucose tolerance status. After an overnight fast, a variable insulin infusion was used to maintain glucose at ~4.44 mmol/l (07:00 to 08:30 hours). At 09:00 hours, graded glucose infusion commenced at 1 mg kg −1 min −1 and doubled every 60 min until 13:00 hours. GSR and ISR were calculated by nonparametric deconvolution from concentrations of glucagon and C-peptide, respectively. Results The relationship of ISR with glucose was linear and the threshold for insulin secretion in isolated IFG did not differ from that in people with normal fasting glucose and normal glucose tolerance. GSR exhibited a single-exponential relationship with glucose that could be characterised by G 50 , the change in glucose necessary to suppress GSR by 50%. G 50 was increased in IFG compared with normal fasting glucose regardless of the presence of impaired or normal glucose tolerance. Conclusions/interpretation These data show that, in non-diabetic humans, alpha cell dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of IFG independently of defects in insulin secretion. We also describe a new index that quantifies the suppression of glucagon secretion by glucose.

However, since each of these VMs must bring their own licensed OS, they are large images, and there tends to be a lot of “wasted space” because, for example, three Windows VMs would be storing three copies of the OS in memory, plus the instance of the OS from the system on which the VMs are running.

Phenomena such as differential settlements, damage or failure of structural elements, overloads, etc., cause buildings to behave differently than expected. When any of these phenomena occur, due to multiple factors, it is not possible to determine precisely the distribution of stresses in the building and therefore, it is difficult to establish with any degree of reliability if there are elements that may be subjected to stress levels that could cause a critical failure of the structure. In this paper, the development of a low-cost fiber optic-based transducer intended to force/stress measuring in civil structure pillars within the SHM context is presented. Test transducers were embedded in scale reduced columns, which were submitted to compression loads using a testing bench rig. Transducers successfully measured strain levels up to 200 $$\upmu \upepsilon $$ μ ϵ under compression load with an accuracy of ±1 $$\upmu \upepsilon $$ μ ϵ . Strains and applied force were linearly related. Through finite element analysis (FEA), a sensing scheme was designed for the first floor of a 32-story-tall building composed of 32 columns where each column includes one embedded transducer. The constructive phase of building will start by April 2022, when transducers will be embedded within the structure.

The main environmental effects that could affect the built environment (e.g., temperature, hydraulic balance, etc.) are also analyzed in terms of the power spectrum and spectral entropy. The main frequencies associated with both environmental data and remote displacements are highlighted. A more in-depth knowledge of the inputs of a system would allow to perform more significant virtual experiments or numerical predictions, also contemplating new sources of excitation for civil structures at nanohertz.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

This study explored correlations of clinical factors and dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters with postoperative cardiopulmonary complications and predicted their risk by establishing a nomogram model. Methods Clinical and DVH parameters of ESCC patients who underwent trimodality treatment from 2002 to 2020 were collected. Postoperative cardiopulmonary complications were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was applied, and a nomogram model was constructed. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analyses were performed to evaluate the performance of the nomogram. Results Of the 307 ESCC patients enrolled in this study, 65 (21.2%) experienced pulmonary complications and 57 (18.6%) experienced cardiac complications. The following six risk factors were identified as independent risk factors for pulmonary complications by multivariate logistic regression analyses in the integrated model: male sex (odds ratio [OR], 3.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27–9.70; P = 0.021), post-radiation therapy (RT) forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (OR, 0.51; 95% CI 0.28–0.90; P = 0.023), mean lung dose (MLD) (OR, 1.13; 95% CI 1.01–1.28; P = 0.041), and pre-RT monocyte (OR, 8.36; 95% CI 1.23–11.7; P = 0.03). The AUC of this integrated model was 0.705 (95% CI 0.64–0.77). The paclitaxel and cisplatin (TP) concurrent chemotherapy regimen was the independent predictor of cardiac complication (OR, 2.50; 95% CI 1.22–5.55; P = 0.016). Conclusions For ESCC patients who underwent trimodality treatment, male sex, post-RT FEV1, MLD, and pre-RT monocyte were confirmed as significant predictors of postoperative pulmonary complications. A nomogram model including six risk factors was further established. The independent predictor of cardiac complication was TP concurrent chemotherapy.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery']"

In practical scenarios, where the operational and environmental uncertainties might be responsible for significant, additive noise levels, models more sophisticated than the standard ones are required. This requirement can be efficiently pursued via Errors–In–Variables (EIV) systems, which offer a powerful means to precisely tackling inherent disturbances hidden within real signals. In this work, we overcome the limitations of the classical implementation of output–only EIV models in the time domain by adopting a novel frequency domain approach defined in the Frisch scheme to solve, in a more direct way, the trade–off between frequency resolution and noise level. When applied for vibration diagnostics of a large-scale structure (i.e., a wind turbine blade prototype), the novel EIV–based SysId strategy proved significant accuracy in tracking frequency–related structural changes. Thus, it can be considered as a promising strategy for vibration assessment thanks to its reduced computational complexity and the quality of the retrieved spectral signature.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

They can result from factors associated with the surgical procedure, anesthesia, the overall physiologic condition, positioning, or technical aspects of IOM. We describe algorithms to promote rapid identification of the causes of IOM changes. A key component—and frequent point of failure—of the response to an IOM change is effective communication among the surgical, anesthesia, and IOM teams. Therefore, we also describe foundations for effective communication and how to implement them in procedures where IOM is performed. The chapters that follow present examples of various applications of intraoperative monitoring (IOM). After a discussion of the patient problem or a surgical approach, the application of monitoring is presented. The authors have provided examples of IOM changes that may signal adverse neurophysiological conditions. When this occurs, effective communication is needed as a search for the etiology and possible corrective, or supportive measures is pursued.

The conceptual model relied on the measured hydro-geological data and boundary conditions related to hydraulic conductivity, storage coefficient, specific yield, general head, recharge and river boundary. The model calibration yields a linear correlation coefficient of 0.978 for flow model and 0.947 for the transport model. Sensitivity analysis of the calibrated model shows that migration of fluoride is more susceptible to changes in hydraulic conductivity than other input parameters. From the scenario analysis of the conceptual model, different rates of fluoride migration in different stratigraphic layers of the aquifer have been observed. The simulation results inferred that horizontal migration of fluoride had made the surroundings of the contaminated aquifer unsafe for drinking water and irrigation purposes. From both scenario and sensitivity analyses, it has been found that some common hydrologic phenomenon prevails in subsurface environment of the study area that leads to enrichment and migration of fluoride from the contaminated zone to the other part of the model domain along with groundwater flow.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Water, general', 'Ecology', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology', 'Environmental and Sustainability Education']"

Phytic acid is the primary form in which phosphorus can be stored in legumes, nuts, cereals, legumes, and oil seeds. It has a property of chelating micronutrient and hence makes them unavailable for monogastric animals, including humans. The unavailability of phytic acid is due to the lack of phytase enzyme present in the digestive tract. In this review, we have discussed about sources, variation, and digestibility of phytic acid and diverse approaches for reducing phytic acid in food crops. Different approaches like soaking, fermentation, transgenics, and marker-assisted selection have been discussed.

In recent years, researchers have carried out certain research on the seismic performance of this kind of bridge, while there is still a lack of research on modal parameters under earthquakes action. In order to further understand the vibration characteristics of PSCFST bridge under earthquake action, based on the modal parameter identification process of covariance-driven random subspace identification (COV-SSI), this paper analyze the modal parameters of PSCFST bridge under different water depth conditions and different ground motion directions using the shaking table test of PSCFST single-span bridge. In three different water depth environments, namely: water depth of 1.5 m, water depth of 1.8 m, and no water, seismic ground motion in vertical and horizontal (along the direction of the bridge) directions was added through shaking table test to obtain the acceleration response of the bridge. The signal is used as the input data of the covariance random subspace method to obtain the natural frequencies and damping ratios of the first four modes under 6 different working conditions. The analysis results show that the algorithm has a good identification effect on the modal parameters of the PSCFST bridge, in which, water has a small effect on the natural frequency but a large effect on the damping ratio. The COV-SSI method provides theoretical support for the application of structural health monitoring system in PSCFST bridges.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Public Policy', 'Arts']"

The main assumption, to be explored and defended further here, is that plausible accounts of well-being must hold these conflicting experiences in tension to sustain and enhance well-being. Moreover, examining this tension, opens up further debate concerning how well-being is best promoted. For example, these conflicting experiences do not necessarily imply that a person should pursue ‘balance’ in her life to enhance her well-being, experiencing, say, roughly equivalent amounts of unconscious absorption and self-conscious critical reflection. Instead, it suggests that a person should ‘attune’ her life to the idiosyncratic and conflicting ontological characteristics of who she is, which may, or may not, include pursuing this kind of ‘balanced life’. Attunement reflects the very particularised and unique expressions of this person, and how she is leading her life, with the ‘valued objects’ she pursues also often being incommensurable and therefore largely incomparable. More broadly, recognising this kind of incommensurability also generates normative conflicts concerning how well-being is best understood and promoted in social policy and welfare practice. Subsequently, the conflicts and tensions implied in this deeply pluralist understanding of well-being, allows for multi-layered and rich experiences of well-being. The resulting variety and complexity of these experiences need to be fully accommodated when promoting well-being in social policy and welfare practice. Finally, in the concluding remarks, a summary is made of the principal assertions defended in the book, and its defence of what is called here, The Ontology of Well-Being Thesis (TOWT).","['Philosophy', 'Political Philosophy', 'Employee Health and Wellbeing', 'Social Policy', 'Politics of the Welfare State', 'Social Work and Community Development', 'Comparative Social Policy']"

The standard of living in the world is increasing, but people's awareness of environmental protection is also increasing. In practice, however, it turns out that the introduction of green energy solutions to the market also poses various problems. The purpose of this discussion is to attempt to assess the environmental impact of green energy. The chapter presents issues related to the impact of green energy on environmental protection, both in terms of benefits and problems resulting from the widespread use of green technologies. The literature research suggests that every way of obtaining energy is not entirely environmentally friendly. However, the researchers agree that the benefits of green energy are much greater than the negative consequences, and the latter occurs mainly in the production, installation and disposal of energy devices. Low emissions of harmful gases to the atmosphere and no release of toxic pollutants into water reservoirs place renewable energy sources on the right side of environmental protection.","['Energy', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Research Skills', 'Political Science and International Relations, general', 'Sustainable Development']"

Through continued developments in microscopy, and other analytical methods, the importance of lipids as constituents of subcellular organelles, signalling or regulating molecules continues to emerge. The increasing recognition of the importance of lipids to fundamental cell biology (in health and disease) has prompted the development of protocols and techniques to image the distribution of lipids in cells and tissues. A diverse suite of spectroscopic and microscopy tools are continuously being developed and explored to add to the “toolbox” to study lipid biology. A relatively recent breakthrough in this field has been the development and subsequent application of metal-based luminescent complexes for imaging lipids in biological systems. These metal-based compounds appear to offer advantages with respect to their tunability of the photophysical properties, in addition to capabilities centred around selectively targeting specific lipid structures or classes of lipids. The presence of the metal centre also opens the path to alternative imaging modalities that might not be applicable to traditional organic fluorophores. This review examines the current progress and developments in metal-based luminescent complexes to study lipids, in addition to exploring potential new avenues and challenges for the field to take.","['Chemistry', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Biochemistry, general']"

With this, issues such as consumption and generation, composition and recycling techniques were raised. The equipment/waste addressed were cell phones and smartphones, LED lamps, computers, and electrical wires and cables, which were chosen due to their great generation, for being more current technologies, their great applicability and quantity, and variety of valuable and critical materials in their compositions. All this waste shows a notable quantity and variety of precious and technological metals, and of rare-earth elements, all metals of great interest and research today. All except electrical wires and cables show considerable portions of gold, for example, which is a precious metal of great applicability, and which has been achieving high yield values, being, with this, one of the metals most studied by researchers. On the other hand, electrical wires and cables are waste, which is present in almost every WEEE, and are rich in copper and PVC, which are materials of great use in the most diverse areas. In any case, there is a need for the development of viable techniques of recovery of these metals, as well as the development of viable industrial processes. Important steps, such as disassembly and mechanical processing, should be developed, as they enable better revenues, in addition to the development of more sustainable and productive recovery procedures. As well as the development of designs that aim to facilitate the end of life of these products, seeking to meet the precepts of the tripod of sustainability, industrial ecology, and, more recently, the circular economy strategy, where all materials, not only metals, of this waste are recovered, valued, and recycled.","['Chemistry', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general', 'Waste Management/Waste Technology', 'Green Chemistry']"

Cyanobacteria or blue-green algae hold biological nitrogen fixation properties through which they fix atmospheric nitrogen to reduced forms. These algae fix nitrogen either as a free-living form or in symbiotic associations. More than 20 kg of N ha −1 and organic matter available in soil are fixed by cyanobacteria. The easily available and less expensive eco-friendly cyanobacterial fertilizers control the nitrogen deficiency in soil, aeration capacity, and water holding capacity of the soil. The high cost of chemical nitrogen fertilizers replaces with the cost-effective cyanobacterial fertilizers. The economically feasible methods of cultivation enabled the successful large-scale production of cyanobacterial fertilizer. The initial production methods of cyanobacterial fertilizers were easy and inexpensive and widely adopted by the farmers in their fields. There are open and closed system cultivation methods using sunlight and artificial light. The effective application of cyanobacterial biofertilizers has reduced the burden of economically weak farmers to substitute expensive chemical nitrogen fertilizers. Nitrogen biofertilizers are the most putative fertilizers in the Asia-pacific biofertilizer market and received huge attention from consumers. Recently, there has been an enormous demand for cyanobacterial biofertilizers in Asia, especially the Indian subcontinent, for extensive application in the paddy fields. The deteriorated soil health in India accelerated the translation of cyanobacterial biofertilizer technology from the laboratory to small-scale, large-scale, and commercial sectors.

In this study, 86 paratroopers were selected as the research objects by stratified sampling method. The frequency and impact of stress events, frequency and effect of coping styles in paratroopers were investigated by Likert five point scales. The results showed that paratroopers in different positions had significant differences only in the stress event of workplace interpersonal conflict. The influence of workplace interpersonal conflict on the psychological state of officers is significantly higher than that of sergeants and soldiers. Officers and sergeants prefer to use exercise and breathing relaxation to deal with stress events, while soldiers prefer to play video games to deal with stress events. The results of this study indicate that the types of stress events and preferred coping styles of paratroopers in each position are different.

In recent years, the techniques and technologies of livestock production have changed significantly. Robotic feeding, milking, harvesting and processing systems are being introduced. High-quality products require impeccable milk quality. Robotics in the process management and control systems are becoming more sophisticated and increasingly affordable. The dairy industry is changing dramatically. An integrated approach to the rational conduct of dairy business allows agricultural enterprises to advance to a more efficient level of production organization (Abeni et al. in J Dairy Sci 88:3542–3552, 2005 ). Robotic milking is widely accepted, especially in Western Europe, as a way to reduce workforce on dairy farms, increase production per cow and improve the lifestyle of dairy farm families milking 40–250 cows (De Koning in Automatic milking–common practice on dairy farms. pp. 52–67, 2010 ). The growing popularity of this technology can be seen in its rapid rate of implementation. In 2009, the estimated number of robotic dairy farms worldwide was 8000 (De Koning in Automatic milking–common practice on dairy farms. pp. 52–67, 2010 ). Only 6 years later (Barkema et al. in J Dairy Sci 98:7426–7445, 2015 ), it was suggested that this number had more than tripled to 25,000 dairy farms worldwide. The percentage of herds milked with this technology is highest in Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands (Barkema et al. in J Dairy Sci 98:7426–7445, 2015 ).","['Engineering', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Agriculture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

StructuralHealth Monitoring (SHM) allows to ensure in real-time that aircraft substructures can still perform their function. Among all the technologies used in SHM, the emission/reception of Lamb waves are very popular. Algorithms using Lamb waves for damage detection and localization already exist in the literature but damage size estimation is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose an approach to quantify delamination damage size by relying on an analytical scattering model. The structure considered is a plate equipped with piezoelectric transducers (PZT) acting both as actuators and sensors. We use the framework of the Mindlin-Kane plate theory to describe S0-mode Lamb wave propagation. The damage considered is a cylindrical inhomogeneity where the mechanical properties are different from the rest of the plate. The analytical model takes into account the signal emission by a PZT, the scattering by the damage, and the reception by a sensor PZT. This model is then used in an identification process to estimate the size of the damage by minimizing a dedicated cost function. The proposed approach is applied on aluminum plate simulation data.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Since temperature affects ultrasonic velocity, temperature fluctuations and non-uniform temperature distributions in components are a major source of uncertainty for ultrasonic measurements. Recently, ultrasound-based temperature sensing methods have gained increasing attention because of their ability to measure subsurface temperature distributions in solid media. While conventional ultrasonic techniques can either measure the thickness of a component at constant temperature or the (subsurface) temperature of the component at constant thickness, measurement accuracy and precision can be greatly compromised if both factors vary simultaneously. In this work, we explore a dual wave approach to overcome this limitation of the conventional methods. Results of simulation and experimental studies show that co-located shear and longitudinal pulse echo measurements can be used to determine both the thickness and through-thickness temperature gradient of a steel plate while the structure is undergoing thickness loss at rapidly changing temperature.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Second, we explain why non-profits should aim for data capability that differs in relation to context, comparing it with data literacy and data maturity as outcomes. We propose benefits from collaborating with data and data analytics because it enables access to wider resources and more holistic solutions. We end by summarising the current relationship between citizens who are often in non-profit data as clients and customers and the lack of routine ways for non-profits to engage citizens in data work. We highlight this space of working with citizens as one where experiments and new ideas are forming.

In industrial territories, people that suffer from chronic respiratory diseases, e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, occupational lung diseases and pulmonary hypertension require special care, targeted information and efficient treatment, when the environment deteriorates their condition. This article presents the design of an IoT framework that wirelessly connects devices of low-cost, low-power consumption and integrates multi-sensor measurement capabilities (CO 2 concentration, humidity, temperature, particulate matters concentrations) with an open-source IoT platform aiming to alert the aforementioned population, when the combination of aerial pollution and weather conditions severe impact their daily activities. The energy autonomy of the IoT devices that are connected via wireless sensor network is explored and utilized. Finally, we evaluate the functionality and the accuracy of the low-cost sensors and demonstrate how proper filtering can improve their performance and mitigate problems stemming from outage times. For the latter, we have evaluate the effectiveness of forecasting algorithms like ARIMAX, LSTM and PROPHET on the measurement data.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

However, due to its complex working conditions and sophisticated degradation mechanisms, IC engines commonly suffer various types of malfunctioning and faults, which affects their performance in power delivery. Therefore, it is important to monitor the condition of IC engines and detect faults occurred in time. In this paper, two unsupervised data-driven models using machine learning techniques are employed and investigated for the purpose of online condition monitoring and fault isolation of IC engines. A misfire and a lubrication system filter blocking faults are experimentally studied on a purposely built marine engine test rig. The performance of the two models and their contribution maps are discussed, which provides guidance for using such unsupervised models for the condition monitoring and fault detection of IC engines.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements']"

Sorption being considered as an economical and effective technique for removal of As from water. Saskatchewan is a province with a large agriculture industry that produces waste products that are readily available for use in other applications. Agricultural wastes are increasingly recognized as excellent sources for the creation of biosorbents (i.e., biological masses, ‘biomasses’ that can adsorb/absorb contaminants) that are able to treat waters and wastewaters contaminated. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of biosorbents derived from locally available agricultural wastes in Saskatchewan, including canola and wheat straw, in removing As from water. The results indicated that both canola straw (CS) and wheat straw (WS) biomasses are able to sorb As from water; however, sorption capacities were lower than those of the chemically modified biomasses reported in the literature. In general, CS showed higher sorption capacities at high pH values (7–10), while WS was more effective at lower pH values (4–5). Sorption kinetic studies indicated that the sorption rates were slow, thus the required time to reach sorption equilibrium is in the range of days, not hours. While using biosorbents derived from agricultural waste may be a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly method for the removal of As, and potentially other contaminants, adding a chemical treatment process of these materials is suggested to help increase their sorption rates and capacities.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

This paper examines the situation where the spatial distribution of the nonlinear terms is not known. The first issue is to determine the number of active nonlinearities, and this is done by noting that the number is equal to the effective rank of a certain matrix that can be formed using Fourier transforms of the outputs. If the number of unknown inputs plus the number of active nonlinearities is less than the number of outputs, and the spatial position of the nonlinearities and inputs is known, the problem is well-posed. In the case where the spatial distribution of the nonlinearities is not known but the matrix that describes it as pseudo-force is sparse, the problem can be usually solved by iterations without much difficulty, at least in modestly sized problems. When the matrix is not sparse, however, as is the case when the nonlinearities enter the system at coordinates that are not in the dynamic model, the solution is no longer unique.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-07322-9_70,en,A Novel Procedure for Damping Ratio Identification from Free Vibration Tests with Application to Existing Bridge Decks,OriginalPaper,"Damping is an inherent structural property that plays an important role in the overall behavior of dynamical systems, and it can also represent a potential indicator of their health. However, its estimation is often affected by significant uncertainties, which are attributable to measurement noise, test conditions (e.g., environment, level and type of applied loads), and identification technique. In this contribution, a novel procedure is developed for modal damping ratio identification from free vibration tests, which exploits a tuned version of the Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) technique for signal decomposition. Once the time history response of each mode is extracted, relations among areas forming from the free-decay time-domain response are used to estimate the modal damping ratio of each mode. This approach mitigates the detrimental effect of noise contamination likely occurring in real signals. Two applications are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed identification strategy. The first example deals with the analysis of a theoretical signal (with pre-defined frequencies and damping ratios) for validation purposes. A real signal related to the free vibration response of a prestressed concrete bridge deck is finally examined. Based on the obtained results, the proposed identification strategy proved to be efficient and suitable for automatic implementations, thereby resulting particularly attractive for practical applications.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

How this microscopic-macroscopic interaction occurs is poorly understood, as researchers frequently examine models within particular ranges of abstraction and scale. Computational neuroscience and machine learning models offer theoretically powerful analyses of plasticity in neural networks, but results are often siloed and only coarsely linked to biology. In this review, we examine connections between these areas, asking how network computations change as a function of diverse features of plasticity and vice versa. We review how plasticity can be controlled at synapses by calcium dynamics and neuromodulatory signals, the manifestation of these changes in networks, and their impacts in specialized circuits. We conclude that metaplasticity—defined broadly as the adaptive control of plasticity—forges connections across scales by governing what groups of synapses can and can’t learn about, when, and to what ends. The metaplasticity we discuss acts by co-opting Hebbian mechanisms, shifting network properties, and routing activity within and across brain systems. Asking how these operations can go awry should also be useful for understanding pathology, which we address in the context of autism, schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Psychiatry', 'Neurosciences', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Biological Psychology']"

Numerical models based on the finite element method are built to simulate wave propagation and collect data in the time domain. A curved gradient-index phononic crystal (GRIN-PC) lens is implemented to redirect the plane wave to a single point where a single sensor is sufficient to record the interaction of plane wave with the pipe geometry. Parametric studies are carried out and generalized to determine the trends for different defect size, orientation, and axial positions. Signal difference coefficient (SDC) is selected as a damage index based on the modified dispersion properties and the results of principal components analysis. Since the damage information is focused at a single location, the need for using an array of transducers for sensing is eliminated. With the changes in the dispersion of T(0, 1) caused by the GRIN-PC lens, localized defects can be detected earlier than in a plain pipe, before they reach a significant thickness of the pipe wall.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

However, heritage workers generally lack a theoretical understanding of resilience, and there is a dearth of case studies providing objective evidence and examples of good practice in this field. This article argues that an interdisciplinary approach to resilience enables heritage workers to reframe heritage in the larger framework of disaster risk prevention and promoting resilience. It provides an outline of three key terms which form the theoretical basis for this reframing and argues that undesignated heritage recording people’s daily lives (“small heritage”) can play a powerful role in building resilience. It next introduces three case studies from the Japanese triple disaster of 2011 to demonstrate how “small heritage” can promote resilience. The first two examples are cases of psychologists collaborating with historians to provide an appraisal of the psychosocial effects of salvaging “small heritage.” This project not only yields objective evidence that preserving “small heritage” can provide a powerful form of psychosocial support, but it also demonstrates that interdisciplinary collaboration can yield results beyond those possible by either historians or psychologists acting alone. The third case is an example of how the administration of a town affected by the nuclear reactor accident in Fukushima is using salvaging “small heritage” to help the town survive as a community in the face of total evacuation, dispersal of its residents, and discriminatory backlash.","['Business and Management', 'Sustainability Management', 'Social Policy', 'Natural Hazards', 'Climate Change Management and Policy', 'Environmental Law/Policy/Ecojustice']"

A plethora of automated or semi-automated inspection systems have been engineered to enable the robotic manipulation of specific types of sensors. Robotic inspection systems are usually operated through off-line programmed tool-paths. This approach works well when an accurate model of the part is available and the robotic inspection takes place in a well-structured environment, where the part position is precisely registered with respect to the robot reference system. However, it makes the inspection setup for each new part very time-consuming and dependent on the skills and experience of the robot programmer. Moreover, the real geometry of a part may significantly deviate from its digital counterpart, resulting in inaccurate tool paths. This work introduces a new approach capable of conferring full autonomy to robotic sensing applications, providing a breakthrough in the state-of-the-art. As a result of this work, fully autonomous single-pass geometric and volumetric inspection of complex parts, using one single robotized sensor, becomes possible.

With advances in materials, design, and automation, the masonry work system may be modified to minimize the bodily harm associated with the industry. Analysis of the extensive motion data collected on masonry work enables us to understand the ergonomic risks of masonry tasks. Previous studies found that expert masons adopted ergonomically safer and more productive work methods than less experienced masons, as from analyzing the experts’ body kinematics and biomechanical force levels during masonry activities, we can provide training for a safer and more productive generation of masons. To achieve these goals, we investigated the expert masons’ work methods during four masonry activities to determine the associated risk. Specifically, eight expert masons with over 20 years of experience, laid out 16.6 kg concrete masonry units (CMUs) to construct (1) a standard wall, (2) a reinforced wall, (3) a wall in constraint space (under ceiling), and (4) a lead (first) course. Motion capture suits captured their motions, and a biomechanical analysis determined the load experienced by major body joints in each activity. The study found that the most critical body joints were in the lower back and upper limbs, as strain to these joints may lead to days away from work or, in severe cases, retirement.

Previous research has talked about the different methods used for remediating Brownfields, the differences between successful and unsuccessful brownfield sites, Brownfield’s regeneration, and the successful factors linked to the regeneration. However, with the underlying problems of hazardous contaminants and waste accumulated in Brownfield sites throughout their operational life cycles, it is essential to prioritize the remediation process of Brownfield sites based on the time, cost, and efforts needed while maximizing the environmental, economic, and social aspects of sustainability. This study presents a framework for a systematic approach to assess and prioritize the Brownfields considered for remediation with respect to the three dimensions of sustainability. The framework utilizes the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to compare the decision criteria and their attributes and evaluate the Brownfield candidate sites.

As HbA1c is the measure of the fraction of glycated hemoglobin out of total hemoglobin in red blood cells, both blood glucose levels and blood cell conditions affect levels of HbA1c. Consistently, genome-wide association studies on HbA1c have identified multiple genetic loci, largely grouped into two separate pathways – via the glycemic pathway and via the erythrocyte pathway. Two genetic variants, G6PD -rs1050828 and HBB -rs334, specifically found in individuals with African ancestry, were noted for their relatively large effects on HbA1c via the erythrocytic pathway, compared to other genetic variants. The glycemic status of individuals carrying the HbA1c-lowering alleles might be underestimated by HbA1c levels, as lower HbA1c level is observed compared to their actual glycemic status due to their genetic influences on blood cell biology. In addition, several erythrocyte-related genetic variants of small effects may also have a combined impact on HbA1c in this regard. Thus, the influences of these non-glycemic-related variants need to be considered when the HbA1c test is performed to measure glycemic status.","['Biomedicine', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Pharmacology/Toxicology']"

During component usage, material-integrated measurement of mechanical forces can be used to monitor component stress and possibly predict failure, in context of condition or structural health monitoring (SHM). Integration of wired sensors can be problematic e.g. due to matrix weakening and wire sensitivity. This paper presents a novel approach for a wireless, material-integrated, battery-less sensor system for both temperature and strain measurement, during both the production process and component application. It uses a flexible printed circuit board, a full bridge strain gauge configuration, a digital temperature sensor and off-the-shelf RFID technology for data and energy transfer, and it is designed to simplify automatic placement during automated FRP production.

However, due to the involvement of certain levels of manual measurements, there still exists potential for improvements in the quantification of damage caused in a structure. Therefore, in this study, key-point point detection using fiducial markers is used to reduce the error in quantification of overall displacement and deformed profile of structural components (e.g., beams). This study demonstrates the use of a fiducial marker-based approach to quantify the deformation and bending profile in beam elements without physically disturbing the specimen. The visual fiducial marker (e.g., AprilTag) system has been extensively used in robotics for purposes ranging from localization of robots to increasing precision while tagging different objects in the robot’s surroundings. These AprilTag are attached to the surface of the specimen before loading. In this research, while the load is applied on the beam, the behavior of the specimen is then recorded by using a high-resolution digital camera during the experiment. Camera calibration using a checkerboard is performed to determine the extrinsic parameters (e.g., camera pose). With the help of attached AptilTags on the surface of the specimen, pixel values at the four corners and the center of each of the tags are detected during the experiment. These pixel locations are then used to get the corresponding world coordinate system by minimizing the loss function. Unlike normal bundle adjustment algorithms, camera parameters are treated as known parameters during the optimization process.

This health crisis has gotten worse with the new corona virus variant, which transmits even faster leading to critical shortage in hospital care beds and ventilators. To address this shortage, efforts are directed towards the fast construction of HCFs or conversion of non-medical facilities into temporary medical ones. However, there is a lack of structured support systems behind the decisions made. Disaster management has recently been growing in importance. It mainly addresses humanitarian logistics and emergency responses in case of disasters using various methodologies including operation research approaches. However, it did not tackle yet the emergency cases of pandemics and outbreaks. Accordingly, this paper presents the framework for a decision support system (DSS) that would help arrive at the best decision for fast provision HCFs in a timely and cost-effective manner amid health crises. The DSS consists of two modules: (1) first module determines the optimum structural system for fast construction of new HCFs considering the construction cost and duration and the associated life cycle costs, and (2) the second module determines the optimum selection of candidate non-medical facilities that can be converted into temporary HCFs considering multiple attributes. The proposed DSS will help policy makers respond quickly to pandemic crises and confine its disastrous impact on the society.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

Mining in this area goes back to the pre-Hispanic time; recorded history shows the first settlements of the Cañari culture and thru the Inca culture, and passing from the Spanish, American, and Canadian presence in the area up to modern times. Mining in this district has been in a constant transition from legal to illegal mining, technical and non-technical mining, prevailing activities in the present are illegal and non-technical over what is declared as the non-exploitation area under the city of Zaruma. This brings a series of problems among this land subsidence affecting the city cited as a cultural heritage cite; subsidence and collapses have accrued sporadically in the past, but in recent years (since 2017) this phenomenon has become a relatively consistent manner. In fact, December 15th, 2021, is the most recent sinkhole event resulting in the evacuation of over 300 people and the banning of over ten city blocks. For this reason, it is essential to find a quick and economical technique that can generate information about the spatial and temporal development of uncontrolled underground activities to improve risk management. In this work, the Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) technique, implemented in the SUBSIDENCE software, has been used to study terrain deformation related to illegal artisanal mining in Ecuador [ 1 ]. This work presents an up-to-date study of the monitoring and detection of subsidence phenomena in the city of Zaruma, as part of a collaboration project between local and international Universities allowing to detection and monitor surface deformations using DInSAR techniques as a tool applied to monitoring mining-related subsidence phenomena.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Time-domain methods have certain advantages compared to feature-domain methods. For example, statistical analysis may be more reliable, because the data dimensionality is often low and the number of data points large. In addition, the algorithm can be fully automated, because system identification is not necessary. In this paper, autocorrelation functions (ACF) replace the direct response measurements in the time-domain data analysis. ACFs have many advantages compared to the actual time history records. Their accuracy can be controlled by choosing a proper measurement period. Spatiotemporal correlation between the ACFs can be utilized, because they have the same form as a free decay of the system for stationary random processes. This makes it possible to manage with a smaller number of sensors. In the proposed method, a spatiotemporal covariance matrix is estimated using the ACFs of the training data from the undamaged structure under different environmental or operational conditions. Using novelty detection techniques, an extreme value statistics control chart is designed to detect damage. The direction of the largest discrepancy between the training and test data is used to localize damage. A numerical experiment was performed by simulating vibration measurements of a bridge deck under stationary random excitation and variable environmental conditions. The excitation or environmental variables were not measured. Damage was a crack in a steel girder. ACFs outperformed both direct measurement data and virtual sensor data in damage detection. Damage localization was successful in all cases.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Structural Materials', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

In Morocco’s case, the economic cost of air quality degradation is about 1.62% of GDP. Several studies have been conducted in air quality modeling to address the transport equation, and various numerical methods have been proposed. As a result, the research aims to compare six numerical method combinations used in the CHIMERE model. Preliminary air quality modeling results have revealed a discrepancy between the model and ozone observations, which is more likely due to the accuracy of the input data, such as emissions, meteorology, or land use data. The fastest combination, adv00 (Upwind-Upwind), on the other hand, provides a significant improvement, especially when a high spatial resolution is used, as in this study. The results can be used to guide the selection of a perfect algebraic polynomial interpolation for transport-dominated problems (advection).

A unique feature of these two lymphocyte receptors is their ability to bind a huge variety of different (pathogen) targets. This ability stems from six short loops in the binding domain that have hypervariable sequence due to genetic recombination mechanism. Particularly one of these loops, the third complementarity determining region (CDR3), has the highest sequence variability and a dominant role in binding the target. However, it has also been proven the most difficult to be modeled structurally, which is vitally important for downstream tasks such as binding prediction. This difficulty stems from its variability in sequence that both reduces the possibility of finding homologues and introduces unique structural features in the loop. We present here a general protocol for modeling such loops in antibodies and T-cell receptors.

The present study has devised an alternative to the current situation where trees are used as an indicator of the study area using air pollution tolerance index. To understand the impact of air pollutants on the tree species at the study area near the rural school. Studies are carried out to determine the physiological responses and biochemical changes in the selected tree species near the rural school. The objective is to identify tolerance and sensitive tree species near the rural school using the air pollution tolerance index (APTI). The leaf samples were collected from the selected tree species which were used to determine the APTI through the biochemical parameters such as pH, ascorbic acid, total chlorophyll and relative water content. The response of the plants toward air pollution is assessed through APTI; tolerant species found are Albizia saman and Azadirachta indica , intermediate species Ficus religiosa and Syzygium cumini are in the category of intermediate and Tectona grandis is found to be sensitive species. The selected species were subjected to API for evaluation of the performance of the tree to recommend it for the green belt development. Based on the APTI, biological and socioeconomic importance, the selected tree species were graded and categorized based on their performance. Thus APTI and API determination provides the combating efficiency of the selected tree species against air pollution based on its biochemical characteristics, biological and socioeconomic importance.

We investigated the pattern of failure, treatment and outcomes of progressing disease. Methods A prospective database of 374 PMP patients was reviewed, and 152 patients relapsing after complete CRS/HIPEC were identified. PMP was graded according to the Peritoneal Surface Oncology Group International (PSOGI) classification. Hematogenous metastases and non-regional lymph node involvement were considered as systemic metastases. Results Median follow-up was 78.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 66.7–90.4). PMP relapse involved the peritoneum in 112 patients, pleural cavity in 8, both peritoneum and pleura in 8, systemic sites in 11, and both peritoneum and systemic sites in 13 patients. Systemic metastases involved the lung ( n  = 14), liver ( n  = 4), distant nodes ( n  = 3), bone ( n  = 2), and both lung and distant nodes ( n  = 1). Survival after diagnosis of PMP relapse was independently associated with curative versus palliative treatment (hazard ratio [HR] 0.52, 95% CI 0.36–0.75; p  = 0.001) and PSOGI histology (HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.19–2.74; p  = 0.005), but was not influenced by site of failure ( p  = 0.444). Ten-year overall survival was 77.5% for 62 patients who had curative-intent surgery for PMP relapse, compared with 83.0% for 192 patients who had no recurrences ( p  = 0.154) and 26.1% for 90 patients who underwent palliative treatments ( p  = 0.001). Conclusions Relapse after CRS/HIPEC most commonly involves the peritoneum, but pleural recurrences and systemic metastases occur in a small but clinically relevant number of patients. In selected patients, surgical resection of recurrent disease can result in long survival, irrespective of sites of failure.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery']"

Second, we analyse the main factors affecting SOH. Combined with the investigations, 14 indicators of vehicle use behaviors, such as the average vehicle speed and charging depth, which affect the SOH of power battery, are determined as input variables, and the prediction model of battery SOH is established based on Back propagation (BP) neural network. Third, we use the two-step clustering method to divide user behaviors into two categories, namely the private car mode and the online car-hailing mode. Finally, we propose optimization strategies on user behaviors for different battery types of vehicles respectively, followed by confirming the results via deploying the SOH prediction model.

The methodological concept is to assign a subset of eigenpairs invariant to a postulated damage pattern in one structural subdomain at a time and then locate damage when the assigned eigenpairs, in an idealized setting, do not change due to damage. In real applications, where strict invariance is unattainable, damage is located when the discrepancy between the assigned eigenpairs from the reference and damaged configurations is minimized. The required output feedback is realized through offline signal processing of input-output data collected from open-loop testing, and the eigenstructure assignment is formulated with eigenvalues and left eigenvectors.

For guided-wave-based localisation strategies, information on the group velocity is required; therefore, determination of accurate dispersion curves is invaluable. However, for complex materials, the wave speed is dependent on the propagation angle. From experimental observations of dispersion curves, measured using a two-dimensional Fourier transform, a system identification procedure can be used to determine the estimated value and distribution for the governing material properties. Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling can provide a way of simulating samples from these distributions, which would require solving dispersion curves many times. By using a novel Legendre polynomial expansion approach, the computational cost of dispersion curve solutions is greatly reduced, making the MCMC procedure a more practical approach In this work, a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer is used to record the propagation of Lamb waves in a carbon-fibre-composite plates, and points on the dispersion curve are extracted. These observations are then fed into the MCMC material identification procedure to provide a Bayesian approach to determining properties governing Lamb wave propagation at various angles in the plate. The distribution of parameters at each angle is discussed, including the inferred confidence in the predicted parameters.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Here in what is now known as the United States, food apartheid manifests that history. To work toward food sovereignty and security means to carry the responsibility of acknowledging and fighting the unjust way food is manipulated for profit and moves throughout our communities while simultaneously building new, just pathways.","['Chemistry', 'Food Science', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general']"

To improve our knowledge of household strategies employed to survive in urban spaces, we conducted a household survey to examine the relationship between coping strategies,food insecurity and dietary diversity in the secondary cities corridor of Oshakati-Ongwediva-Ondangwa (OOO) in Northern Namibia. The data were collected from 853 households, using a cluster-stratified sampling design. Household food insecurity in the corridor was77%, while the mean dietary diversity was less than 5. These measures differed by coping strategy andfood sourcing mechanism. The most common coping strategy was to rely on less preferred and less expensive foods (67%). Rural–urban food transfers were another common strategy (55%), while some households grow some of their own food in rural areas (23%). Urban agriculture is very limited as are informal social protection strategies such as sharing meals, borrowing from neighbours and providing food to neighbours or other households in the community.","['Social Sciences', 'Human Geography', 'Urban Studies/Sociology', 'Public Policy', 'Sustainable Development', 'Environmental Policy', 'Sociology, general']"

This chapter focuses on placental development, morphology, and pathology while also investigating placental bed structure and function. Placental anomalies with regard to HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection and placental morphometric image analysis and its relevance for verification of placental pathology are explored. Since image analysis remains optional for routine diagnostic purposes, authentication of placental appraisal warrants the use of measurable predefined definitions. Immunohistochemical analyses of placental morphology and angiogenic, epithelial, and apoptotic mechanisms facilitate research into etiopathogenetic pathways involved in placental anomalies with a focus on discovering novel diagnostic foci.

The detection of defects is essential, especially in materials that could present discontinuities associated with the manufacturing processes, or after being mechanically loaded. The present work investigates the potential of full-field optical techniques to detect defects. These techniques could present an interesting alternative to specific techniques such as traditional ultrasound inspection or Laser Scanning Vibrometry (SLDV), which is very sensitive even at high frequencies. Specifically, 3D Digital Image Correlation (3D-DIC) is explored to detect inner defects. This full-field optical technique is based on measuring displacement and recent advances in camera resolution allows a high sensitivity. In this work, it is analysed different cantilever-beam specimens with different internal discontinuities. These specimens are made using additive manufacturing in order to control shape and size of discontinuities. Mode shapes are explored with 3D-DIC employing high-resolution cameras and a subsampling procedure to capture images. This procedure presents a high special resolution, unlike other approaches. Results are compared with those obtained by SLDV and simulations.

Determining this soluble metal in water has been a challenge to Marinduqueños as there is no water testing laboratory available. This research aims to develop a system that determines soluble Copper (Cu) in water through color reaction analysis of tannins. Specifically, it aims to develop a system that determines copper in water and evaluate the developed system through comparative analysis from laboratory results. An image processing box was prepared to record the color reaction of tannins to water solutions containing 0.5 to 5 ppm soluble copper. The recorded reactions were analyzed for their RGB channels. The RGB color values were then related to the copper concentrations. To assess the reliability of the system, water samples with unknown metal contents were tested using the system. Based on these procedures, it was found that copper produces green and blue colors, especially for the water solutions with 2.0 to 3.5 ppm of copper. It was concluded that the system can determine the soluble copper in water samples (from 0.5 ppm to 5 ppm), but calibration must be done using genetic algorithm optimization features and other ways such as machine vision. Relevant to analytic chemistry, it is recommended that titrimetric conditioning and use of the Sigmoid function be performed to improve color resolution.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Malaria is a part of the plasmodium group caused by single-celled microorganisms. This study proposes the use of ensemble model using the three regression algorithms that are linear regression, support vector machine (SVM), and auto-Arima techniques and comparing their results. Predictions of plasmodium virus cases are made with the use of linear regression, support vector machine, and auto-Arima algorithms. The accuracy of prediction is measured by calculating the explained variance score, mean squared error rate, and root mean squared error rate. Our aim is to get better prediction results compared to the individual algorithms by combining the results of these individual models. The proposed work determines the accuracy of linear regression, support vector machine, and auto-Arima and ensembles together to find the trend of prediction using simple Average. A comparison of performance among the three regression techniques indicated the SVM model performs the best and has small RMSE and MAE values.

A trade-off between accuracy and computational cost can be achieved by adopting deep learning-based approaches. This research demonstrates an alternative deep learning-based approach for predictive modeling of wave propagation signals within damaged structural elements. Our goal is to evaluate the wave propagation spatio-temporal solution matrix for a given crack depth and crack location within the structural element. In this framework, deep-learning-based surrogate modeling is proposed by utilizing a deep convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) to learn the wavefield representation and project it to a compressed domain called latent space. This latent space works as labels for a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) followed by DCAE. This process eliminates the need to solve the system’s governing equations each time, leading to significant savings in computational costs and making the method excellent for issues that require repeated model computations. In DCAE architecture, we integrated the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block which works as a channel-wise attention mechanism and enhanced the performance of the model. The DCAE with SE block achieved the very good reconstruction accuracy. This deep learning-based wave propagation predictive model can be a valuable resource for generating data for a given crack depth and location, which can be used for inverse formulations and various structural health monitoring (SHM) application.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

However, the barely visible impact damages (BVIDs) in CFRP laminates may cause a significant degradation in the performance, seriously affecting the safety of daily use. Hence, structural health monitoring (SHM) systems that can detect the BVIDs in mobilities are urgently needed. In this research, we attempted to establish a method to identify impact damages in mobility structures made of CFRP based on ultrasonic guided waves transmitted and received by macro fiber composites (MFCs). From the response signals, some damage-sensitive features, such as the time of flight (ToF) delay and the amplitude of A 0 mode, can be extracted to evaluate the impact damage. The relation between the impact damage size and the maximum ToF delay was investigated for three kinds of CFRP plates: woven, non-woven and hybrid laminates. As a result, it was found that the maximum ToF delay increases linearly with an increase in the damage size for all the CFRP laminates. Moreover, the amplitude of A 0 mode was found to be largely affected by the damage length in the wave propagation direction. This attenuation can be used to identify the extension direction of the impact damage as a complement of the ToF delay distribution.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Structural Materials', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

Due to their endogenous and/or exogenous origins, these volatiles can denominate many intrinsic and extrinsic effects. Exhaled volatile profiles are super dynamic in nature and their expressions may change from seconds to years. Exhaled volatile concentrations largely depend on normal or abnormal fluctuations in physiological and metabolic attributes. Minute or pronounced alterations in cardiorespiratory and other bronchopulmonary gas-exchange parameters due to simple changes in respiratory patterns, routes, and rhythms, posture, expiratory/inspiratory flow, and upper-airway resistance can immediately affect volatile profiles. Similarly, the subject’s age, gender, sexual orientation, metabolic state or status, diet, nutrition, therapy, lifestyle habits and habitats, menstrual phases, contraception, pregnancy, menopause, as well as any acute or chronic condition and comorbidities may cause transient or long-lasting differences in breath compositions. Applications of real-time mass spectrometric techniques along with alveolar sampling enabled us to frame fast occurring and continuous changes under diverse physio-metabolic conditions. Physio-metabolic conditions affected breath components more pronouncedly than the differential expression proposed as disease biomarkers in the literature. Investigations of such regulating factors helped us to develop the present state of the art for clinical breath sampling and analysis. Besides, assessments of ventilation and hemodynamics driven changes in exhaled volatiles have depicted potential for physio-metabolic monitoring.

Understanding the impact of ADT on various bridge decks built in different climatic regions allows the bridge owners to monitor the daily traffic closely and to efficiently allocate their funds for the rehabilitation of bridges. This paper attempts to study the impact of ADTs by calculating the deterioration rates of a variety of bridge decks that are made up of diverse materials and built in several climatic regions. Non-linear regression equations are developed using the time in condition rating mechanism to see how fast the bridge decks decline from an excellent condition to a satisfactory condition.

Since populist discourses have often used migrants and migrations instrumentally, one should clarify what populism, souverainism and the ‘spatialization of fear’ actually mean. In this sense, many European states have ambiguously wavered between the rejection of supranational entities (as in the case of the United Kingdom with the Brexit, or the first version of Marine Le Pen’s Front National ) and the desire to strengthen European borders, considered culturally homogeneous, against the ‘threat’ of foreigners arriving from Africa and Asia. Ever since the coronavirus emergency exploded, populism has been similarly ambiguous with regard to cities, which are sometimes considered the receptacle for all evil (and all diseases), while at other times they are a political model (with obvious reference to the Greek polis ) to be defended, once again, in the clash of civilizations that characterizes our era. If, in fact, there are many studies on the construction of the populist discourse at the national or supranational scale, less attention has been paid to the urban scale, which also plays a key role in the articulation between identity rhetoric, practices of confinement and spatial imagery. In this turbulent context, Palermo has also experienced some episodes, albeit not very well known, of populist anti-migrant rhetoric. Since the prevailing narrative for now, due to Covid-19, focuses on security obsessions, migrants have been linked to a stigma that configures them as carriers of dangerous diseases, not only at the national scale but also and especially at the urban level. By building on the existing scientific literature on populism, and through the use of a qualitative methodology based on critical discourse analysis, this contribution aims to outline the links between migration, populism and health emergencies, starting from a theoretical framework and then describing the specific case of Palermo, still subject to rapid changes.","['Economics', 'Urban Economics', 'Real Estate Management', 'Urban Studies/Sociology']"

Virtual reality tourism research so far has mostly looked at how current knowledge and theories can be used to help people have a good experience with VR apps. To look at reviews and blogs, the researchers used an inductive method. It turns out that virtual reality tourist experiences have common threads, like a short-lived sense of seclusion and the addictive power of virtual reality. More research is needed to learn more about addiction and social isolation so that we can better understand what causes them, how they work, and what they can do to us.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"
doi:10.1007/82_2021_240,en,A Guide to Preclinical Models of Zoster-Associated Pain and Postherpetic Neuralgia,OriginalPaper,"Reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes herpes zoster (HZ), which is commonly accompanied by acute pain and pruritus over the time course of a zosteriform rash. Although the rash and associated pain are self-limiting, a considerable fraction of HZ cases will subsequently develop debilitating chronic pain states termed postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). How VZV causes acute pain and the mechanisms underlying the transition to PHN are far from clear. The human-specific nature of VZV has made in vivo modeling of pain following reactivation difficult to study because no single animal can reproduce reactivated VZV disease as observed in the clinic. Investigations of VZV pathogenesis following primary infection have benefited greatly from human tissues harbored in immune-deficient mice, but modeling of acute and chronic pain requires an intact nervous system with the capability of transmitting ascending and descending sensory signals. Several groups have found that subcutaneous VZV inoculation of the rat induces prolonged and measurable changes in nociceptive behavior, indicating sensitivity that partially mimics the development of mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia seen in HZ and PHN patients. Although it is not a model of reactivation, the rat is beginning to inform how VZV infection can evoke a pain response and induce long-lasting alterations to nociception. In this review, we will summarize the rat pain models from a practical perspective and discuss avenues that have opened for testing of novel treatments for both zoster-associated pain and chronic PHN conditions, which remain in critical need of effective therapies.","['Biomedicine', 'Virology', 'Immunology', 'Human Physiology', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general', 'Biotechnology', 'Biomaterials']"

In fact, bridges and viaducts represent key components of the transportation network, and therefore they increasingly draw infrastructure managers’ attention. The present work is the result of a project carried out by Politecnico di Milano, consisting of a large experimental campaign conducted on a series of viaducts of the Italian railway network. The ensemble of structures under investigation is composed by 11 viaducts, for a total amount of spans equal to 138. According to a similarity criterion, the latter were subdivided into 8 groups, featured by different properties. Due to its transient nature, the experimental campaign was conducted by means of wireless accelerometers, and it consisted in the extraction of the main modal parameters of each analyzed viaduct span, as well as the characterization of the trains travelling on the line. Through the adoption of an operation modal analysis (OMA) technique, it was then possible to construct a large database of the dynamic features concerning the studied viaducts. This database may be exploited for future studies as an important baseline reference condition, by which potential outlier values may be captured, as a sign of damage occurrence among the monitored structures.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Structural Materials', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

Clinical dialogue is a conversation between health practitioners and their patients, with the explicit goal of obtaining and sharing medical information. This information contributes to medical decision-making regarding the patient and plays a crucial role in their healthcare journey. The reliance on note taking and manual scribing processes are extremely inefficient and leads to manual transcription errors when digitizing notes. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) plays a significant role in speech-to-text applications, and can be directly used as a text generator in conversational applications. However, recording clinical dialogue presents a number of general and domain-specific challenges. In this paper, we present a seq2seq learning approach for ASR transcription error correction of clinical dialogues. We introduce a new Gastrointestinal Clinical Dialogue (GCD) Dataset which was gathered by healthcare professionals from a NHS Inflammatory Bowel Disease clinic and use this in a comparative study with four commercial ASR systems. Using self-supervision strategies, we fine-tune a seq2seq model on a mask-filling task using a domain-specific PubMed dataset which we have shared publicly for future research. The BART model fine-tuned for mask-filling was able to correct transcription errors and achieve lower word error rates for three out of four commercial ASR outputs.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Artificial Intelligence']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-15758-5_80,en,Damage Index Implementation for Structural Health Monitoring,OriginalPaper,"Since the requirements for constructing more stable and durable structures are increasing, structural health monitoring (SHM) is getting more importance nowadays. SHM relies on various methods to monitor a specific structure even live online or through direct observation of some structural parameters to decide whether a structure is damaged or not. Besides the need of getting reliable updates about the structure status, the need of making it more affordable for all types of projects is getting decisive. One of the simple implementations that are used for this purpose is to employ wave excitation at certain position of the structural part of interest and to observe the response at another predefined location of this part. After that, the observed wave propagation signal is used to calculate the damage index (DI) parameter which can be implemented in different algorithms for monitoring the current status and possibly predicting the remaining reliable operation of the structure. The signal processing procedure implemented in this work is based on the wavelet decomposition of the wave signal for the purpose of determining the energy of the propagating wave. This research is done as a part of a larger project that will study the possibility of detecting damages in different structures in general and in massive structures in specific. The paper investigates the possibilities and benefits of implementing the DI metric for monitoring the structural condition. The method will be demonstrated through a case study. Several models will be invoked to clarify its applicability. For the sake of clarity, the implementation will be done on 2D models. In addition, a 3D example based on finite element modeling should give the scope of using DI in a general case.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis']"

Methods of repression have varied over time, but it is striking that strategies of open or tacit discrimination and expulsion of the Roma are still found in some contemporary policies of the older and transitional democracies, in EU Member States and countries that are candidates for EU membership. Of major concern is the fact that xenophobic statements and actions against the Roma often come from leading politicians or from national governments. Additionally, despite various international and regional human rights instruments, the ongoing structural discrimination that the Roma face has not yet been addressed within the existing legal framework. Many of the measures that have been proposed to address social exclusion and marginalisation are largely unenforceable; they tend to overlook the harsh living conditions, lack of access to public services, low level of education and embedded prejudice against the Roma. This paper addresses the human rights violability of cultures commonly marginalised in society. In many cases, although human rights protection regimes are enacted for certain cultures, the measures do not encompass groups that are non-dominant and territorially dispersed. The case of the Roma exemplifies not only this situation in respect of their language, cultural and educational rights in Spain and in North Macedonia, but also how the establishment and implementation of possible non-territorial autonomy (NTA) arrangements can help to overcome lasting discrimination. There is no unique model of NTA since it is applied differently in different contexts and circumstances. However, in essence, NTA arrangements can help minorities to enjoy cultural or other activities without territorial limitation. NTA can thus support the protection of territorially dispersed cultures and alleviate some of the harsh practices that they face.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Comparative Politics', 'Language Policy and Planning', 'Governance and Government', 'Political Science']"

The diseases related to the heart can bring your life to a halt. The increased cholesterol level in the body and chest pain can be an indicator of bad heart health. Heart attack is a major cause of casualty in today’s time. The unhealthy lifestyle along with the work culture which involves sitting on the desk for a long time has induced heart-related risk in human beings. The early prediction of heart diseases, the situation where a person may suffer from heart attack, can be helpful in saving lives. Modern technologies such as data analysis using data mining can help in early detection and diagnosis of heart-related diseases avoiding heart attacks. In this work, we propose a comparative feature selection followed by classification method to analyze heart attack dataset to predict whether that a person can suffer from heart attack or not. The “orange”—data mining tool has been used for this study. The machine learning models such as decision tree, support vector machine, and KNN have been used for analysis. The proposed method also determines the key features that are effective in predicting a patient with heart disease. The analysis of the result shows highest prediction accuracy: 85% support vector machine by considering top-ranked attributes including chest pain, thal rate, number of maximum heart rate achieved, and exercise-induced angina into consideration.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

In this work, a system that incorporates the determination of depression level from the facial emotions expressed by a student is proposed where he/she could be working in front of electronic gadgets like laptops for long hours, due to the lockdown situation. The FER2013 data is used to train the deep learning architecture, visual geometry group model with 16 layers (VGG-16) base model with some additional layers. The model has been used to classify the emotions and has acquired an accuracy of 87.76% on the FER2013 dataset. The emotions are then recognized live, monitoring the student through a Webcam. The multi-task cascade convolutional neural network (MTCNN) architecture has been used for detecting the face live. The depression level of the student is determined by calculating the depression coefficient. The dominant emotions in a depression state, the negative ones were captured quickly which helped in determining the depression level. Appropriate remedies are then suggested according to the depression level detected, to improve the student’s mood and also to maintain their mental stability. The calculation of the corresponding depression level in the student will help the faculty, counselor, parents, and friends to take necessary actions to bring the student back to his or her normal mental stage. The system could become more efficient when the activities of the student could be monitored and incorporated into the current system.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Structures and Information Theory']"

Hence, water that is used for agriculture, marine culture, human consumption, etc., should be in good condition to minimize the hazardous effect of water pollution on human health. Rapid unsustainable industrialization, improper huge waste disposal, excess amount fertilizer usage, etc., are responsible for the rapid deterioration of the water quality in rivers and other freshwater bodies. Manual continuous water quality measurement is risky, expensive, and time-consuming. Hence, it is essential to forecast the water quality using statistical time series models. In this paper, three widely used statistical multivariate techniques such as Vector Moving Average (VMA), Vector Auto Regression (VAR), and Vector Auto Regression Moving Average (VARMA), are investigated to forecast water quality parameters like Fecal Coliform (FC), Total Coliform (TC), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), and the associated Water Quality Index (WQI) of the Ganga River. Most of the previous methods worked on forecasting the future values based on past values of individual parameters without considering the interdependency among the water quality parameters. Here, correlation among each parameter is estimated. Subsequently, the future values of a parameter are estimated based on its previous values and the previous values of its correlated parameters. The proposed research work can help properly manage the water quality of the river Ganga by utilizing the forecasted results for the planning of the pollution control strategies. Finally, it helps improve the quality of human beings by minimizing the health issues caused by water pollution.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

The designed network contains the sensors connected to the ESP32 microcontroller towards the processing of LoRa modules (sensor nodes), which send data to the gateway using the frequency band, using the ‘The Things Network (TTN)’. The sensor collects the different particle matter in the air. The proposed network design has been implemented at St. Paul Street Auckland.

How Much is Enough?,OriginalPaper,"Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) represents the course of action of implementing a damage assessment strategy for engineering infrastructures. SHM systems can provide substantial aid towards the improvement of Offshore Wind turbines (OWTs) reliability, sustainability, and profitability. Usually, SHM system development is affected by three major concerns: the sensing technology, the associated signal analysis, and the interpretation algorithm. In this work, we focus on the relevance of the signal analysis on fatigue, being one of the most relevant damage sources. At some stage of the signal analysis process, analogue signals from strain transducers shall go digitized for computer analysis. In this phase, the engineer pursues the trade-off between gathering all the necessary information and storing the minimum data quantity. The sampling frequency adopted is paramount to this aim and can have substantial effects on the final lifetime estimated by damage accumulation rules. The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem is not well suited for minimum sampling frequency estimation in OWTs SHM. It allows recovering the frequency content of the original signal (bandwidth limited) yet does not guarantee correct reconstruction of its amplitudes (quantisation error). On top of that, the quantisation error is always on the non-conservative side of the lifetime estimation. We, therefore, provide examples showing that a ratio of the signal maximum “significant frequency” to the sampling frequency greater than or equal to ten (as opposed to two in the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem) is the rule of thumb to follow to avoid lifetime underestimation.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Various methods are developed for detection of impacts, which can be done in geometrically more complex structures. A number of challenges prohibits a further analysis of impacts, like the energy associated and the required action to avoid immediate or delayed catastrophic failure. The challenges include both the algorithms to reconstruct the energy, and the sensors capturing the response. In the current research, an impact identification algorithm is developed, using both Piezoelectric Wafer Active Sensors and optical sensors. Initially, drop weight impacts of various energies are applied on a homogeneous thin aluminium plate and on a quasi-isotropic thin carbon fibre reinforced plastic plate. The objective is to compare the performance of the various sensor methods and explore the abilities to reconstruct not only the location but also the impact energy. In a second stage, impacts are applied to a geometrically complex, full-scale aircraft horizontal tail plain component. Parallel to the experimental work, numerical models are developed to assist the reconstruction. The first results show that the optical fibres have potential, as the signal to noise ratio is high. However, the signals are not yet of sufficient quality to proceed to force or energy reconstruction and are below the performance known from piezoelectric sensors in a pitch catch setting.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

In this paper, the mechanical, electrically conductive, and self-sensing performances of SSWs reinforced UHPC were investigated. The modification mechanisms of SSWs to UHPC were revealed by microstructure, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and intrinsically electrical conductivity analysis. The results show that the 1.5 vol. % of SSWs can increase the flexural strength, flexural toughness of UHPC unnotched beams and equivalent flexural strength of UHPC notched beams by 103.2%, 146.5% and 80.0% respectively. Meanwhile, the dynamic impact toughness and dissipate energy of SSWs reinforced UHPC with the strain rate ranging from 94 /s to 926 /s are increased by 43.5% and 58.2%, respectively. The electrical resistivity is reduced by six orders of magnitudes and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy only shows small flat arcs in the first quadrant in UHPC containing 0.5 vol.% of SSWs in diameter of 20 μm. The gauge factor of UHPC reinforced with SSWs in diameter of 8 μm can reach up to 22.5, 94.9 and 43.6 under cyclic compression, monotonic compression and flexure, respectively. The microstructure analysis indicates that the modification effect of SSWs on UHPC results from the extensive network of SSWs in UHPC, the inhibition on micro-cracks propagation and the pull-out and stripping of SSWs under loading. SSWs reinforced UHPC has great potential for developing pre-cast structural elements or cast-in-place joints for prefabricated structures, which will achieve the monitoring for structural key positions and can be efficiently used for health monitoring and safety assessment of prefabricated structures driven by the sensing information of multifunctional concrete. This will further avoid the issue concerning high cost of large scale application of multifunctional concrete. In addition, the smart pre-cast structural elements can be reusable and replaceable. Therefore, developing SSWs reinforced UHPC for prefabricated structures can make infrastructures safer, more durable and sustainable.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The method is based on a mode-matching procedure in which the experimental dispersion curves of guided wave modes supported by the coupons are compared with those computed by a numerical model in which the bond strength is progressively updated until a match is achieved. Specifically, guided waves are generated in the coupons in the 0–250 kHz range by direct contact excitation with a wedge beam transducer. Their corresponding velocity field is recorded using infrared laser vibrometry. From the measured velocity arrays, the dispersion curves of several higher order modes are extracted and subsequently used to match a semi-analytical finite element model of the coupons. The updating procedure is based on two steps. In the first step, the dispersion data of a coupon with a known pristine bond are used to determine the orthotropic elastic coefficients of the composite laminae. In the second step, these coefficients are fixed and only the bond equivalent Young’s modulus is updated by using the experimental dispersion curves. Analyses performed on coupons with three different level of seeded contamination indicate that our proposed method can quantify their reduction with good accuracy, which makes the method suitable for the efficient non-destructive inspection of structural components.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Concerning selected energy poverty determinants, the main empirical findings derived from the estimations of a time-varying fixed-effects model, a true random-effects model and an inefficiency effects model under truncated-normal, point to a significant interaction between those same socioeconomic determinants and relevant measures of eco-efficiency. Thus, we can consider the results of the estimated regression frontiers of inefficiency effects model (truncated-normal), that in the period of the first Kyoto commitment (2008–2012), Sweden, Hungary, France, Latvia and Lithuania stand out in the TOP5 in terms of technical eco-efficiency, while in the second Kyoto period 2013–2018 in this TOP5, we have the same economies occupying the same position in the ranking, except the position of Lithuania that no longer belongs, being substituted in its position by Slovenia.

The number of buildings in which many natural resources are consumed during the construction phase and severe damage to the environment caused by the wastes generated is constantly increasing. The construction of green buildings can reduce these negativities caused by the construction. Environmental sustainability in Turkey is still in its infancy. The goal of this research is to define and rank sustainability indicators to evaluate green building production in Turkey as a tool for assessing sustainability. To evaluate green buildings, 12 criteria in four dimensions have been presented. The weights of the dimensions and criteria addressed in the assessment framework were determined using the novel fuzzy level-based weight assessment (LBWA), which can represent human reasoning. The results show that ecology and energy-saving are the most critical dimensions in evaluating green building production in Turkey while reducing waste and health are the least essential dimensions. Research output can be a valuable reference for green building builders in the country. It can serve as a guide to selecting and promoting optimal applications in green building products. In addition, the proposed framework can be adapted for countries that are similar to Turkey’s climate and environmental conditions.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Optimization', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory']"

The study considered dietary diversities and food security of households in four peri-urban settlements in South Africa through household surveys with 314 randomly selected households. Dietary diversity was generally low with high levels of food insecurity across the peri-urban sites, with male-headed households generally worse off than female-headed households. There was high dependence on food purchasing in all sites, although female-headed households were more likely than male-headed households to supplement food purchases with other food strategies such as urban agriculture, collection from open spaces and receiving donations. Food insecurity was associated with high poverty levels, unemployment and low education levels.

Arsenic (As) is a non-essential metalloid in plants that can build up to toxic levels. As-contaminated soil remediation ought to be sustainable, low-cost, and applicable in the most vulnerable low-to-middle income countries. Phytoremediation is an aesthetically appreciable and successful approach that can be used for As decontamination using the best approach(es) and the most promising plant(s). On the other hand, Phytoremediation lacks the requisite speed, and the stress generated by As often can reduce plants’ ability to remediate. To solve these faults, we need to supplement plants’ potential with appropriate contemporary science means, such as microbial treatments and plant genetic modification, in order to reduce As stress and increase As accumulation in phytoremediator plants. According to the literature, integrated techniques like phytobial, constructed wetlands employing As-resistant microorganisms with vegetation activities have not been substantially researched. For As remediation, integrated phytoremediation techniques with practical application and reliability are seen to be the most promising. Further technology improvements would aid in exploring literature review gaps in various techniques, guiding us toward As phytoremediation sustainability and perfection. This chapter describes how arsenic concentrations, speciation, absorption, bioavailability, uptake, transport, phytotoxicity, and arsenic detoxification in plants may all be linked. This chapter aimed to provide insight into recent breakthroughs in phytoremediation technologies for overcoming arsenic poisoning in ecosystems. Aspects such as the current and future use of assisted phytoremediation approaches are also discussed.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Earth Sciences, general', 'Geography, general']"

The existence of modern slavery which has re-emerged is an important concern to study because slavery is anti-development. Moreover, Islam seeks to abolish slavery, so that modern slavery should no longer occur in Islamic countries, including Indonesia. This research is conducted using a quantitative descriptive method, with Partial Least Square Method and data from Indonesia in particular since Indonesia is a country with the largest Muslim population in the world. This research is important to be carried out since this subject has never been studied quantitatively. The findings of this study, which are based on the discussion of existing data indicate that quantitatively, in the short term there is no impact on the distribution of Islamic social finance funds, in the form of zakat, infaq, sadaqah on modern slavery of children in Indonesia. Thus, Indonesia, considering that the existence of modern slavery is anti-development as marked by its effect on welfare, as an Islamic country with the largest population in the world should pay more attention to the eradication of modern slavery of children.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

The traditional visual inspection techniques often fail to detect delamination in composite structures. Guided Lamb waves are increasingly being applied for the identification of delamination in these structures. Scanning laser Doppler vibrometry can measure the full wavefield of guided Lamb waves, such full wavefield contains rich information about defects. In this research work, a novel deep learning-based semantic segmentation technique is applied for delamination identification on full wavefield data. A big dataset of full wavefield images resulting from the interaction with delamination of random shape, size, and location was utilised and fed into the proposed deep learning model. The main motive of this research work is to investigate the applicability of deep learning-based approach for delamination identification in composite structures by using only the animations of guided Lamb waves. It is verified that the performance of the proposed deep learning model is good. Moreover, it enables better automation of identification of delamination, which can further produce damage maps without the intervention of the user. Furthermore, the developed deep learning model also indicates the capability of generalising well to the experimental data.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

We employed a recurrent neural network with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and machine learning to identify the sepsis in its early stage. Sepsis can become a life-threatening disorder caused by the body’s response to infection, which results in tissue destruction, organ failure, and death. Every year, around 30 million people get sepsis, with one-fifth of them dying as a result of the disease. Early detection of sepsis and prompt treatment can often save a patient’s life. With the use of a Deep neural network, predict whether or not a patient has Sepsis Disease based on his or her ICU data. The objective of this study is to use physiological data to detect sepsis early. Patients’ data, such as vital signs, laboratory results, and demographics, are used as inputs. For the inference phase, we employed an LSTM to determine the best training hyperparameters and probability threshold. In this paper, an LSTM-based model for predicting Sepsis in ICU patients is proposed. We created a data pipeline that cleaned and processed data while also identifying relevant predictive characteristics using RF and LR approaches and training LSTM networks. With an AUC-ROC score of 0.696, RF is our top conventional classifier.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-07258-1_106,en,Exploiting Sparseness in Damage Characterization: A Close Look at the Regularization Techniques,OriginalPaper,"The idea of exploiting sparseness in under-determined damage characterization problems is not new, and regularizations techniques that tend to promote sparseness, such as L1-norm minimization, have been investigated in the last ten years or so. Although various claims of merit have been made, two interconnected issues put these claims into question, and this paper brings some attention to the matter. The first is that the relationship between the structural parameters and the modal features previously considered has been linear and to ensure that the premise was closely realized, only very small damage severities have been considered. The second issue, intimately related to the first, is the fact that the noise, which has been typically taken as small relative to the “change in the features”, is then unrealistically small. In problems where the damage is sufficiently large, the nonlinear dependence of the features on the parameters cannot be generally discarded. It is found that the attainable performance is much less “impressive” that what has been often claimed. The paper also examines the potential merit of using Lp-norm (0 < p < 1) minimization, instead of L1-norm minimization which, to the knowledge of the writers, has not been previously examined in damage characterization research. In this case we also find that, contrary to claims made in other areas, this norm does not lead to any general improvement over the performance attained by minimizing the L1-norm.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The purpose of a water supply distribution system or network is to provide water to consumer with adequate pressure and quality. The quality must be healthy and standards in terms of chemical and biological standards. Chlorine is used as the most common disinfectant in municipal drinking water supply networks due to its high efficiency and economy. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of environmental temperature on residual chlorine, turbidity, TOC and HPC in Abadan, Iran, WDN, during summer and winter seasons. In this cross-sectional study, according to the water supply maps, the 232 samples from different point of WDN were analyzed to measurement of free residual chlorine, total organic carbon (TOC), Turbidity (NTU), and heterotrophic plate count (HPC) (cfu/100 ml), based on the standard methods for examination of water and wastewater (APHA). Samples were collected from effluent of water treatment plant to distribution system according to the Cluster sampling model. Regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between variables. Results show that temperatures in Abadan typically range from 29 to 46 °C at summer and 12 to 27 °C in winter. Statistical analyzes show that as the ambient temperature increased, the free residual chlorine in the distribution network from the water treatment plant decreased to the end of the distribution network and reached zero at some end points ( R 2  = 0.97). Also TOC, Turbidity (NTU), and HPC (cfu/100 ml) showed a significant increase with increasing environmental temperature in distribution network ( P  < 0.05). According to the results of this study, in cities with high seasonal air temperatures, due to changes in the water quality of the distribution network, it is necessary to take re-chlorination, change the coagulation and flocculation process of surface water treatment plants in, and continuous monitoring of WDN in hot seasons.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Environment, general', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Water, general']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-19467-2_2,en,Marine Solid Pollution—From Macroplastics to Nanoplastics,OriginalPaper,"It is not surprising that we are interested in plastics as one of the most prominent polluting agents of the twenty-first century. We have gone from producing less than 10 million tons in the 1960s to more than 300 million in the 2010s. That plastic has had time to distribute itself, fragment and enter food chains of the oceans. Studies related to the three phenomena are now one of the main objectives of various research projects and groups around the planet. The first is understanding how fragmentation is increasing the volume of macro and microplastics, how they are dispersed at the oceanic and local level, and what their chemical characteristics are. In line with these observations and quantifications, we have to understand what influence they have on organisms and how we can reduce their concentration. For example, the displacements of macroplastics are modeled relative to their dispersion according to global and local currents, giving importance to the phenomena of fouling and fragmentation, as well as understanding how the creation of microplastics is heterogeneous according to latitude, water temperatures or seasonal conditions. One of the biggest problems is, without a doubt, the chemical, morphological and size classification of plastics, especially micro and nanoplastics. This topic is crucial, as is the standardization of the measures that we consider to classify them in one way or another. This topic has been largely discussed during the last decade, and in this chapter there are cues to understand that the consensus is very close. Other issues are still pending in the complex agenda of the understanding of these pollutants. For example, the adherence of certain types of elements such as heavy metals is a relevant issue on which much information is lacking. But it is not the only knowledge gap that we have. Dynamics in the water column and in the sediment is also a main issue, since this sediment is a sink for microplastics and nanoplastics that is continually disturbed by organisms from the meiofauna. Some of these microplastics become airborne, and their range from likely emission sources is still poorly understood. The understanding of these fluxes from the land-river to the sediments passing through the water column is one of the main challenges to solve the problems derived from the presence of such macro, micro and nano items. Marine organisms are the ones that, apparently, are the most affected by this increase in solid contamination, especially microplastics. Today they are found at any latitude, from the poles to the equator, even in places as surprising as sea ice or abyssal depths. In fact, microplastics are found in very remote places, interfering with the diet of various planktonic and benthic organisms. There are many questions to be resolved, among others, how temperature affects the retention of microplastics in organisms, or which are the most vulnerable species. And we have to understand one important issue: many of those marine organisms affected by micro and nano plastics are part of our diet. Therefore, understanding the rate of transmission in food chains in general and in our consumption in particular is a major issue. That is why we looked for solutions, such as the use of bioremediators (active suspension feeders such as sponges, sea squirts, etc.) in areas where the abundance of microplastics is especially high. Bacteria are also beginning to be used as active decomposers of microplastics, a solution that could help eliminate a large amount of this material about which we still have too many knowledge gaps regarding the health of ecosystems and our own health. The synergy of efforts to understand all these different variables is crucial. During the next decade we do have to solve this plastic problem, with coordination, standardization and the application of different tools to execute the solutions of different associated problems.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"

The authors found that Bangladesh’s prison system functions primarily as a punishment centre with inadequate amenities making prison life inhuman for life-sentenced prisoners. The dearth of opportunities for rehabilitation exacerbates the difficulties faced by life-sentenced prisoners both during and after their incarceration. This chapter concludes that life imprisonment should be for a set period, after which release should be routinely and effectively considered, providing life-sentenced prisoners with a genuine prospect of release, even if it is not given right away. Furthermore, life imprisonment should be constructive, allowing life-sentenced prisoners to live a healthy and dignified life whilst exercising all their inherent rights, including conjugal rights. Immediate essential amendments to existing legislation are required to ensure constructive prison experiences for life-sentenced prisoners. In the longer term, a multidisciplinary sentencing management system is recommended to be introduced by enacting comprehensive legislation, whilst adhering to international norms, to facilitate a constructive prison experience for life-sentenced prisoners in Bangladesh.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Human Rights', 'Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law', 'Social Justice, Equality and Human Rights']"

Through compressive strength tests, the mechanical strengths were observed with the increasing of curing age, but the strengths were reduced with the increment of wasted steel in the mixture. 10% of wasted steel substitution gave the optimum mechanical strength values where the values slipped drastically for 15% wasted steel substitution and above. Acid–base reaction between cement and steel coating in the concrete mixture generated hydrogen gas, which reduced the compressive strength. The higher the percentage of steel in the concrete mixture, the weaker the mechanical strengths were obtained.

Methods This study identified patients with atypical ductal/lobular hyperplasia (ADH/ALH), lobular carcinoma in situ, (LCIS) or both evaluated at our high-risk clinic. Patients were categorized as having received screening mammography (MMG) alone vs. MMG and breast MRI (MMG+MRI). Inverse probability weighting based on propensity scores (PS) representing likelihood of MRI use was applied to Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses to determine cancer detection and biopsy rates by screening group. Results Among 908 eligible patients, 699 (77%) patients with available follow-up data were analyzed (542 with ADH/ALH and 157 with LCIS). Of the 699 patients, 540 (77%) received MMG alone, and 159 (23%) received MMG + MRI. The median follow-up period was 25 months, during which a median of two MRIs were performed. After PS-weighting, the characteristics of each screening group were well-balanced with respect to age, race, body mass index (BMI), menopausal status, breast density, family history, HRL type, and chemoprevention use. The 4 year breast cancer detection rate was 3.6% with both MMG alone and MMG+MRI ( p  = 0.89). The breast biopsy rates were significantly higher with MMG+MRI (30.5% vs12.6%; hazard ratio [HR], 2.67; p  < 0.001). All breast cancers were clinically node-negative and pathologic stage 0 or 1. Among five cancers in the MMG+MRI group, two were MRI-detected, two were MMG-detected, and one was detected on clinical exam. Conclusions Screening MRI did not improve cancer detection, and cancer characteristics were favorable whether screened with MMG alone or MMG + MRI. These findings question the benefit of MRI for patients with HRL, although longer-term follow-up study is needed.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery']"

There are many factors that contribute for such incidents and Behaviour of the workforce is one of them. Many organizations initiate and run several Behaviour-based safety programmes with the help of their site level teams. An effective implementation of a BBS programme can do the job of improving safety culture, because of the fact that, it involves the core workforce in the safety to the maximum extent. Maturity and awareness of workforce towards such BBS programmes is often neglected and is not considered as an area of improvement. This project aims to show the significance of behaviour maturity and its awareness of the workforce on the effective implementation of existing BBS programme using DMAIC framework. The study analyses the Behaviour data of unsafe acts reported and documented in first three quarters of the FY19-20, i.e. (APR 2019-Dec2019) and intends to find the critical, most common and repetitive unsafe work behaviours. This study includes a detailed survey of the target population, who are identified based on the criticality and repeatability of their Behaviour violations and are available in the organization. This survey analyses the maturity and awareness of the employees with respect to the Organization EHS Behaviour Standards and ongoing BBS programme. An inference made out of the survey interactions are recorded and documented for further improvement in the implementation of such programmes. The recommendations are given in the form of CAPA, based on the identified gaps in the maturity, awareness and implementation of current BBS programme.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Fire Science, Hazard Control, Building Safety', 'Safety in Chemistry, Dangerous Goods']"

In this work, a cure monitoring method based on electrical impedance ( $$\bar{z}$$ z ¯ ) measurements is presented. The electrical impedancemetry method enables us not only to monitor the degree of cure, but also to detect any faults at different stages of manufacturing of composite laminates. According to reference signatures, curing processes could be controlled, resulting in cost savings and quality improvements of composites for aeronautics. In this study, the proposed approach does not require a dedicated sensor as the functionalized composite is used as a sensor of its own state for self-sensing purpose. It has been previously shown [ 1 – 3 ] that thermomechanical and rheological measurements can be used as references of critical points to be monitored such as liquefaction, gelation, and vitrification of the matrix. During curing, these critical points but also faults could be detected using the presented approach. A first bench was developed using an electrical impedance analyzer (Hioki IM3570). This apparatus is expensive, bulky and monochannel thus a new home-made low-cost multi-channels bench has been developed. It would enable us to measure surface or bulk impedance changes of CFRP laminates in real time not only for cure monitoring but also for mechanical monitoring purpose.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

This paper, part of OWI-lab’s research activities within the SafeLife-Infrabel project, presents a fatigue survey on four months of strain measurements of a steel railway bridge in Belgium, comprising 98 Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs). This study aims to develop a data-driven case/event detection scheme including measurements and operational data (e.g., train type and passage time). The first objective is to develop a Python package to separate the events by automatically selecting the train passage events from the strain time series to analyze them and also reduce the dataset size. Over the studied period, a total of 5000 events were detected. Then, the available operational data is complemented with properties estimated from the strain measurements, including the axle number, speed, and direction. Finally, the relation between the fatigue damage and different train features is studied by calculating the attributed fatigue damage using the Rainflow cycle counting method and the Palmgren-Miner rule. A notable damage difference existed between freight and passenger trains. In addition, the damage difference between loaded and empty freight trains was completely distinguishable, while the effect of occupancy was not very visible in passenger trains. Axle number had the highest impact among the passenger trains and had linear relation with damage. Also, the difference in fatigue damage between various types of passenger trains was less distinctive. Finally, the speed and direction affected the damage very slightly.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Mass layoffs and reductions/reorganizations in terms of work engagements followed. This labor market’s unexpected transformation has awakened anxiety among all employees, mainly among the young, millennial generation which has faced a crisis of this magnitude for the first time in their working life. The research aimed to examine the current relationship between job insecurity and organizational commitment from this age cohort perspective, whose representatives tend to withhold their devotion to organizations which proved to be incapable of protecting their work positions in crisis times. The main research hypothesis, created as an extension of knowledge from previous research [ 11 , 32 , 47 ], assumed that from the perspective of employed millennials, job insecurity has a statistically significant negative impact on the commitment level they nurture towards the organizations they are part of. The theoretical part of the research encompassed the content analysis method for relevant national/foreign literature overview, while the empirical research part engaged the survey method via an online questionnaire released during 2021. The main research hypothesis was tested by examining a sample of 99 millennials employed in the Republic of Serbia.

By propagating uncertainty from a predictive model for structural response (strain) under unknown loading, a more robust assessment of the damage state of a structure is enabled. Although these black-box models have previously shown good results for quasi-static problems, dynamic behaviour is difficult to predict in this way. Explored here is a promising and novel means of accounting for this, by integrating physical knowledge specifically through the GP kernel. The impact of this on accuracy of fatigue damage prediction is shown to be significant and the damage variance from a probabilistic perspective is reduced substantially.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

However, there are limitations to FIB as accurate indicators of the presence of pathogens of concern, such as Cryptosporidium , as well as in the time-delay in FIB measurement. The objective of this work was to improve microbial water quality assessments by using data-driven approaches to predict day-to-day FIB, Escherichia coli ( E. coli ), and Cryptosporidium spp. concentrations based on simple water quality measures and weather data that can be monitored in real-time. To achieve this, we investigated the applicability of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs), an Artificial Intelligence-type algorithm that can provide probabilistic predictions using distinct data sources. Compared to other standard prediction methods, BBNs were observed to improve performance significantly and achieved greater than 75% accuracy for predicting FIB and E. coli concentrations. Following success in predicting FIB, predictability of Cryptosporidium , one of the major contributors to worldwide waterborne disease, was then investigated. One of the major challenges of modelling this parasite is dealing with a high number of non-detects and sparse data. Applicability of novel data augmentation and oversampling algorithms, such as the Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Algorithm (ADASYN), was investigated to improve the prediction model's performance. Leveraging the capability of the ADASYN significantly improved prediction performance of Cryptosporidium level presence, with 65% accuracy. The approach presented in this study can address the challenges of limited and time-delayed microbial water quality information and can be used to improve risk-based management and monitoring of water sources.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

Three scenarios of preoperative preparations in the OR were simulated, each of which was followed by facilitated debriefing sessions. These sessions consisted of three phases: description, analysis, and application. To achieve the highest standard of care and ensure patient safety in the OR, it is necessary for Norwegian OR nurses to be proficient in the responsibilities and functions of both circulating and scrub nurse roles, including teamwork and non-technical skills. With respect to the three domains of educational purpose—qualification, socialization, and subjectification—the simulation activities aimed to enhance knowledge, ability, and understanding of non-technical skills in the OR, thus socializing the students to their new profession while also encouraging their independence. The Norwegian adaptation of the Scrub Practitioners’ List of Intraoperative Non-Technical Skills (SPLINTS-no) behavioral rating tool was used by the students for reflection and learning throughout the teaching activities. The majority of participants agreed or fully agreed that the three phases of debriefing were helpful for their learning.

Modal analysis has been widely used to structure optimization in the design stage, damage detection and structural health monitoring or condition monitoring. According to whether need artificial exaction, the modal analysis techniques can be categorized as experimental modal analysis and operational modal analysis. Conventional experimental modal analysis has to measure the excitation and corresponding response in the meantime, while operational modal analysis measure system’s response only during normal operating condition. Therefore, operational modal analysis also called output-only modal analysis methods, which have developed dramatically in recent decades because it is promising as means to achieve structural online monitoring, which is highly desirable for critical mechanical system, important buildings and bridges, etc. This paper made a brief review of the development of popular operational modal analysis techniques and their applications in condition monitoring.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements']"

In civil engineering, it is necessary to digitize the physical space by sensing. Complete IoT using a lot of sensors can realize cost-saving inspection and monitoring for important infrastructure such as bridges. In the transitional period of IoT, installation of sensors on bridges is cost-labor. On the other hand, there is “On-going Monitoring” that uses a sensor installed on a going vehicle. Spatial Singular Mode Angle (SSMA) shows the possibility of detecting bridge damage as screening index, however, the effect of noise generated in measurement on an actual bridge has not been evaluated enough in previous study. Noise for SSMA can be defined as signal noise or measurement error such as GPS error. Since SSMA can be assumed as a mechanical index based on signal analysis technology, it is an effective for evaluating the features of latent space and inference results of AI. This study carried out the experiment on four bridges (PC/RC has three and steel has one). The addition of noise is reproduced by addition of random noise or smoothing. The behavior of SSMA in data feature changes are evaluated by these comparative verifications.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The aim of this study is to report outcomes of emergency laparotomy in Greece and to compare them with the results of the National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA). Methods This is a multicentre prospective cohort study undertaken between 01.2019 and 05.2020 including consecutive patients subjected to EL in 11 Greek hospitals. EL was defined according to NELA criteria. Demographics, clinical variables, and post-operative outcomes were prospectively registered in an online database. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of post-operative mortality. Results There were 633 patients, 53.9% males, ASA class III/IV 43.6%, older than 65 years 58.6%. The most common operations were small bowel resection (20.5%), peptic ulcer repair (12.0%), adhesiolysis (11.8%) and Hartmann’s procedure (11.5%). 30-day post-operative mortality reached 16.3% and serious complications occurred in 10.9%. Factors associated with post-operative mortality were increasing age and ASA class, dependent functional status, ascites, severe sepsis, septic shock, and diabetes. HELAS cohort showed similarities with NELA patients in terms of demographics and preoperative risk. Post-operative utilisation of ICU was significantly lower in the Greek cohort (25.8% vs 56.8%) whereas 30-day post-operative mortality was significantly higher (16.3% vs 8.7%). Conclusion In this study, Greek patients experienced markedly worse mortality after emergency laparotomy compared with their British counterparts. This can be at least partly explained by underutilisation of critical care by surgical patients who are at high risk for death.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgery', 'Abdominal Surgery', 'Cardiac Surgery', 'General Surgery', 'Thoracic Surgery', 'Vascular Surgery']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-13264-3_14,en,The Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol on Liability and Redress to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety,OriginalPaper,"The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (hereafter: Cartagena Protocol) was adopted on 29 January 2000 as a supplementary agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity and entered into force on 11 September 2003. The Cartagena Protocol pursues the goal of reconciling the economic interests of the biotechnology industry with environmental concerns and, by doing so, is supposed to provide a framework to meet the respective needs of trade and environmental protection with respect to the rapidly growing global biotechnology industry. On the one hand, the Protocol is designed to enable the access to and transfer of technologies regarding the development and use of living modified organisms (LMOs) which are seen to potentially provide considerable socio-economic benefits. Such a typically commercial use may be contained in controlled settings, or involve the release of the organisms into the environment for application in agricultural or industrial production-processes or products. This entails serious risks of environmental damage. The Cartagena Protocol, therefore, seeks to ensure the development of appropriate procedures to enhance the safety of biotechnology, to reduce potential threats to biological diversity, taking also into account the risks to human health. It does so with a particular focus on transboundary movements. The reasons cited for the need for a specific liability regime regarding LMOs and the potential damage they may cause relate to many of the specific problems associated with such organisms: For example, once LMOs are released, the transgenes cannot be easily recalled or removed from the environment. There may be possible long-term effects, whereby damage may only appear over time or even increase incrementally over time. Furthermore, some of the difficulties common to liability in an environmental damage context become acute when dealing with LMOs, such as in proving damage and causation, valuing areas damaged by LMOs, which may be not as well developed under existing liability regimes, as well as defining the affected persons who can bring a claim, e.g., on behalf of the environment or affected communities.","['Law', 'International Environmental Law', 'Environmental Economics']"

As a result of the spread of the coronavirus, various medical institutions found it necessary to acquire more mechanical ventilators, causing an increase in the demand for their production. The production, distribution, and use conditions present a potential medium- and long-term risk concerning the equipment’s operation, safety, and effectiveness. In the face of the pandemic, the care that must be implemented to guarantee patient safety, the effectiveness of the equipment, and the quality of care, should be a high priority. This paper presents a first approach to analyzing the causes that can lead to a potential state of obsolescence in mechanical ventilators used to care for patients with Covid19. We collected information about mechanical ventilators, identified the factors that may cause a failure in the device, applied Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis for three possible outcomes, and compared the results with the expert opinion of clinical engineers. We found a total of 30 factors and classified them into associated, operation, and external concerning the ventilator. The results show that the factors found are associated with the technical field. The knowledge of the operation of the equipment’s subsystems and familiarity with its components is essential. The contrast with the expert opinion and the non-inclusion of factors such as the economic ones led to the development of more in-depth work on this topic.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering', 'Bioinformatics']"

The ultrasonic method is very sensitive to environmental conditions and material property changes, which might be caused by prestress losses and loading effects on the bridge. However, it remains a challenge to identify the damage mechanisms causing structural property changes from the above-mentioned factors influencing ultrasonics. The focus of this contribution is to investigate the correlation between ultrasonic velocities and temperature by the coda wave interferometry (CWI) analysis. Long-term monitoring of a prestressed concrete bridge model under field conditions was carried out to observe the effect of temperature. The homogeneous change in concrete caused by temperature was revealed by applying the CWI method. The threshold value of the best correlation coefficients for the linear regression of temperature and ultrasonic velocity changes was also studied. Experimental assessment will provide a ratio for temperature correction to evaluate the prestressing force decrease and its consequences on crack opening or extension.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

A post-processing methodology is presented, able to derive two-dimensional displacement configurations of multi-span bridges with properly defined error bounds, using both ascending and descending SAR acquisitions. The bounds are estimated by considering both random and systematic errors, accounting for the orientation of the bridge with respect to the Line-Of-Sights of the satellites, the hypothesized deformation plane and the accuracy of the measurements. The proposed procedure has been applied to the case study of the Albiano-Magra Bridge in Italy, collapsed on April 8th 2020. The results, referred to the monitoring period 2015–2020, highlight anomalies in the displacements of the first two spans and abutment of the East side, observed during the three years preceding the failure, thus providing information on the possible cause of collapse. A numerical model of the bridge, based on the Applied Element Method (AEM), was developed in order to simulate the progressive collapse of the structure subjected to the settlements derived by monitoring data and to verify the hypothesis on the kinematics and its causes.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

While monitoring data account for normal operational conditions of the undamaged structure, numerical data are often confined to scenarios that seldom occur in the lifespan of the bridge, like extreme temperature events or damage, although previous research of the authors showed it can also be used to augment the data acquired under regular service. This paper presents a hybrid approach for damage identification and applies it to Z-24 Bridge. To enable the classification of damage, supervised learning algorithms are employed. Unlike unsupervised learning, which relies on unassigned data and is suited for novelty detection, supervised learning uses labeled data corresponding to undamaged and damaged scenarios of the structure, enabling the transition from damage detection and localization to damage type and severity. A hybrid database is constructed using monitoring and numerical data corresponding to undamaged scenarios and numerical data corresponding to damage scenarios. The damage scenarios comprise various degrees of settlement of a bridge pier and a landslide near the same pier. Several common supervised learning algorithms are trained with the hybrid data and a comparison of the results is provided.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Using Storytelling to Enhance Digital Legal Experiences,OriginalPaper,"Most legal content and procedures turn out to be so complex for citizens. Many of these are found in laws, decrees, statutes, and regulations considered legal artifacts. To access legal services, citizens require a lawyer’s assistance. So, how can an average citizen - a non-lawyer - access legal services without advanced knowledge or a lawyer? One possibility to bring citizens closer to judicial services is the design of legal interfaces. These interfaces serve as a medium between users and artifacts. The Rapporteur is a proposal for a legal interface to visualize health guardianship files. This interface is built from Storytelling, data visualization, and Legal Design principles. The result shows a proposal for constructing Storytelling for health tutelas actions in Colombia. The aim is to improve the legal experience of citizens who want to compose a tutela by generating new transparent and reliable legal interfaces.","['Architecture / Design', 'Industrial Design', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Digital/New Media']"

Therefore, a multi-disciplinary systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guideline to identify papers relevant for selecting appropriate methodologies that can be applied to build decision-support tools for resilient cities. This paper presents a list of 109 key references, selected from 8,737 records found from the searches, and identified major research themes, fundamental design interventions, and computer modelling techniques. We extracted six groups of interventions categorised by different scales of action: from an individual, crowds (social distancing and travel-related interventions), to a building, a neighbourhood/district, and a city. In addition, there are three sorts of computational modelling approaches, i.e., computer simulation, statistical models, and AI algorithms. Most of the studies developed models for predictive purposes, and 28% of the modelling studies built models for descriptive purposes. This work intends to empower urban designers and planners to overcome and get prepared for unpredictable disasters in pursuit of resilient and smart cities, particularly in the post-pandemic world. This review enables them to quickly find relevant papers as well as suitable methodologies and tools for a particular research purpose.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Public Policy', 'Arts']"

Many advancements have been made in the field of SHM over the past years such as the use of wireless sensors, implementation of compressed sensing, and event-based monitoring. These advancements are all pursued with the combined goal of collecting relevant data from the structure in a cost-effective manner, as well as taking into account the limitations placed on the system including size, energy consumption, safety, and bandwidth. Developments in wireless sensor systems enable greater coverage of structure monitoring since wired systems are costly to install. For wireless systems, it is ideal to use as little power as possible to process signals to reduce the sensor battery use and costly battery replacement. Previous research has focused on compressive sensing to reduce the size of data transferred while maintaining high-fidelity signal analysis. More recent work has focused on event-based monitoring, which collects data based on non-uniformly spaced triggers. Both compressive sensing techniques and event-based monitoring focus on improving sampling for multi-sensor systems, but are restricted to lower sampling rates or are prone to missed events. In order to further advance the application of compressive sensing techniques and event-based monitoring, this project will focus on triggering schemes for multi-sensor systems with signals above the Nyquist frequency of the individual sensors, assuming the signal is present across all sensor recordings. The problem with detecting frequencies above the Nyquist frequency is that the signals will alias and show up as a disguised frequency. Using existing sensors to determine the true frequencies of the signal requires a new method of detection. Multiple sensors were placed around a structure of interest and the optimal time delay of each sensor was determined through simulation and affirmed by experimentation.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

Next, we review the performance characteristics of public, multi-tenanted data centers, including the concept of noisy neighbors. If a particular VM does excessive I/O or memory accesses, then other VMs running on that same server will experience a slowdown in their access of the same physical resource. This results in a performance variation experienced by a VM user over time. Such factors impact run times of users’ applications and result in different costs to finish a task. Cloud users want to maximize their performance and/or minimize their costs. We look at various monitoring tools, to manage the user costs. Since a majority of data in the public Cloud consist of images, we then visit the monitoring and security of these images, digital watermarking, and data provenance. Lastly, a description of Follow-Me Cloud to minimize latency and security wraps up this chapter.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Computer Communication Networks']"

The most disappointing thing is that we can hardly recycle only 10% of electronic garbage globally. Now, what about 90% of the waste? Unfortunately, 90% of the waste we do not recycle, or we can not, and that 90% causes huge damage to the whole world. Recycling is needed because Toxic chemicals such as lead, and chromium can be found in many outdated electrical gadgets. Also, some examples are mercury, cadmium, and beryllium. These chemicals seep into the soil when e-waste is thrown into landfills, damaging both the groundwater and the air. A lot of recycling business models exist but we have tried to develop a sustainable recycling process business model by analysis. We have gone to two companies and tried to know their business process model also we have collected some data. We have tried to implement our business process model.

Closely spaced bending modes are typical for symmetrical structures, such as towers. When monitoring such structures, identifying the mode shapes in particular is a challenge. In addition to environmental effects, the identification uncertainty is elevated for closely spaced modes, which leads to higher scatter in the identified mode shapes. In order to be able to investigate and quantify the influences, data from a structure with repairable damage is used. In particular, the investigation is carried out on long-term measurement data of the Leibniz University Test Structure for Monitoring (LUMO). LUMO enables the examination of different damage positions under ambient excitation and environmental conditions. For the identification, Bayesian Operational Modal Analysis (BAYOMA) is used. By considering the uncertainty of the modal parameters, especially for the mode shapes, a better understanding of the influence of damage and environmental conditions on the structure can be obtained. This is helpful for further monitoring stages, such as damage localisation using modal updating.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Prematurity is the leading cause of newborn deaths and the second leading cause of death worldwide. Professional nursing practice is characterized by a moral commitment to patient advocacy. In this respect, training plays an indispensable role in ensuring optimal quality of patient care by developing competencies that enhance the ability to make appropriate decisions, fulfill various tasks an responsibilities, and personalize the care process. Simulation-Based Training - SimNewB, Advanced training in neonatal resuscitation. The nurse must know how to deal with different situations with skill, ability, scientificity and proximity to the patient's needs. Training in simulation is a methodology that has the primary objective of improving the quality and effectiveness of clinical care. SimNewB is useful to learn how to perform the correct techniques, improve simulation training, encourage teamwork. Through a realistic reproduction of the anatomy of its airways, accurate clinical feedback and wireless design, SimNewB contributes to the achievement of the skills necessary to manage compromised infants. Conclusion . Following the evolution of Sars-Cov2 (COVID-19) there has been repercussions in the organization of trainings; to contain the transmission of the virus it was allowed to carry out training face to face activities maintaining a 1/1 ratio (tutor-learner). All face-to-face training with a ratio greater than 1 to 1 has been cancelled. According to the norms, the 1/1 ratio was maintained during training in simulation. Theoretical part, briefing and debriefing took place remotely in call conference. The teaching method was supported through video training.

The aim is to identify children and adolescents who meet full CD criteria and persistently and pervasively show two or more out of four criteria: (1) lack of remorse or guilt, (2) callous lack of empathy, (3) unconcerned about performance, and (4) shallow or deficient affect. The inclusion of the LPE specifier was based on a robust literature that enucleated a specific subgroup of CD children and adolescents characterized by severe maladaptive and antisocial behaviors and high developmental risk for adult antisocial personality disorder and global negative outcome. This subgroup of CD youths has been associated with the presence of specific temperamental traits, described primarily in adult psychopathy, named callous-unemotional (CU) traits, and characterized by reduced emotional responsiveness to others’ distress, low sensitivity to punishment cues, impairment in empathic concerns, and scarce capacity to generate prosocial attitudes. This chapter will describe the symptomatologic correlates and developmental trajectories of CU traits from childhood through adolescence to adulthood and will try to elucidate the international literature of the past 15 years’ contributions with respect to the identification of genetic, temperamental, and socio-environmental factors in the genesis of CU traits as well as with respect to their neurobiological and psychophysiological underpinnings. With the aim to facilitate the early identification of children and adolescents with CD and CU traits with preventive purposes, assessment strategies will be proposed, and validated assessment tools will be described in clinical and nonclinical populations, for different age groups and from various informants (self-reports, parents, teachers, clinicians). Finally, major therapeutic intervention models will be described that have shown evidence of effectiveness in CD with CU traits by reducing aggressive and antisocial behaviors and preventing negative outcomes.","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Emotion', 'Personality and Social Psychology']"

Despite clear advantages of a smooth transition into the labour force, many newcomers experience multiple barriers impeding their pathways to sustainable livelihoods. Further, significant increases in refugee resettlement and asylum claims in Canada since 2015 resulted in a growing number of refugee newcomers entering the labour market, often facing additional challenges of precarious legal status while seeking employment. To interrogate the settlement landscape, this chapter examines newcomers’ employment-related needs, experiences, and aspirations through a case study of migrants and refugees in Greater Toronto. Using narrative-biographic interviews, the chapter presents an ethnographic approach to examine how individual migrants navigate labour market policies and settlement dynamics during their initial years. A biographical approach allowed us to focus on the interplay of migrant agency, precarity, and adaption to both long-standing labour market dynamics as well as new barriers and enablers brought on by the shifting sands of Canada’s pandemic affected economy. The chapter highlights how emotions, decisions, and actions are inter-related and coalesce with broader structural conditions within a network of actors – individuals, networks, and institutions – to shape the labour market experiences of recently arrived immigrants and refugees.","['Social Sciences', 'Migration', 'Labor Economics', 'Sociology of Work']"

In recent years, deep learning-based methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proved to be remarkable tools in finding the underlying patterns in raw data and establishing accurate mapping between the data and various damage indicators. This study examines the performance of CNNs when the time-frequency information obtained from Continuous Wavelet Transformation (CWT) is employed as input data for prediction of the presence and location of damage in a beam-like structure. The CWT data from the acceleration reflect the variations in the modal properties of the structure and the characteristics of external excitations and measurement noise over time. This can help the network to distinguish different damage cases. For verification of the proposed approach, the acceleration data obtained from finite element dynamic analyses of a simply supported beam under random excitation are utilized where damage is induced in the form of loss in the flexural stiffness of elements. The input to the CNN architecture is a 3D block of CWT data of multiple accelerometers and the network is trained to output the presence and location of damage across the beam. By considering different levels of damage and number of measurement points, it is demonstrated that high detection accuracy can be achieved. Also, robustness of the technique against noisy data is investigated where the acceleration data are intentionally corrupted by added random noise to simulate actual conditions.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

Nevertheless, this new wave in diplomacy has limitations that have to be analysed to better understand network diplomacy. Furthermore, there are also prospects for network diplomacy in the twenty-first century as it is set to play a key role in acting as the foundation for most new forms of diplomacy. The research considers the five most relevant challenges to the modern network diplomacy and seeks to make predictions on its further development. The purpose of this chapter is to reveal and analyse problems of network diplomacy as well as to make an educated guess about the prospects of its further development as a tool of international relations for various actors in the twenty-first century. During the research the author discovered several general problems, undermining the effectiveness of the “network” of modern diplomacy. The problems found are shifts in states’ sovereignty due activeness of other actors; excessive bureaucratization caused by the complexity of the modern system of international relations; lack of trust conditioned by misperceptions and clashing values of opposite parties; threats to cybersecurity of states; and non-state actors posed by developing e-technologies. Every participant in the network has its limitations due to the recent transformations in the system of international relations. Thus, states are losing their absolute sovereignty in conducting foreign policy because of the emergence of new actors. Several events were analysed after this step, to further illustrate the discovered problems of network diplomacy. They will be looked at in the parts of the research dedicated to the progress in the development of information technology and lack of influence of some actors of network diplomacy (Problem №4 and Problem №5).","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Diplomacy', 'International Relations', 'International Organization']"

For antimicrobial activity, nature has invented a great variety of antibiotic modes of action that involve the perturbation of essential bacterial structures or biosynthesis pathways of macromolecules such as the bacterial cell wall, DNA, RNA, or proteins, thereby threatening the specific microbial lifestyle and eventually even survival. However, along with highly inventive modes of antibiotic action, nature also developed a comparable set of resistance mechanisms that help the bacteria to circumvent antibiotic action. Microorganisms have evolved specific adaptive responses that allow to appropriately react to the presence of antimicrobial agents, thereby ensuring survival during antimicrobial stress. In times of rapid development and spread of antibiotic (multi-)resistance, new resistance-breaking strategies to counteract bacterial infections are desperately needed. This chapter is an update to Chapter 1 of the first edition of this book and intends to give an overview of common antibiotics and their target pathways. It will also present examples for new antibiotics with novel modes of action, illustrating that nature’s repertoire of innovative new antimicrobial agents has not been fully exploited yet, and we still might find new drugs that help to evade established antimicrobial resistance strategies.","['Life Sciences', 'Biological Techniques', 'Medical Microbiology']"

In particular, space layout in school buildings should keep a safe distance among people to protect occupants’ health while satisfying requirements for space utilization purposes to ensure learning experience. However, space constraints and conditions such as room size, boundary, and door locations, etc. make it difficult to adapt space layout required for diverse learning experiences. In this respect, this research aims to apply a space planning framework using Building Information Modeling (BIM) that can streamline the process of reconfiguring space layout. The research outcomes contribute to decision-making of space layouts for providing suitable indoor environments under emergency situations beyond the current pandemic. Although the space planning method has helped with optimizing different space types within a building, it has not expanded its usability within a single space due to lack of understanding inter-relationships of multiple constituent elements within a space. In this respect, this research addresses the constraints of elements within a space to respond to an emerging issue of flexible space reconfiguration for protecting occupants’ health and learning experience. This research broadens applications of the space planning method to responsive and resilient space management by integrating it with BIM in the architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

When the brain’s blood and other nutrients flow are interrupted, symptoms may manifest. According to the estimations of the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the leading global cause of death and disability. Though, several machine learning methods have been developed for effective identification and prediction of the risk involved in early stage stroke, the problem is sill at infancy. In this paper, an ensemble-based method to learn the CatBoostClassifier has been proposed as an effective tool for early stroke prediction. Stroke prediction dataset is used to test the method. The prediction accuracy of the proposed model is found to be greater than that of earlier research, demonstrating the efficacy of the model.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

These behaviors severely affect students’ growth and development. In many cases, student problem behaviors are caused by the unsatisfied psychological needs, which are defined as the need deficiency. Hence, diagnosing students’ need deficiencies and regulating their problem behaviors are important educational tasks. The previous psychological studies have analyzed how distinct factors might affect student’s problem behaviors. However, the school teachers without such expertise may still encounter difficulties in applying these findings. Hence, this chapter describes the process of designing and implementing an intelligent teacher assistant, which could advise teachers and help them to handle the student problem behavior. Technically, it utilizes a task-oriented dialogue system to help identify the underlying reasons (i.e., the student need deficiency) behind their problem behaviors, and accordingly relies on a community question answering system to provide the advice. It also employs the semantic search technology to find the similar cases that have been well resolved by the experienced teachers.","['Psychology', 'Psychology, general', 'Computer Applications', 'Education, general', 'Philosophy of Mind', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

However, lack of encryption and authentication during device discovery, link setup, and data transmission exposes the transmitted data to numerous security and privacy threats. To counter these security threats, a number of schemes have been developed based on public key infrastructure, bilinear pairing operations, batch verification, pre-computed lookup tables, symmetric cryptography, and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) among others. However, these techniques experience very high communication and computation overheads or fail to address privacy and security challenges effectively. In this paper, a session key agreement protocol is proposed to address some of these issues. Simulation results showed that the proposed protocol exhibits the lowest communication costs and average computation costs.

The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) and associated frameworks have ushered in a new era of smart, automated applications that require minimum human intervention to provide effective solutions. However, it is quintessential that some critical, real-time, human health related problems be addressed in a human-centric approach with the aid of the current technological developments. The assessment and early detection of maternal risk is a persisting issue which often results in loss of life and/or trauma in pregnant women. The proposed work addresses this problem with the development of a smart system that is capable of identifying the intensity of maternal risk based on physiological health parameters of the patients. It is observed that the Decision Tree classification algorithm is more effective in developing such a critically important system, than other algorithms like Logistic Regression and Multi-Layer Perceptron. Our system thus provides an efficient solution that can mitigate mis-identification of maternal risk intensity to a large extent whilst ensuring an accuracy of 83.5%.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery']"

However, the discrepancy in measured natural frequencies may result from environmental changes, the soil-structure interaction or effects caused by earthquakes. This makes it difficult to decide whether the local change in structural properties is caused by damage or other factors. To address this challenge and thus improve the current damage detection method, the wave propagation analysis method and the transmissibility relationship were considered. In our study, the wave propagation field in structures was reconstructed by applying the Normalized-Input-Output-Minimization (NIOM) method to vibration recordings. Wave velocities and transmissibility functions were considered as reference values for the damage indicators. This paper demonstrates the evaluation of local property changes in two examples of large-scale structures: a 14-story RC building and a 64 m long pedestrian bridge. The proposed damage indicators show a clear correspondence to structural changes.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Structural Materials', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

Welds are, amongst critical railway components, an essential element where high response amplitudes can occur. The monitoring of welds is still largely based on human assessment via typically visual means. We propose an automated approach to weld condition diagnostics via use of Extreme Value Analysis; an outlier detection schema which allows the early detection of flaws. In a second assessment phase, these potentially damaged welds are then assessed by experts during in-office and on-site inspections. The evolution of these OBM-based weld condition indicators is then tracked over time, leading to early detection of damaged welds.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

We describe a method for inferring people’s daily activity patterns, including the places they visit and when they do so, as well as the duration of the visit, based on GPS position traces of their mobile phones and Yellow Pages information. An analysis of 31,855 mobile phone users reveals that people are more likely to stay at restaurants or food outlets for longer periods of time, and to a lesser extent at retail or shopping sites, when the weather is extremely cold or the ambiance is calm (non-windy). People’s activity habits are affected by certain weather conditions when compared to their usual patterns. People’s motions and activities are evident at different times of the day. The weather has a wide range of effects on different geographical areas of a large city.

The figure is alarming, indicating that aggression is widespread in local schools. Furthermore, without early intervention to prevent the aggressive behavior of schoolchildren, the aggressors might commit further criminal acts when they grow up, thereby negatively affecting their schools, families, and society in the long run. This chapter reviews the characteristics of people with reactive and proactive aggression, the interventions used to reduce aggression in students in Hong Kong, and the effectiveness of these interventions.","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Emotion', 'Personality and Social Psychology']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-13814-0_5,en,“Bastions of Hope”: The Democratic Potential of a Willing Judiciary in Progressive Socio-Economic Rights Litigation in South Africa and Nigeria,OriginalPaper,"The realisation of socio-economic rights has remained a challenge in many African countries. While there is often legal recognition of their existence, necessary material commitment to their fulfilment can often be lacking. In these instances, litigation for the enforcement of socio-economic rights provides an opportunity for State accountability and subsequent necessary action. Unfortunately, the judicial arm of government in these countries are not always responsive to their roles in the fulfilment of socio-economic rights and may be unduly hesitant to hold State parties accountable. This chapter examines the role of the judiciary in the realisation of socio-economic rights in South Africa and Nigeria, through a comparative analysis of the approach of the courts. We argue that the judiciary must be inclined to make progressive rulings if the aims of socio-economic rights are to be met. We suggest therefore that, while existing legislative frameworks are important for framing the judicial responses to socio-economic cases brought before them, judicial interpretation of those laws depends on the willingness of the judiciary to be progressive. To this end, the determination of the possibilities for realising socio-economic right cannot be constrained simply to law in the books but must include an analysis of how those laws are interpreted in context. We argue that the willingness of the judiciary to be progressive in their adjudication of socio-economic rights will be largely dependent on their own conception of their role in the democratic and political process of their country, and how that role is to be fulfilled vis a vis the other arms of government and their own roles.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'African Politics']"

Besides the police officers, the urban authorities had other resources that helped them as well as the commissioners to ensure that good order could be maintained in the city. These were the tribunaux de simple police (police courts) and the regulatory power given to the mayors to promulgate municipal decrees. Together with these security mechanisms, the Napoleonic police, like their counterparts under the Ancien Régime , aimed to improve the functionality and the safety of the city. They took responsibility for problems that existed in cities and only because the cities existed, such as markets, theatres, factories, social venues and so on. Furthermore, these typically urban places called for specific kinds of surveillance, or even for the stationing of particular agents of the police in such places because they attracted the mobile and marginal populations that were increasingly seen as a risk to social cohesion. The same was true of the port cities, whether maritime or river ports, and for suburbs and theatres. The police were indeed the ultimate relay connecting local authorities to the police of the Regime, but the duties that they sought to perform and that had a political dimension were often secondary to their daily duties.","['History', 'History of France', 'History of Modern Europe', 'Imperialism and Colonialism', 'Urban History', 'Crime and Society']"

Therefore, timely diagnosis is key to optimal behavioural and psycho-social interventions for patients with AD. Recent advancements in technologies in general and multimodal machine learning specifically have provided an option for high-tech diagnosis that not only provides shortened wait time, but also utilises different data streams in the patient’s profile to enrich the final decision. The task of information integration, however, is challenging due to the heterogeneity of different modalities. For this purpose, this paper proposes an end-to-end multimodal analysis pipeline for Alzheimer’s dementia detection. Our framework is evaluated on a combined dataset from DementiaBank’s Pitt and Wisconsin Longitudinal Study datasets.

During the maintenance interventions preceding EXPO 2015, almost all the tie-rods of the cathedral underwent visual inspection, geometric characterization and hammer tests to evaluate their dynamic characteristics. After a brief summary of the experimental procedures, the paper focuses on presenting and exemplifying the structural identification approach adopted in the vibration-based assessment of the tensile force in the metallic ties. The presented procedure differs from the one proposed by Tullini and Laudiero (2008) since: (a) the Young’s modulus of the metallic material is assumed to be unknown and (b) the resonant frequencies of higher modes are used to solve the inverse problem. The application of the proposed procedure is mainly exemplified with reference to the tension bars exhibiting the higher stress level (larger than 100 MPa) as those elements are now permanently instrumented with vibrating wire extensometers. Selected results from the long-term monitoring of the tie-rods are briefly discussed as well.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

As such, society will be heavily dependent on the ability to protect these new wireless networks as well as the radio spectrum. Solutions such as artificial intelligence (AI)-based transmitter fingerprinting to identify and track unintended interference sources or malicious actors will be one of the several key technologies required to meet the needs of the next generation wireless networks as this technology is deployed as part of a critical infrastructure (CI). As an example, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can be considered under these cyber-physical systems and critical infrastructures. As 95 percent of new automobiles are expected to be equipped with vehicle to infrastructure (V2I), vehicle to vehicle (V2V), and other telecommunications capabilities by 2022. To ensure the safety of the public, new and automated techniques are needed to protect CAVs on the road from unintentional or malicious interference. Against these requirements, this chapter presents the state of the art in real time decision support systems for the cyber-physical systems that build on critical infrastructures such as CAVs, through radio fingerprinting solutions.

The project was developed from a collaboration between Alzheimer Portugal, and the Lusófona University, Porto, through the Communication Design BA. Based on the case study of the Memória de Mim Day Care Centre (a service from Alzheimer Portugal), it aimed to create signage and cognitive stimulation materials inspired by Portuguese culture and biographical components of the Centre’s users. Research has shown the need for design intervention in the creation of artefacts aimed at People with Dementia, given the scarcity of materials in this area in Portugal. This project is a starting point to fill this gap in the Portuguese market, while aiming to introduce contents in the field of Social Design to design students, an area less addressed in current courses. The materials developed benefited the Centre’s community, contributing to cognitive stimulation activities and moments of sociability among users with dementia. The project also benefited the students by providing a real work context and highlighting the importance of their role in society as designers. A larger project is now under study, integrating various Alzheimer Portugal services and university contexts, aiming to research and create further cognitive stimulation artefacts targeted at People with Dementia in Portugal. We believe that a more focused study on biographical components and vernacular culture of these people will contribute significantly to improve their health and well-being.","['Architecture / Design', 'Industrial Design', 'Geriatric Care', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering']"

Combining data and ML consequently enables continuous improvement that differs from conventional continuous improvement, especially in higher efficiency on default detection. However, scientific literature needs to be updated continuously. Hence, this work aims to gather research information on advancements in ML applications in organisations for continuous improvement purposes. Following the PRISMA Statement, 11 relevant articles were analysed. Results evidenced that most research is case-specific and focuses on applicability. Furthermore, it was observed that most papers are from the manufacturing industry. Although some theoretical research indicates the potential of ML applications in the operations domain (i.e., before and post-production processes), the literature in this segment is lacking. It can be concluded that the potential of ML in management systems is dependent on the amount and quality of data. However, this latter comes at a high cost and therefore, careful cost–benefit analysis should be made before adopting ML in businesses. Overall, this review provided promising perspectives for applying ML within quality systems and potential leading ways for continuous improvement in safety, environment and integrated management systems.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Occupational Medicine/Industrial Medicine', 'Industrial and Organizational Psychology']"

Patients and Methods Medical records and follow-up data from 190 patients were gathered retrospectively. All patients had surgery at pOC and at least one further rOC surgery at four European high-volume centers. Patients were divided into one cohort with confirmed mutation for BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 ( BRCA mut) and a second cohort with BRCA wild type or unknown ( BRCA wt). Patterns of tumor presentation, surgical outcome and survival data were analyzed between the two groups. Results Patients with BRCA mut disease were on average 4 years younger and had significantly more tumor involvement upon diagnosis. Patients with BRCA mut disease showed higher debulking rates at all stages. Multivariate analysis showed that only patient age had significant predictive value for complete tumor resection in pOC. At rOC, however, only BRCA mut status significantly correlated with optimal debulking. Patients with BRCA mut disease showed significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) by 24.3 months. Progression-free survival (PFS) was prolonged in the BRCA mut group at all stages as well, reaching statistical significance during recurrence. Conclusions Patients with BRCA mut disease showed a more aggressive course of disease with earlier onset and more extensive tumor dissemination at pOC. However, surgical outcome and OS were significantly better in patients with BRCA mut disease compared with patients with BRCA wt disease. We therefore propose to consider BRCA mut status in regard to patient selection for cytoreductive surgery, especially in rOC.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery']"

In this work, we study notification delays in Android mobile/wearable devices and examine trends in notification delays across devices. We analyze thirty-two devices based on notification pushes, and we observe that there are delays between the smartphone generating notification pushes and the connected wearable device receiving said notification. The delay is especially observed from notification push performance on older devices. We then identify several vectors of hardware and network aspects that cause delays.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

There has been very limited work on the reliability of MUT of corrosion as most of the research focused on MUT of weldments. The current body of literature showed a host of human factors that affected MUT, and a survey carried out on Non-destructive testing (NDT) personnel working in industry highlighted that two areas of concern were the task and the inspector. It is proposed that the use of a magnetic probe coupler (MPC) will aid the task and the inspector in carrying out a reliable MUT inspection. It will do this by ensuring that probe coupling is maintained to the Carbon Steel surface when working in a variety of positions while improving the tactility of scanning a component. It will greatly aid the monitoring of known areas of wall loss by ensuring that the probe is coupled consistently and accurately in the same position. The areas of wall loss can be easily marked when the technician is not manually trying to hold the probe to the test piece.

Citizen science has been shown to be a very good tool for providing useful data for scientists, if well directed. For example, the monitoring of invasive species is impossible to do from research institutes due to lack of money, tools and personnel. But well trained, even sporadic tourists can give useful information about their distribution. This is also true in the case of rare or endangered species, or in migrations or the detection of anomalies. They can also be useful in tracking marine litter, not only helping to clean beaches and seabed, but also observing the origin of that waste thanks to photos or collections that can be used to understand where the objects come from. Other observations and data collection are more complex, and require specialists to make adequate quantitative observations, but may still benefit from broad support from people who want to help in the logistical part. Once again, indigenous people are put in the spotlight, because they help to solve many problems thanks to their great local wisdom. We are realizing that many of the things we do to monitor and give keys for conservation are provided by local populations who have lived in, protected or managed the areas we want to study for hundreds of years or millennia. That is why it is important to accelerate the follow-up processes by broadening the spectrum of people who can help in these processes, professionals and non-professionals alike. However, there are limits. Specialist teams are still needed to do sampling, monitoring or experiments. The tools used by scientific research teams to make such monitoring programs have substantially advanced. The technology to keep track of the problems we have in the oceans has made a really important qualitative leap. For example, although attempts have been made to track oil spills in certain circumstances, only the collection of data by specialists can help to understand the origin of contaminants. Coastal and ocean governance needs a paradigm change. We need co-governance processes in which democratic decisions, education and awareness-raising fit together. The models in which people interact with science, problems and solutions about the oceans are more and more demanded, and the last two decades have been crucial. An authentic bottom-up process in which all these advances and the different ways of observing nature and the impacts suffered are available to non-specialists.

The slab is embedded with different types of artificially constructed defects, such as shallow delamination, void, honeycomb, and deep delamination. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) has been applied to filter the noise from the data collected.

A relatively contagious disease unfolded through the SARS-CoV-2 virus that travelled throughout the globe and was declared an epidemic by WHO in March 2020. The need of examining the scenario became the inducement behind this research. The assessment of COVID-19 in India is performed from 1 April 2020 to 20 May 2021 which amassed a total of 415 instances. Further, preprocessing of the dataset is executed with the use of normalization. The experimentation is executed through the use of four ensemble strategies which are bagging, boosting, stacking and voting with four distinct machine learning algorithms linear regression, sequential minimal optimizer for regression, multilayer perceptron and Gaussian process. The splitting of the dataset is completed at 75%, and machine learning algorithms with ensemble techniques are applied. Linear regression with the bagging ensemble method gives satisfactory outcomes with the correlation coefficient of 0.935 and 0.919 for confirmed cases and recovered cases, respectively, and Gaussian process presented the best results for deceased cases. In the case of ensemble strategies, bagging indicates the best correlation coefficient in each case. Therefore, with the help of the three best algorithms, confirmed cases, recovered cases and deceased cases predictions are performed.

The benzene, being a non-magnetic molecule by nature, has health-threatening effects on human body. The adsorption of benzene is focused on two configurations, namely pristine and doped MoSe 2 monolayer. The higher adsorption energy is witnessed for Fe-doped MoSe 2 monolayer. Likewise, the charge transfer also excels for Fe-doped MoSe 2 monolayer in benzene adsorption rather than the other configurations. However, the individual charge transfer between surrounding atoms is higher for Mn atom. To show the capability of MoSe 2 monolayer to detach the adsorbed benzene molecule, the recovery time is estimated. It is observed that with higher adsorption energy, the recovery time is increased. It is difficult to remove the adsorbed molecule from the surface at lower temperature, so to facilitate easy removal, the temperature is increased to high value of 498 K. Thus, it is concluded that MoSe 2 monolayer is suitable for designing of green sensors with lower recovery time and high adsorption energy.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation', 'Nanotechnology and Microengineering']"

Many of these studies are focused on topics related to the structural health monitoring (SHM) of this material, as its susceptibility to internal cracks and fissures are unnoticeable to visual inspection. Thus, this work presents the study of two reproducible methods of acoustic emission for two different structural conditions of a CFRP sheet in order to verify the effectiveness of each method in identifying damage, using an electret microphone for monitoring. One of the used methods is the Pencil Lead Break (PLB), which is well known in the literature, and the other is the proposed method, which consists of launching a screwdriver bit on the structure surface. To this purpose, tests were conducted for both methods on the sheet surface before and after the addition of a small metallic body to simulate structural damage. The acoustic waves generated from the tests were captured by the electret microphone attached close to the edge of the CFRP sheet. The results showed that both methods were able to identify the damage on the structure, and the proposed method is viable as a higher acoustic power alternative for monitoring the structural integrity of this type of material.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Machine Learning', 'Robotics and Automation']"

When energy dissipation structure is tested by RTHT, the damper is usually adopted as physical substructure and the structure is adopted as numerical substructure. In order to minimize the seismic response of energy dissipation structure, many dampers installed at different positions are often necessary. The dynamic response of dampers at different positions is different in seismic action. Therefore, more than one damper needs to be tested physically in RTHT, and multiple dampers loaded by multiple actuators in real time will increase control difficulty. To solve this issue, an offline hybrid testing method for energy dissipation structure is proposed based on machine learning, which avoids the challenge of control and stability caused by real-time loading of multiple actuators in RTHT. The feasibility of this method is proved by numerical simulation, which provides a new idea for seismic testing of energy dissipation structure.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Public Policy', 'Arts']"

However, vehicle-based indirect SHM still entails several challenges that require further research. In this paper, the application of the vehicle-based indirect SHM method is demonstrated numerically and experimentally for determining the natural frequencies of an Austrian railway bridge. At first, the coupled equations of motion of the train-bridge multi-body model are presented and train crossing simulations are conducted numerically considering different train speeds. The vibration responses during train crossing are evaluated for both the train multi-body system and the considered railway bridge model. Different representative evaluation points are chosen at the wheelsets, bogies, and car bodies of the considered train. At second, the resonance frequencies of the bridge are measured in-situ by executing forced vibration tests applying closed-loop controlled electrodynamic shakers. Besides in-situ measurements of the bridge, the considered moving train is also equipped with accelerometers, and the vibration responses of both the bridge and the moving train are measured simultaneously during the duration of several train crossings. The recorded vibration responses are analyzed in the frequency domain and compared with the numerical simulation results. It is shown that the first longitudinal bending frequency of the considered railway bridge can be clearly identified from the computed frequency response spectra.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

In the present work, the authors analyse the role of the ballast in the dynamic train-track-bridge interaction (TTBI). The analytical response of Euler-Bernoulli (EB) beams is coupled with a distributed springs layer modelling the ballast. The two equations are solved with trainloads as elementary moving load excitation, avoiding too complex models. This non-classically damped problem has been solved with a Runge-Kutta finite-difference method with temporal-spatial discretization. Furthermore, the authors experimentally validated the mathematical TTBI solution, comparing it with the displacement response of a case study. Specifically, at first, experimental modal bending stiffness parameters have been estimated to provide a representative equivalent EB beam model. Thereafter, the coupling effects of the ballast have been considered with a sensitivity analysis of the modelling parameters. Finally, the optimization to the actual experimental response of the model provided an estimate of the vertical ballast stiffness and its damping. The relevant difference in the damping of the experimental and mathematical model evidences the fundamental role of the ballast in adsorbing vibrations induced by the train passages.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

These techniques are known as intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) and the most common include somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEPs), transcranial motor-evoked potentials (TcMEPs), free running electromyography (EMG), and D wave monitoring. Along with these, mapping techniques to localize specific functions in the spinal cord can be employed, such as dorsal columns and cortico-spinal tract mapping.

This paper analyzes the spread of fake news about Covid in the Ecuadorian technological scene, in order to promote an understanding and subsequent debate that contributes to the generation of prevention strategies and even reduction of its impact on the Internet and social networks, for the benefit of communication and democracy. One of the serious problems caused by disinformation is the appearance of rumors, which in the context of a health emergency cause anguish and despair among the population. This is where a social environment is needed in which the State shields the production of fake news and the destruction of disinformation from official communication, through transparent and precise communication, with clear and detailed messages on the form of prevention and attention, that it arrives by truthful technological means. Much better if these are disseminated through official spokespersons from different professional branches: scientific community, authorities with responsibilities in health matters and civil society organizations with an aligned and coherent discursive line, to share certainties with the public and appease the anguish of the situation, and communication technology professionals. In the context of political information and technological strategic communication, it is worrying that social networks are the strategic field to attack the adversary by creating rumors that are spread as fake news. A similar case occurs with the false information that circulates on social networks in relation to the health emergency, and that puts people’s lives at risk. As evidenced, information technology is a weapon on an unprecedented scale. This is precisely because the technological and communicational advances of the information society have facilitated the fabrication and manipulation of content that, when disseminated through social networks, dramatically amplifies the lies produced by the States, by populist politicians and by dishonest corporations, among the population, that lacks criteria to assess these technological contents.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The transducers are used in emitter-receiver pairs. Concrete specimens were subjected to 70 freeze-thaw cycles of 12 h in temperature ranges from −20 ℃ to +17 ℃ and the monitoring system automatically and continuously recorded ultrasonic signals every 5 min. With such rich information, it is possible to monitor the difference between recorded signals during freezing and thawing phases, as well as transition times between these two phases. Several indicators were extracted from the recorded signals to evaluate the level of degradation of the concrete, including the traditional wave velocity and the first wave amplitude of the recorded signals as well as Coda wave parameters. The results show that the first wave amplitude is a more sensitive indicator of early freeze-thaw damage than the traditionally used wave velocity. Coda wave interferometry (CWI) also proves to be an interesting and complementary indicator to better understand the freeze-thaw damage mechanism in concrete.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The usage of aromatics, plasticizers and pesticides in day-to-day life in cosmetic products, ripe fruits and vegetables, etc. are one of the major concerns since of their commercial usage and predictable potential threats that have to posed human health and ecosystem. These compounds are toxic. Microorganisms also play vital role in dealing with problems related to environment like decomposition and many more good factors for which microorganisms are responsible. This is because the microorganisms decompose dead organic waste of plants and animals converting them into simple substances. Thus, microorganisms can be used to degrade the harmful and smelly substances and thereby clean up the environment. These organisms have survived in all places on the biosphere because of their metabolic activity due to their existence in all over range of environmental conditions. Bioremediation involves the use of microbes and is also considered to be the most efficient, cost-effective, and eco-friendly method to eliminate industrial pollutants from the environment. They are involved in degradation, eradication, immobilization, or detoxification of diverse chemical wastes and physical hazardous materials from the surrounding through the comprehensive action of microorganisms’ and their overall results.

While inclusive practices are always evolving, there has been a slow but definite progression in the shift towards an inclusive future. In today’s inclusive climate more and more children with special educational needs (SEN) are entering the mainstream classroom in which teachers are expected to cater to their needs (Bentley-Williams et al. 2017 ). However, this may prove problematic if teachers hold negative attitudes towards the inclusion of these students. Teachers’ attitudes towards inclusion may influence their willingness to accommodate students with special educational needs in regular classrooms (Bentley-Williams et al. 2017 ). Additionally, negative teacher attitudes towards inclusion generally sustain substandard academic achievements and behaviours for students with special educational needs (Bradley 2009 ). Therefore, as the topic of inclusion opens for debate, teacher attitudes become of particular interest.

The analysis and identification of cracks are important for monitoring, diagnosis, and maintenance of concrete structures, to avoid malfunctioning or unsafe conditions in the structures. The most tedious process is to identify the exact time and location of a crack in the concrete structures. In this paper, the solution has been given to identifying the time and location of the crack by Electrical Resistivity Method which is one of the non-contact process methods without having any direct physical contact with the structure. Arduino UNO mega 2560 and resistors are used to find the occurrence of a crack in the structures. In the structure, the conductive paint coating has been given and it is separated into several blocks. Each block is connected with various values of resistors. The constant voltage has been given in the blocks and resistance values are noted. When the cracks occur, at that time conductive paint resistivity value will change. The change of resistivity value has been deducted by Arduino UNO mega 2560 microprocessor with coding. It gives the signal immediately after when the crack occurs in the structure. To manually interrupt the connection which is made by the conductive paint, switches have been fixed to validate the results. From this experiment, it is observed that the minute cracks are also deducted and exact results are given by Arduino.","['Engineering', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Materials Science, general', 'Nanotechnology']"

This chapter shows the application of measurement in a social science context where the motivation is transparency and equity rather than the advancement of scientific laws. However, to achieve these, the realization of measurement needs to be no less rigorous than it is in the advancement of scientific laws. Rasch measurement theory provides the basis for such rigor. The context in this chapter is competitive selection into universities in Western Australia based on a summary performance on a series of instruments which assess achievement in a range of discipline areas. Such selection tends to determine life opportunities; therefore to ensure consistency and fairness, performances on different instruments need to be transformed into measurements which are in the same, explicit unit relative to a specified origin. Because the illustrative context is complex, it is considered that the Rasch measurement theory applied in this chapter could be applied to a range of social contexts where assessments on different instruments need to be transformed to measurements in a common unit referenced to a common origin and where the focus is on making decisions at the person level.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Health Informatics', 'Psychometrics', 'Health Administration']"

Unfortunately, a common challenge for these systems is the low-quality and high level of noise in ECG signal collection. Also, generic techniques to assess the ECG quality can discard useful information in these so-called chagasic ECG signals. To mitigate this issue, this work proposes a 1D CNN network to assess the quality of the ECG signal for chagasic patients and compare it to the state of art techniques.

Different feature extractions were considered such as morphological fiducial points, interval duration, and statistical features, aiming to classify 400 segments into four signal quality types: Acceptable ECG, Non-ECG, Wandering Baseline (WB), and AC Interference (ACI) segments. The proposed CNN architecture achieves a $$0.90 \pm 0.02$$ accuracy in the multi-classification experiment and also $$0.94 \pm 0.01$$ when considering only acceptable ECG against the other three classes. Also, we presented a complementary experiment showing that, after removing noisy segments, we improved morphological recognition (based on QRS wave) by 33% of the entire ECG data. The proposed noise detector may be applied as a useful tool for pre-processing chagasic ECG signals.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Information Systems and Communication Service', 'Management of Computing and Information Systems']"

This methodological framework explores the links between data envelopment analysis (DEA) and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and proposes a new perspective on the use of the additive DEA model using concepts from the multi-attribute value theory (MAVT). One of the major strengths of VBDEA over typical DEA methodologies is that it offers information on the main reasons behind DMUs’ (in)efficiency. Additionally, this approach allows straightforwardly ranking of efficient and inefficient DMUs, since it relies on a super-efficiency model. Because of the use of value functions, besides allowing the incorporation of the decision-maker (DM)’s preferences, this methodology easily handles negative or null data. In this context, we illustrate the Python implementation of the method by reproducing the main results obtained by (Gouveia et al., Or Spectrum 38:743–767, 2016), when these authors evaluated the performance of 12 health units in a Portuguese region incorporating management preferences given by real DMs.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'European Politics', 'Economic Growth', 'Business and Management, general', 'Economic Policy', 'Environmental Policy']"

For most civil structures, field or full-scale tests to failure are not feasible, therefore scale model laboratory experiments are critical to advancing the state-of-the-art for structural design. To isolate the target structural behavior for evaluation, all structural behaviors, including impact of boundary conditions and members interactions, must be controlled and accurately accounted for in the associated structural models. Data collection including installation procedure, sensors type, sampling rate and data acquisition system are critical components to any experimental or field fatigue test. Fatigue experiments often benefit from data collected at locations that are difficult, if not impossible, to instrument with traditional contact strain gauges, such as weld toes or curved members. This paper presents the experimental fatigue evaluation of a unique steel connection, including the instrumentation plan, which utilizes contact and non-contact measurements, and collected data from a high cycle fatigue experiment of a scale model specimen of a gusset-less truss bridge connection. The monitoring protocol for an experimental fatigue test setup and the evaluation of structural response measurements is developed, implemented, and tested as part of this study. This paper also presents the use of numerical modeling to supplement experimental testing, and the high-cycle fatigue testing results of the novel connection studied herein.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

However, these deep models only effective when enough data for each observed failure category are available in the training durations. Otherwise, the performance of these models will notably decrease. As the critical component in large machinery, the gearbox often changes the speed and load along with the production demand in the practical application, which caused few data samples to be collected at certain conditions. This phenomenon introduces the few-shot fault diagnosis, and its goal is to identify the fault types with extremely limited data samples. To address this problem, a Meta-learning guided Few-shot Fault Diagnosis method, named MFFD, is proposed for gearbox fault diagnosis under limited data conditions. The results verify the effectiveness of our MFFD method at one-shot and five-shot fault diagnosis tasks under different speed and load conditions.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements']"

One of them was the media, where they had to combine face-to-face work with online work. Media such as television had to adopt formulas based on technology to develop their work, to present programs, and to contact their information sources virtually. One of the main resources used was the videoconference. The application of this technological tool for interviews or television debates turned the living room of journalists and news sources into a makeshift set. The objective of this paper is to analyze the role played by technology in the strategies developed by the different public and private television channels in Spain to overcome the situation and continue broadcasting. The methodology of the research is based on the analysis, through case study, of the television channels La 1 and La 2 of TVE (public) and Antena 3, La Sexta, Telecinco, and Cuatro (private). As the main results, we can highlight that many television programs have been broadcast from the presenters’ and collaborators’ own homes. Others were temporarily stopped being broadcasted because the conditions were not suitable for recording and it was not possible to work virtually. In other cases—as TV news—, on-set activities and videoconferences were combined, resulting in a mixed face-to-face and virtual format.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Health Informatics', 'Statistics, general']"

Deliberate institutional initiatives of increasing women’s participation in construction effect a social engineering process to tackle this issue, which is disruptive to the long-standing organisational routines in construction projects. This chapter presents a review of recent institutional initiatives of increasing women’s participation in the industry and examine their impact on the functionality of construction project organisations. The relevant institutional interventions and research were selected for an institutional analysis through a snowball sampling approach, starting from a recent Australian initiative to increase women’s participation in trades. Five institutional logics are identified that are driving and legitimating the gender equality agenda: the masculinity logic, the market logic, the feminism logic, the humanity logic and the femininity logic. The review starts from a focus on ‘women’ and ends with a focus on ‘femininity’. Key findings are: (1) Feminism in the current practice presumes a gender contradiction which mirrors the masculinity logic. (2) Professionalism, the logic of the work, is missing from the current gender equality discourses. (3) A distinction is drawn between the ideology of feminism and the general trait of femininity. (4) Complexity within feminism needs further study. The results suggest to foster the femininity logic through ungendered job roles and a caring, engaging and nurturing on-job practice, illustrated with three examples. The results suggest that the equality agenda move beyond gender politics to anchor itself in professionalism, embrace the femininity values more substantially in job design and appraisal that reward teamwork  to engender a cultural change in the industry.","['Engineering', 'Fire Science, Hazard Control, Building Safety', 'Building Construction and Design']"

Multi-dimensional injury-related data are captured in computerized systems at hospital emergency Emergencies rooms in various fields such as the presenting problem/triage text (or injury narrative Narratives ), injury diagnosis, location of the injury, external cause of injury and activity at the time of the accident. The external cause of injury code (E-code), which plays a significant role in injury surveillance, is typically assigned by human coders based on the case information collected at hospitals. Machine learning models trained on manually coded past data can predict E-codes based on the injury information captured in fields mentioned above and thus help human coders in the form of a semi-automated decision support system. Previous studies have examined the prediction performance of various machine learning models for predicting E-codes based on injury narratives Narratives , but they have not studied the performance of Bayesian Networks to predict E-codes based on the collective information available in different fields. In this study, we examined the prediction performance of multiple Bayesian Networks developed using various fields of injury-related data. Our results indicate that (a) the Bayesian Networks combining the information available from the narrative Narratives text with other fields results in better prediction performance as compared to prediction based on narrative Narratives alone, and (b) the prediction performance of Bayesian Network that used coder assigned values to the fields Mechanism of Injury (MEI) and Major Injury Factor (MIF) was better than the Bayesian Network that used narrative Narratives -based predicted values of MEI and MIF.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Utilizing these concepts urges new enhancements in the micro-sensor technology. As an example, micro-gyroscopes play an important role within the network of sensors in monitoring cracks or other impairments of structures, specially at points of rotation. A good example is the measurement of hinge rotations in large structures. Enhancing the performance of micro-gyroscopes is normally determined among others by the scale factor (sensitivity), Angle Random Walk and bias stability, which are dependent on the design as well as the control of a micro gyroscope. Our attention here is mainly given to micro-ring-gyroscopes, which offer some advantages with respect to the conventional comb-based micro gyroscopes, mainly due to the inherent geometrical symmetry. However, increasing the system’s sensitivity has been for long coupled to an increase of signal noises, thus, impairing the other performance measures. Applying high forced excitation on gyroscopes, leads to electric feed-through due to parasitic capacitances, thus increases noise. On the other hand, electronic amplification methods adds more electronic noise to the output readout signal. Avoiding such complications encouraged considering “mechanical” amplification techniques, which could enhance the mechanical system’s response before getting to the read-out electronics. To this end, many researchers have followed another alternative to the common forced excitation, which is the parametric excitation. Parametric excitation of micro gyroscopes started more than one decade ago, however, it was only useful at resonance frequencies, which causes complexity of the control system due to the required precise frequency tuning. In our contribution, however, we introduce a novel method of excitation in the field of micro-sensor technology, that is, a phase-shifted bimodal parametric excitation, which offers parametric amplification at “non-resonant” frequencies as well.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Most methods proposed for time series analysis and classification do not handle datasets with these characteristics nor do they offer interpretability and explainability, a critical requirement in the health domain. We propose an unsupervised method for learning representations of time series based on common patterns identified within them. The patterns are interpretable and extracted using Byte Pair Encoding compression technique. Since the patterns are variable in length, the method can capture both long-term and short-term dependencies present in the data.

A common source of pain arises from injury to the musculoskeletal system. Injury can occur with trauma, overuse, intense physical activity, or be a natural consequence of age-related degeneration. With increasing life expectancy, the prevalence of joint-related pain is expected to rise concomitantly. These population trends have fueled continued interest in developing techniques to promote healing of injured tissue, both as an alternative treatment and as a bridge to surgical treatment. Stem cells are specialized populations of cells found in the embryo as well as adults. They have the potential to differentiate into different cell lineages and serve both as a source of cells to replace normal cell turnover as well as a repair system to replace injured tissue. While they have been used in clinical medicine to treat hematologic and immune system disorders or restore bone marrow functionality after cancer treatment, they have more recently garnered strong interest in regenerative medicine. Techniques are being developed to isolate stem cells from different parts of the body and transplant them to sites of injury.

Heterogeneous sensor data were stored on a cloud database, which facilitated further analysis and visualization. Recording was undertaken in a computer laboratory with forty-five students. Statistical tests showed a positive correlation between carbon dioxide and air quality. However, there was no significant correlation between air quality and physical activity. Further recording was undertaken in a more controlled environment, a smaller room in which a high intensity training session was undertaken. This showed a positive correlation between physical activity and temperature and a negative correlation between humidity and physical activity. The Internet of things (IoT) can provide an ambient solution to assist with environmental monitoring and body worn activity trackers have achieved general user acceptance, but in real world applications technical issues persist with sensor calibration, reliability, device connectivity and data integration. Thus, the Internet of Everything, i.e., sensing, processing, and using environmental information provides significant recording and integration challenges.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

However, there is a paucity of objective benefit with this practice. Methods A retrospective review of our institutional registry involving repeat CRS-HIPEC cases was conducted, comparing cases that underwent a perfusion agent switch versus those cases with no switch. The primary outcome of this study was survival, measured by overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). A subgroup analysis was performed on the basis of primary etiology. Results A total of 101 cases met selection criteria. Mitomycin C was used as the index perfusion agent in 84% of cases, while oxaliplatin was utilized in the remaining 16% of cases. In total, 66 cases underwent a perfusion switch, with 35 cases using the same agent. Analysis revealed no survival benefit with HIPEC perfusion switch. For OS, there were similar mean survival times of 5.2 (± 4.1) years and 5.1 (± 3.6) years for cases with perfusion switch and no perfusion switch, respectively ( P = 0.985). The 5-year OS rates were also similar at 61.4% and 53.3% for switch and non-switch cases, respectively [odds ratio (OR) 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54–3.56, P = 0.49]. Mean DFS was 4.0 (± 4.2) years and 3.6 (± 3.8) years for switch and non-switch cases, respectively ( P = 0.74). The 5-year DFS rates had a greater difference with statistical trend, with rates of 53% versus 28% for switch and non-switch cases, respectively (OR 2.91, 95% CI 0.86–9.86, P = 0.081). Subgroup analysis had a similar trend to the main results. Conclusions The study findings revealed no survival benefit with switching perfusion agents. Analysis suggests that the practice of perfusion switch is ineffective.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery']"

Despite being one of the commonest procedures performed, the surgical fraternity all over the world is still in the quest for the final word on the best type of repair. Similarly, treatment of complex groin hernia remains the same [1]. Complex groin hernia can be defined as those with large size, e.g., inguinoscrotal hernia, sliding hernia, multiple recurrences, infected mesh and strangulation, etc. The approach to these hernias involves a great deal of preoperative preparations and decision-making that is carried through the operation and postoperative period. The laparoscopic approach in these cases is feasible and with good outcomes provided that the surgeon adheres to three M’s; mastery of the anatomy, meticulous dissection, and modus operandi [2]. No wonder hundreds of procedures have been described for the treatment of complex groin hernia. There has been always a concern about whether complex groin hernia can be treated with laparoscopy or not but more favorable outcomes have been found with laparoscopy than in open surgery [1].","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Minimally Invasive Surgery', 'Colorectal Surgery', 'Imaging / Radiology', 'Surgery']"

Transfascial herniations of the extremities can develop from congenital or acquired disruptions of the deep fascia, resulting in herniation of the underlying muscle, nerve, or soft tissue tumor into the subcutaneous tissues. While most patients present with a painless subcutaneous nodule that may change in size with muscle activation, some may experience focal or diffuse extremity symptoms such as pain and paresthesias. Although the diagnosis may be clinically suspected, radiologic evaluation is useful for definitive diagnosis and characterization. Ultrasound is the preferred modality for initial workup through a focused and dynamic examination. Magnetic resonance imaging can be utilized for equivocal, complicated, and preoperative cases. Computed tomography is less useful in the evaluation of transfascial herniations in the extremities due to similarities in the attenuation between muscle and fascia, which can decrease the conspicuity of small defects.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Imaging / Radiology', 'Orthopedics', 'Pathology', 'Nuclear Medicine']"

In the following sections, we will provide an insight on how the lipid and inflammatory profiles are related to the pathophysiology of T2DM and shed some light on how acute and chronic exercise can impact and ameliorate the metabolic dysfunction in T2DM individuals . In the first section, we will address the relationship of the lipid biomarkers with both obesity and T2DM by examining the classic pathophysiology of dyslipidemia, while going into further detail on the organ-crosstalk among the adipose tissue, muscle, and liver. At the muscle level, we will highlight the interrelationships between intramyocellular lipids and lipid intermediates and the development of muscle insulin resistance, whereas, at the liver, we will discuss how intrahepatic lipids are a strong lipid biomarker capable of predicting hepatic insulin resistance and other obesity-related complications. We will then connect how acute and chronic exercise can impact these aforementioned lipid biomarkers through a mechanistic approach, as well as provide a detailed review of the most recent results from randomized controlled trials (RCT) on the classic, clinically used lipid biomarkers (e.g., low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides).

When indicated, implantation of self-expandable solid bulking agents, such as Gatekeeper prostheses, is a feasible and minimally invasive technique. It consists of the placement, usually in the intersphincteric space, of a number of solid prostheses made of hyexpan (polyacrylonitrile), which characteristically expands up to 700% of its former volume by slow water absorption within 48 h from implantation. The postimplantation anatomical changes in the sphincter complex are thought to play a major role in functional improvement. Indeed, it has been fully demonstrated that increasing the in-vivo length of the external anal sphincter complex increases its contraction. Launched as the evolution of Gatekeeper, the Sphinkeeper device features more and longer hyexpan prostheses.

Recent studies suggested that defective mitophagy in beta cells caused diabetes. However, because of technical difficulties, the development of a convenient and reliable method to evaluate mitophagy in beta cells in vivo is needed. The aim of this study was to establish beta cell-specific mitophagy reporter mice and elucidate the role of mitophagy in beta cell function under metabolically stressed conditions induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). Methods Mitophagy was assessed using newly generated conditional mitochondrial matrix targeting mitophagy reporter (CMMR) mice, in which mitophagy can be visualised specifically in beta cells in vivo using a fluorescent probe sensitive to lysosomal pH and degradation. Metabolic stress was induced in mice by exposure to the HFD for 20 weeks. The accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria was examined by staining for functional/total mitochondria and reactive oxygen species (ROS) using specific fluorescent dyes and antibodies. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying mitophagy in beta cells, overexpression and knockdown experiments were performed. HFD-fed mice were examined to determine whether chronic insulin treatment for 6 weeks could ameliorate mitophagy, mitochondrial function and impaired insulin secretion. Results Exposure to the HFD increased the number of enlarged (HFD-G) islets with markedly elevated mitophagy. Mechanistically, HFD feeding induced severe hypoxia in HFD-G islets, which upregulated mitophagy through the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-ɑ (Hif-1ɑ)/BCL2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) axis in beta cells. However, HFD-G islets unexpectedly showed the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria due to excessive ROS production, suggesting an insufficient capacity of mitophagy for the degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria. Chronic administration of insulin ameliorated hypoxia and reduced ROS production and dysfunctional mitochondria, leading to decreased mitophagy and restored insulin secretion. Conclusions/interpretation We demonstrated that CMMR mice enabled the evaluation of mitophagy in beta cells. Our results suggested that metabolic stress induced by the HFD caused the aberrant accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, which overwhelmed the mitophagic capacity and was associated with defective maintenance of mitochondrial function and impaired insulin secretion.

It delineates the Palestinian economy’s dependence on external income over two distinct periods—the evolution of economic activity and public revenues under the Israeli military governments between 1967 and 1993, and the prevalence of external income and the fiscal composition of the Palestinian Authority since 1994. This historical approach is used to assess whether the Palestinian economy was inherently dependent on external income prior to the PA’s establishment. The chapter concludes that economic activity and public revenues in the West Bank and Gaza have historically been shaped by Israel’s political and economic policies and disproportionately relied on external income. It demonstrates that the fiscal character of the West Bank and Gaza has predominantly been defined by external income since 1967. It points to the increase in this reliance since the creation of the PA with its public revenues composed of 76 per cent of foreign aid and the Israeli-controlled clearance revenue. In addition, the Palestinian economy is found to be rent-driven, with a rent-to-GDP ratio of 37 per cent.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Middle Eastern Politics']"

It is difficult to achieve functional recovery for the damaged central nervous system (CNS) because of its limited ability to regenerate. Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are abundant in the CNS and are known to play essential roles in cell-cell recognition, adhesion, signal transduction, and cellular migration, that are crucial in all phases of neurogenesis. Despite intense investigation of CNS regeneration, the roles of GSLs in neural regeneration remain unclear. Here we focus on the respective potentials of glycolipids to promote regeneration and repair of the CNS. Mice lacking glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide or gangliosides show lethal phenotypes. More importantly, patients with ganglioside deficiencies exhibit severe clinical phenotypes. Further, neurodegenerative diseases and mental health disorders are associated with altered GSL expression. Accumulating studies demonstrate that GSLs not only delimit physical regions but also play central roles in the maintenance of the biological functions of neurons and glia. We anticipate that the ability of GSLs to modulate behavior of a variety of molecules will enable them to ameliorate biochemical and neurobiological defects in patients. The use of GSLs to treat such defects in the human CNS will be a paradigm-shift in approach since GSL-replacement therapy has not yet been achieved in this manner clinically.","['Biomedicine', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurochemistry']"

As per the doctors and researchers from the laboratory point of view, it will spread to a huge volume when humans are not followed certain principles. Moreover, this disease is easily transferred to neighbors and others in a short period which leads to death. To rectify the remedy for this virus, various spread countries and research peoples are creating the vaccines and some precautionary methods for living hood situation. Recent techniques are used to detect and monitoring the COVID-19–affected person’s lifestyle and insisting they take precaution steps for early pre-pandemic life. IoT is a framework that is used to generate data from the human body from the sensors opted for human conditions. Wearable devices have been created with these sensors and communicated with human bodies directly or indirectly. The generated data will send through the server using any connectivity techniques such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Analytics will be done at the server side for taking actions like the human body is affected by the COVID-19 virus or not. Finally, the generated data from a human can continuously store in real time in a cloud server which will be managed as a framework efficiently. This research work proposes a framework for data management in the early detection and monitoring of COVID-19 persons through IoT wearable devices in a pre-pandemic life. The experiments have been done at different zones, and the results are shown symptoms of COVID-19 disease. Parallel work reveals the data management in a cloud server since data have generated continuously in real time and tracking details also stored genuinely.

Furthermore, the aging population, the increment in obesity incidence, and the sedentary lifestyles are serious risk factors for bone diseases’ development which are associated with the self-regenerative process’s failure, high morbidity, and mortality rates. Thus, there is an ever-growing need for strategic approaches targeting bone replacement, its remodelling, and its regeneration. Bone scaffolds have successfully been used as synthetic bone grafts for many years, yet recent bone tissue engineering strategies attempt to explore their multifunctionality by investigating them as drug delivery systems. Bone diseases’ treatments can be substantially difficult due to the avascular nature of the surrounding cartilage; thus, targeted drug delivery to the bone can be advantageous: it provides local high drug concentrations and minimizes adverse effects while securing a space for new, healthy tissue growth. Despite the promising scientific progress, studies underlining bone scaffolds’ use as local drug delivery systems are not abundant. Hence, this work reviews bone scaffolds’ therapeutic interest for local drug delivery in five distinct bone disorders—osteomyelitis, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, osteosarcoma, and cancer bone metastasis. Additionally, it presents the challenges of this possible therapeutic approach and its future perspectives. Albeit bone scaffolds present therapeutic benefits by acting as drug delivery systems, further pre-clinical and clinical assessments are needed to strengthen their understanding and enable research evidence translation into clinical practice. The mismatch between scientific evolution and regulatory frameworks remains one of the major future challenges. Graphical abstract ","['Biomedicine', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences/Technology']"

T2DM is usually accompanied with obesity, insulin resistance (IR), inflammation, and oxidative stress. Development of T2DM usually starts from IR and metabolic impairment (prediabetes), which may exist for years before the clinical manifestation of the disease and T2DM diagnosis. Purinosome is an intricate system composed of numerous transporters, receptors, mediators, and catabolic and synthetic enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of purines. This biological system is linked with glucose and lipid metabolic pathways. It is believed that purinosome system enzymes and metabolites regulate insulin secretion and glucose metabolism and consequently are involved in the pathological mechanisms of T2DM development. Numerous studies have reported altered levels of purinsome-based metabolites and enzymes or their catabolic products in obese, prediabetic, and metabolic syndrome subjects. These components of the purine metabolism pathways can be considered early biomarkers for the screening, early diagnosis, and monitoring of diabetes and related complications. Some of them (e.g., isopentenyladenosine-5-monophosphate, uric acid, xanthine, and xanthine oxidase) were reported as T2DM predictive biomarkers. The altered level of key purine enzymes and related metabolites in relation to T2DM, prediabetes, and obesity is discussed in this chapter.","['Biomedicine', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Pharmacology/Toxicology']"

The Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI), launched in 2012, was used to monitor women’s inclusion in agricultural sector growth. Demand by WEAI users and the supply of tools and methods from researchers shaped the ongoing evolution of the tool to a shorter version and to another that reflected what agricultural development projects deemed meaningful to judge project success. Eventual modifications reflected user demand: a greater interest in market inclusion and value chains stimulated the development of specialized modules for market inclusion. WEAI-related metrics have demonstrated the importance of women’s empowerment for development outcomes, helping governments and civil society organizations design and implement gender-sensitive agricultural development programs. Finally, the adoption of SDG5 on women’s empowerment and gender equality created a demand for a measure of women’s empowerment for use by national statistical systems. Whether such a metric will be adopted globally will depend on the demand from, and utility to, stakeholders as well as existing capacity, capacity-building efforts, a belief in the intrinsic value of women’s empowerment, and the commitment of resources to attaining this goal.","['Economics', 'Agricultural Economics', 'Development Economics', 'Development Studies', 'Agriculture']"

An enquiry concerning the principles of morals, 1777 ed. Sec. VI, Part I, para, 196, 1777). Thus, even so-called “basic” emotions can be considered as moral emotions. As Haidt (The moral emotions.

A parametric study is performed to evaluate the optimal radius to lattice parameter ratio r/a  = 0.4 to obtain a large bandgap as well as gap to mid-gap ratio. By removing a sphere from the central lattice point, a defect is created within an otherwise perfect PnC. The supercell technique is employed to compute defect modes and band structure of defect PnC. These defect bands show strong vibrational modes within the spatial arrangement of the defect point and these defect frequencies appear to be flat ( dω/dk  = 0) in the band structure confirming energy localization at these modes. Also, while varying the radius of the defect sphere r d in the range of [0.1 a –0.5 a ], the number of defect modes within the bandgap tend to decrease, vanishing when r d equals 0.4 a and 0.5 a . To utilize the defect mode for energy harvesting, a small patch made of a piezoelectric material is attached onto the PnC device exactly above the defect. Introduction of this patch renders the band structure and defect modes to shift upwards compared to the defect PnC without the patch. A highly localized vibrational eigen mode is observed around 662 kHz in the band structure for the defect PnC with patch. The voltage response of this device is simulated by connecting a high resistance (open-circuit) to the patch and sweeping frequencies around the defect mode. This process produced a voltage of 2.8 V at 656.7 kHz for a 0.3 µm displacement excitation, thus demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed concept.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Despite the advances in technology, HBV has always been a crucial global health issue. Due to late detection of HBV, there were so many people who died. All the techniques we have to detect HBV are made up of huge device. So, developing smallest devices to detect the HBV has been clearly more important for convenience and growth. Variety of approaches has been used to develop better miniaturized device. This system consists of small-sized NFC sensor tag incorporated with a smartphone and antibody-modified electrode sensor. By EIS and CV, moderations and motion restriction process were verified (Kanchi et al. in Biosens Bioelectron 102:136–149, 2018 [ 1 ]). A user-friendly electrochemical device which is portable, economical is the most requiring element in electrochemical sensing to use in point-of-care approach. To make measuring units easier, connection which is wireless has been configured between smartphone and potentiostat called NFC interface that makes the potentiostat into passive operated device running without battery. Using amperometric detection, the hepatitis B antigen (HBsAg) was qualified with the help of NFC-based electrochemical immunosensor by measuring current from the redox couple before and after HBsAg usage. The proposed approach has shown a better performance with long-established immunoassays when the recurring HBV infected serum tested by sensor.

In this chapter, the accounts of sex workers and brothel operators are used to understand how sex work has become increasingly professionalised, both in the context of decriminalisation and the status of sex workers as independent contractors. Building on an international body of research that highlights common rules and norms used to maintain order in brothels, this chapter argues that operators use these to reinforce the status of sex workers as responsibilised professionals. At the same time, there is a tension between professionalisation and the marketing tactic of promoting commercial sexual services as authentic sexual encounters. This functions to limit the extent to which sex workers are able to manage their own labour, rendering them subject both to operators’ requirements of professionalised productivity and the expectations of clients to provide authentic experiences that situate sex work outside a professionalised realm.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime and Society', 'Critical Criminology', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Gender Studies', 'Social Policy', 'Politics of the Welfare State']"

Negative impacts include severe injuries and deaths. Although numerous machine learning models were proposed for fall detection, the formulations of the models are limited to prevent the occurrence of falls. Recently, the emerging research area namely early fall prediction receives an increasing attention. The major challenges of fall prediction are the long period of unseen future data and the nature of uncertainty in the time of occurrence of fall events. To extend the predictability (from 0.5 to 5 s) of the early fall prediction model, we propose a particle swarm optimization-based recurrent neural network and long short-term memory (RNN-LSTM). Results and analysis show that the algorithm yields accuracies of 89.8–98.2%, 88.4–97.1%, and 89.3–97.6% in three benchmark datasets UP Fall dataset, MOBIFALL dataset, and UR Fall dataset, respectively.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Treatment of high-grade stenosis in asymptomatic patients may have a role for primary prevention of strokes. Surgical treatment of a carotid stenosis itself carries the risk of causing a stroke. During carotid endarterectomy, most perioperative strokes are embolic in nature and amenable to preventative measures only. The obligatory clamping of the carotid artery during the endarterectomy also risks cerebral hypoperfusion due to the interruption of arterial inflow. Neuromonitoring serves to evaluate the functional or hemodynamic consequences of carotid clamping. The intraoperative clinical exam of a promptly responsive patient under loco-regional anesthesia, the electrophysiological exam with electroencephalography (EEG), somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEPs) and/or transcranial motor-evoked potential (tcMEPs) of a patient under general anesthesia, or measurement of cerebral blood flow with transcranial Doppler (TCD) provides reliable guidance on the adequacy of cerebral blood flow during carotid clamping. Cerebral oxygenation and measurement of stump pressure provide much less reliable information. When significant changes in monitoring despite adequate blood pressure indicate cerebral ischemia, insertion of a shunt can prevent global hemispheric ischemia. The level of anesthesia should remain constant prior to and during clamping of the carotid artery so that changes in monitoring can be easily attributed to changes in cerebral blood flow. Throughout the case, the primary means to prevent ischemia is maintaining systemic arterial blood flow: This entails selecting thoughtful blood pressure goals consistent with the patient’s baseline and pathology, not a generic normal value.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Anesthesiology', 'Neurosurgery', 'Pain Medicine']"

ANN is a parallel distributed network inspired by the biological nervous system and has the potential to learn and identify from experience to improve its performance. Therefore, a trained network can be utilised to classify and examine new data sets that show similar characteristics as that of trained data sets. By virtue of the potential capability of ANN, it can be used to solve both simple linear and complex nonlinear functions. But due to the gradient descent nature of the backpropagation algorithm, the problem of local minima arises and which acts as a great hindrance to the best solution. To overcome this, various evolutionary algorithms based on global minima were used in conjunction with ANN such as Particle Swarm Optimisation, Genetic Algorithm, Cuckoo Search (CS), etc. Cuckoo Search is a powerful meta-heuristic search algorithm derived from the reproduction strategy of the Cuckoo bird. The lesser number of parameters in CS makes it simple and potentially more genetic. This paper presents a method for damage detection in structures by amalgamating a flexible combination of Artificial Neural Network and Cuckoo Search algorithm. CS is employed with ANN to improve the training parameters (weight and bias) by minimising the difference between the real and desired output and these parameters were used for generating the network. For the study, a lattice structure is used to assess the robustness of the created network and this will be compared with efficiency in damage location and identification of the network created using ANN alone. The Study proved that ANN-CS outperforms ANN alone in damage identification, localisation, and quantification.","['Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences']"

We studied mice with or without diabetes in which hedgehog interacting protein (HHIP) was present or specifically knocked out in renal tubules ( Hhip RT -KO), hypothesising that local deficiency of HHIP in the renal tubules would attenuate tubular cell senescence, thereby preventing DKD tubulopathy. Methods Low-dose streptozotocin was employed to induce diabetes in both Hhip RT -KO and control ( Hhip fl/fl ) mice. Transgenic mice overexpressing Hhip in renal proximal tubular cells (RPTC) ( Hhip RPTC -Tg) were used for validation, and primary RPTCs and human RPTCs (HK2) were used for in vitro studies. Kidney morphology/function, tubular senescence and the relevant molecular measurements were assessed. Results Compared with Hhip fl/fl mice with diabetes, Hhip RT -KO mice with diabetes displayed lower blood glucose levels, normalised GFR, ameliorated urinary albumin/creatinine ratio and less severe DKD, including tubulopathy. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) expression was attenuated in RPTCs of Hhip RT -KO mice with diabetes compared with Hhip fl/fl mice with diabetes. In parallel, an increased tubular senescence-associated secretory phenotype involving release of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and activation of senescence markers (p16, p21, p53) in Hhip fl/fl mice with diabetes was attenuated in Hhip RT -KO mice with diabetes. In contrast, Hhip RPTC -Tg mice had increased tubular senescence, which was inhibited by canagliflozin in primary RPTCs. In HK2 cells, HHIP overexpression or recombinant HHIP increased SGLT2 protein expression and promoted cellular senescence by targeting both ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related-mediated cell arrest. Conclusions/interpretation Tubular HHIP deficiency prevented DKD-related tubulopathy, possibly via the inhibition of SGLT2 expression and cellular senescence.

The multiresolution approximation yields a hierarchical set of equations of motion involving the coarse component of generalized displacements, while additional equations of finer components are subsequently added. A coarse solution is first calculated, and finer solutions can be sequentially superimposed on the coarse solution until convergence to the final solution is achieved. Moreover, it is shown that each resolution can model specific bandwidths of wavenumbers, thus providing a unique capability to separate coexisting wave modes and detect converted and reflected waves in the presence of damage. Two wavelet-based beam elements are explored, the first encompasses the Timoshenko shear beam theory and the second a high-order layerwise laminate theory for the accurate prediction of both symmetric and antisymmetric guided waves. Numerical results illustrate the inherent property of the method to a priori localize and isolate coexisting guided wave modes and their conversions, induced by different material regions and weak or debonded layer interfaces, thus demonstrating the method’s intrinsic capabilities towards the design of wave-based SHM systems.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Here, we obtained the quantum generation rate ( q ) value of three SARS-CoV-2 variants (Alpha, Delta, and Omicron) for the Wells-Riley equation with a reproductive number-based fitted approach and estimated the association between the infection probability and ventilation rates. The q value was 89–165 h −1 for Alpha variant, 312–935 h −1 for Delta variant, and 725–2,345 h −1 for Omicron variant. The ventilation rates increased to ensure an infection probability of less than 1%, and were 8,000–14,000 m 3 h −1 , 26,000–80,000 m 3 h −1 , and 64,000–250,000 m 3 h −1 per infector for the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants, respectively.

Also, the prediction of the wing tip deflection can be highly useful to provide aircraft with improved maneuverability and agile response to sudden events, such as gust and flutter. In this study, we propose a wingtip deflection monitoring/prediction method based on machine learning techniques. Specifically, we employ an aerodynamic solver to simulate an aeroelastic flutter behavior of a fixed-wing, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to predict oscillatory wingtip motion due to the flutter. To track and predict the wingtip deflection, we build network architectures composed of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze optically measured data and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to process time-series information. As a result, we find the proposed technique is capable of monitoring and predicting wingtip deflection in an accurate and efficient manner. We expect this vision and machine-learning-based technique can complement existing sensor technologies to enhance the safety and maneuverability of aircraft.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

This combustion also emits trace amounts of hazardous substances such as mercury. Mercury is a global pollutant with the potential for long-range transport and ability to persist in the environment, bioaccumulate and cause toxicity. Controlling emissions of mercury from coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) is recognized by the Minamata Convention on Mercury as an important step in curbing the harmful effects of mercury to the environment and humans. India has been identified as one of the top emitters of mercury to the atmosphere, and coal combustion contributes to more than half of these emissions. Here, we discuss the current state of regulations on mercury emissions from CFPPs in India, the current information on mercury from CFPP stacks, and the possible way forward. Present data suggest that mercury specific emission control technologies are not required to comply with the regulatory requirements. As such, any reduction in mercury emissions will rely on co-benefits obtained from technologies to control emissions of other pollutants such as flue gas desulphurization, or methods to increase the efficiencies of CFPP such as coal washing. Additional reductions may be made from a business-as-usual scenario if the energy mix of India changes to renewable non-fossil fuel-based energy at an accelerated pace. Quantitative studies assessing the role of such climate change policies on mercury emissions reduction are recommended.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Physical Geography', 'Environmental Management', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

It acts as a transmitter for neuron communication in the brain. When a sufficient amount of dopamine is not released, the brain starts causing movement-related problems (motor symptoms) which lead to PD. The progression of PD in people changes from non-motor symptoms to motor symptoms. So, many researchers are trying to detect Parkinson’s disease at the preliminary stage, to halt the advancement of the disorder. A hybrid neuronal fuzzy classifier is proposed for early detection of PD by associating Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with Random Forest (RF). Different classification algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Gradient Boost (GB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) are employed for performance analysis. For testing, the UCI Machine Learning Repository’s Parkinson’s disease Classification Data Set was employed. The results showcased that the proposed neuronal fuzzy classifier has outperformed other competing traditional classifiers with a 96.23% overall accuracy.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Engineering Design', 'Machine Learning', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"
doi:10.1007/978-981-19-1029-6_23,en,Feasibility of Wearable Heart Rate Sensing-Based Whole-Body Physical Fatigue Monitoring for Construction Workers,OriginalPaper,"Since construction workers are often engaged in demanding whole-body physical activities for a prolonged period of time, whole-body fatigue (WBF) is one of the most common risks at construction sites that can detrimentally impact workers’ safety, health, and productivity. To continuously and less-invasively monitor WBF, the authors proposed a wearable biosensor-based method. The method first uses a wristband which can measure the wearer’s percentage of heart rate reserve (%HRR) over time to index the intensity of physical activity. Then, the critical power model (CP) is applied to track WBF from the %HRR data. The CP is a threshold for the intensity of physical activities to determine whether an ongoing physical activity is expending anaerobic energy, which leads to the accumulation of WBF. To test the proposed monitoring method’s feasibility, the authors collected data at a construction site from 12 workers over two days. During their daily work, the workers’ heart rates were continuously measured using a wristband and their perceived WBF was periodically surveyed. The authors conducted a correlation analysis between the fatigue index calculated by the proposed method and the self-reported WBF. Results showed that the two measurements showed a statistically meaningful correlation coefficient (0.61, p -value ≈ 0). This result indicates that the proposed method is feasible to monitor WBF trends among construction workers during their ongoing work. Given that most affordable wristbands include heart rate monitoring capacities, the authors expect the proposed method is easily applicable in real construction practice.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

This study aimed to compare the irregularity and nonlinearity of uterine electrical dynamics at term and preterm labor using entropy-based methods. We analyzed a dataset of EHG recordings corresponding to parturient women who attended the Maternal-Perinatal Hospital “Mónica Pretelini Sáenz,” Toluca, Mexico. Participants were classified as women in active labor at term (T = 30) and preterm labor (PT = 18). The raw EHG signals were analyzed using nonlinear entropy-based methods such as Multiscale Sample Entropy (MSE) and Phase Entropy (PhEn); MSE was evaluated in a range s  = 1 − 20 and PhEn for j  = 2 − 40. Additionally, nonlinearity tests were performed on the EHG data by applying a surrogate analysis. The main statistical differences were found in the lower scales of s and j for MSE and PhEn, respectively. Interestingly, nonlinearity was significantly diminished in the preterm group than in the term group. We concluded that reduced nonlinearity of EHG dynamics might indicate lower regulation in control systems that generate uterine action potentials in preterm labor. A clinical approach for assessing uterine activity in preterm labor may be established using nonlinear analysis of EHG.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering', 'Bioinformatics']"

In individuals with type 1 diabetes, these variants are associated with a higher C-peptide AUC, a lower glucose AUC during an OGTT, single autoantibody positivity near diagnosis, particularly in individuals older than 12 years of age, and a lower frequency of type 1 diabetes-associated HLA genotypes. Based on initial observations from clinical cohorts, we tested the hypothesis that type 2 diabetes-predisposing TCF7L2 genetic variants are associated with a higher percentage of residual insulin-containing cells (ICI%) in pancreases of donors with type 1 diabetes, by examining genomic data and pancreatic tissue samples from the Network for Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes (nPOD) programme. Methods We analysed nPOD donors with type 1 diabetes ( n= 110; mean±SD age at type 1 diabetes onset 12.2±7.9 years, mean±SD diabetes duration 15.3±13.7 years, 53% male, 80% non-Hispanic White, 12.7% African American, 7.3% Hispanic) using data pertaining to residual beta cell number; quantified islets containing insulin-positive beta cells in pancreatic tissue sections; and expressed these values as a percentage of the total number of islets from each donor (mean ± SD ICI% 9.8±21.5, range 0–92.2). Results Donors with a high ICI% (≥5) ( n= 30; 27%) vs a low ICI% (<5) ( n= 80; 73%) were older at onset (15.3±6.9 vs 11.1±8 years, p =0.013), had a shorter diabetes duration at donor tissue procurement (7.0±7.4 vs 18.5±14.3 years, p <0.001), a higher African ancestry score (0.2±0.3 vs 0.1±0.2, p =0.043) and a lower European ancestry score (0.7±0.3 vs 0.9±0.3, p =0.023). After adjustment for age of onset ( p= 0.105), diabetes duration ( p< 0.001), BMI z score ( p =0.145), sex ( p= 0.351) and African American race ( p= 0.053), donors with the TCF7L2 rs7903146 T allele (TC or TT, 45.5%) were 2.93 times (95% CI 1.02, 8.47) more likely to have a high ICI% than those without it (CC) ( p= 0.047). Conclusions/interpretation Overall, these data support the presence of a type 1 diabetes endotype associated with a genetic factor that predisposes to type 2 diabetes, with donors in this category exhibiting less severe beta cell loss. It is possible that in these individuals the disease pathogenesis may include mechanisms associated with type 2 diabetes and thus this may provide an explanation for the poor response to immunotherapies to prevent type 1 diabetes or its progression in a subset of individuals. If so, strategies that target both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes-associated factors when they are present may increase the success of prevention and treatment in these individuals.

Coastal populations face a range of climate-related risks such as cyclones, sea-level rise, and coastal flooding. The built environment has a significant impact over the local climate and environment of coastal communities. Coastal areas are identified to be central locations of human habitats creating coastal urban centres further enhances the risk. Therefore, developing substantial climate adaptation strategies for the built environment in coastal regions is essential. In developing suitable adaptation measures, it is essential to understand the impacts of climate change on the coastal built environment in detail. This research is conducted as a part of a colloborative research project BEACON (Built Environment leArning for Climate adaptation), co-financed by the European Union Erasmus + programme. This study conducted a detailed review of the climate change impact on the built environment in coastal regions. A systematic literature review based on three academic databases Science Direct, Emerald Insight and Scopus, was conducted. The synthesised data were analysed using the thematic analysis technique, and the climate change impacts were mainly categorised as physical and non-physical impacts. The primary climate change evidence in coastal regions is sea level rise, weather conditions, and precipitation changes. The associated disaster risks and their physical and non-physical (economic, social, and environmental) impacts in the coastal regions have been summarised into a single framework. This could be used as a basis to develop tangible climate adaptation measures in the coastal built environment.","['Engineering', 'Fire Science, Hazard Control, Building Safety', 'Natural Hazards', 'Sustainable Development']"

Several types of ICP monitors are commercially available. Intraventricular catheter (external ventricular drain, EVD) is often considered the ""gold standard"" for ICP monitoring. Besides numeric data, the ICP waveform can be analyzed to assess intracranial compliance and cerebral autoregulatory capacity. In patients with indwelling ICP monitors, it is important to ensure that the monitoring is continued uninterrupted during transport as well as during surgery or endovascular intervention.

Structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques based on the measurement of ultrasonic guided waves are expected to evaluate the reliability of the aging heat-resistant structures at high temperatures. However, since commercial piezoelectric acousto-ultrasonic actuators and sensors have a limited heat resistance up to 200 ℃, they are inapplicable to establishing the high-temperature SHM. Optical fiber acoustic sensors (OFAS) are potential candidates for high-temperature acoustic sensing because they are made from silica glass that withstands temperatures exceeding 1000 °C. As one type of OFAS, fiber-optic Bragg grating (FBG) sensing systems have been developed to detect ultrasonic waves with a high sensitivity comparable to the PZT sensors. The purpose of this research is to build a high-temperature in-situ damage diagnosis using a laser ultrasonic visualization system combined with a remote FBG-based sensing configuration. In this method, an ultrasonic wave is excited by the laser irradiation on the surface of a material and then received by the remotely installed FBG sensor. Because both wave excitation and wave sensing parts have excellent heat resistance, the proposed system enables a stable ultrasonic measurement at elevated temperatures. In this article, the ultrasonic visualization was demonstrated in a specimen of heat-resistant material at a temperature of 1000 °C. A wavenumber-frequency analysis based on a three-dimensional Fourier transform was also conducted to extract the wave components corresponding to the reflection caused by an artificial defect in the specimen. As a result, the filtered visualization results enabled precise damage detection in the high-temperature environment.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Structural Materials', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

An investigation using ambient vibration measurement with eleven sensors in a deck panel was conducted to study the effect of damages on vibrational characteristics and dynamic parameters of the deck slabs of a real bridge. The investigation was carried out at three different deck panel locations, namely Panels 1, 2 and 3, with different levels of deterioration. To obtain the modal parameters, Eigenvalue Realization Algorithm (ERA) combined with Random Decrement (RD) technique was employed. The natural frequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes were used to describe the dynamic characteristic of deck panels. Of all modal characteristics, the sensitivity of damping ratio to damage has been proven to be highest with no requirement of numerous measurement locations for its identification (Cao et al. in Smart Mater Struct 26:043001, 2017). In this study, amplitude dependence of damping ratio was also investigated, since a change in the modal damping ratio can be used for damage identification but its dependence on amplitude remains a concern. The analytical study, through the method of Finite Element (FE), was also conducted, and the natural frequencies and mode shapes were extracted taking one deck panel as the focus of study. In addition, this study presents a closer look at the stabilization diagrams of all deck panels with different levels of deterioration.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Structural Materials', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

However, the continuous occurrence of several bioprocesses results in the generation of considerable quantity of leachates with high concentration of heavy metals in addition to other organic and inorganic compounds. Seepage of such leachates containing heavy metal ions contaminates nearby environment and ground which causes severe health problems and unhygienic environment for living beings.

The extensive experimental study is performed on emphasizing adsorption characteristics of soil–bentonite mixture when in contact with leachate of different concentrations and at varying durations. Variation in adsorption characteristics was assessed by using batch adsorption and column testing studies. Several adsorption isotherm models were utilized to fit the experimental data for varying presumptions to be taken into consideration for the considered clay liner-leachate interactions.

Some may perceive ‘luxury’ when the state of satisfaction or delight is achieved, whereas for others, ‘luxury’ may be experienced when one feels an enhancement in his/her well-being resulting from a service experience. However, service providers nowadays are also trying to enhance customer well-being which is considered something beyond customer satisfaction as per contemporary service literature. Therefore, this research aims to re-interpret luxury hospitality from the experienscape perspective to predict perceived well-being (a human-centric outcome) through customer satisfaction (a behavioral affective reaction) in the context of Malaysian beach resort hotels. Using a questionnaire as a research instrument, data was collected from beach resort hotel guests who stayed at any one of the fifteen 5-star and 4-star beach resort hotels located in Langkawi, Malaysia. A total of 306 responses were obtained from the beach resort hotel guests, using a convenience and snowball sampling approach. A significant and positive effect of functional, natural, and cultural experienscape on customer satisfaction was found, while sensory and social experienscape had a non-significant impact on customer satisfaction. Also, there was a significant and positive effect of social and natural experienscape on perceived well-being, while sensory, functional, and cultural experienscape had a non-significant effect on perceived well-being. Moreover, there was a significant impact of customer satisfaction on perceived well-being and customer satisfaction also mediates the relationship between experienscape components and perceived well-being. Our findings are theoretically meaningful as it is the first empirical research that translated ‘luxury’ through the interaction between experienscape and perceived well-being through the mediation of customer satisfaction in the context of beach resort hotels.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

These networks convey sensitive and private data items that are exchanged between the sensors and medical servers over public channels. Some of the transmitted data include heart rate, blood oxygen, body temperature, blood pressure, electromyogram and electrocardiogram. Upon receiving these signals, the medical staff or actuators take some appropriate actions, such as drug injections. Since public channels are deployed during signal transfers, attackers can perform malicious activities to the transmitted data, which may lead to erroneous responses from the medical staff. As such, it is critical that strong security and privacy protection be implemented during these transfers. Although many security protocols have been presented in literature based on methods such as digital signatures, advanced encryption standards and elliptic curve cryptography, their deployment in wireless body area networks is detrimental due to their high computational complexities. As such, the design of an efficient algorithm that offers trust, security and privacy provisioning in these networks is still an open challenge. In this paper, a wireless body area network-based algorithm is developed based on symmetric key cryptography and elliptic curve point multiplications. The security analysis shows that this scheme is resilient against power analysis-based side-channeling attacks. In addition, it offers mutual authentication, anonymity, backward and forward key secrecy and is robust against impersonation and packet replays among other attack vectors. Moreover, performance evaluation shows that it has the lowest computation costs and relatively lower bandwidth requirements compared with similar protocols.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Acute innate and also adaptive or antibody-mediated immune cell responses both drive damage to kidney transplants. These immune responses are central to allograft rejection and transplant failure. While treatment for acute rejection has advanced greatly, ongoing or chronic immune damage from inflammation and antibody-mediated rejection remains a significant problem, leading to transplant loss. There are limited numbers of organs available for transplant, and preventing chronic graft damage will allow for longer graft stability and function, reducing the need for repeat transplantation. Chemokine–GAG interactions are the basis for initial immune responses, forming directional gradients that allow immune cells to traverse the vascular endothelium and enter engrafted organs. Targeting chemokine–GAG interactions thus has the potential to reduce immune damage to transplanted kidneys. Mouse models for renal transplant are available, but are complex and require extensive microsurgery expertise. Here we describe simplified subcapsular and subcutaneous renal allograft transplant models, for rapid assessment of the roles of chemokine–GAG interactions during allograft surgery and rejection. These models are described, together with treatment using a unique chemokine modulating protein (CMP) M-T7 that disrupts chemokine–GAG interactions.","['Biomedicine', 'Immunology', 'Cell Biology']"

This introductory chapter presents a review of the two major types of ideas of social work: theory and ethics. Two forms of theory are identified, namely ‘theory for practice’ (that is, theories developed in separate areas of inquiry that are brought to the concerns of social work) and ‘practice theory’ (that is, theories that are developed from the conscious and systematic reflection on practice). The chapter then looks at ethics, first in the ethical principles that have their origins outside social work, and then in critical analysis of specific ethical issues that are encountered in practice, including those now emerging. In this sense, both types of ideas have aspects that are brought into and those that are developed within social work. There is also an interplay between social work theory and ethics, with some common themes that reflect the focus of social workers on the origins of the structural issues and personal problems with which social workers intervene and ways to address such issues and problems. In this way, bringing theory and ethics together as ‘the ideas of social work’ reveals the continuities between the ways in which sense is made of questions concerning the what, how and why of social work.","['Education', 'Education, general', 'Social Work', 'Social Work and Community Development', 'Ethics']"

The Internet of things relies on resource-limited devices ranging from domestic appliances to personal devices. There is an ever-increasing number of device connected to the Internet every day that attract the attention of hackers. Adversaries deploy a range of advanced persistent threat (APT) strategies to successfully compromise these systems, one of which is the botnet attack. The IoT is potentially vulnerable to attacks launched by intelligent botnets, since these botnets detect network weaknesses and exploit them for the launch of different attacks similar to DDoS attacks. In order to provide efficient security against botnet attack to the IoT devices and network, several methods have emerged; recent and most effective mechanism is a deep learning mechanism. Our paper reviewed the security threats in IoT and several existing deep learning approaches to address the detection of botnets in the IoT environment. Furthermore, we also investigated the attack class, datasets, merits and demerits of existing deep learning approaches.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The way we live is intrinsically connected with our survival, and the contemporaneous model of work is locally as globally unsustainable. The pandemic context of Covid-19 and the need to physical distance introduce, in practice, a new way of living and working with Telework. Supported by ICT, telework, as the work performed from home, was perceived as a positive experience validated by the number of individuals who expects to have a hybrid form of work in a post-pandemic context. This new reality, with a new form of work and the need to mitigate the spread of the virus, questions the future of the workplace. The relationship between ICT and Telework evidences the idea of smart workplace. A smart workplace is a sustainable and inclusive environment where the work on-site blends with the remote one, providing security, health, comfort, and wellbeing to users along with encouraging human interactions despite their nature. The paradigm shift that we experience is an opportunity and a challenge to the creative cluster, since from the model of work to the attributes of the workplace, all need to be re-imagined and re-designed to guarantee a positive experience to the user. This is a position paper supporting the need to reimagine the workplace after a positive experience granted by technology during the pandemic context.

The proposed driver distraction model for heavy vehicles examines the influence of environmental, psychological, and vehicle design factors on driver performance. The main ergonomic risk factors include long driving hours, poor human–machine interface, incorrect driving posture, vibration due to bad road conditions, driver sleepiness and age. To evaluate the effect of these factors on driving performance which leads to MSDs, different ergonomic methods/techniques are available. Selecting a single tool from these methods is quite difficult due to the heterogeneity of driver ergonomic parameters. To find the optimum tool, different features of the ergonomic methods were identified and compared. Integration of these tools used for ergonomic analysis was an outcome of the advancements in machine learning technology which resulted in digital human modelling (DHM).

In order to verify the compliance with safety standards, pyroshock tests are employed. Based on launch vehicle characteristics, the requirements for the qualification of space equipment are usually established following the NASA-STD-7003A international standards in terms of a Shock Response Spectrum (SRS) representing the damage potential of the shock. Laboratory tests should then match the actual stress conditions reached during a real launch. Historically, this was obtained by means of explosive charges (hence the name “pyroshock”). Nevertheless, to foster repeatability and safety in laboratories, hammers or bullets are commonly used in nowadays shock testing machines. In this work, a resonant fixture test bench is considered. In this very common layout, a resonant metallic plate is interposed between the impact location and the test component so as to better simulate the shocks. The response of the resonant plate - which determines the required shock response spectrum - is currently empirically tuned by adding masses, damping, stiffness, or by varying the nature of the impact. This study aimed at developing a numerical model able to completely simulate a pyroshock test. Such a model can be used both for designing and for tuning the test bench so as to easily match different SRS requirements for different components under test. This leads to great economical advantages as can cut the calibration times leading to more efficient and effective testing.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Thriving involves the individual, relational, and aspirational development necessary to pursue a life purpose that is meaningful to the self and one’s surroundings. Meaning-making is the process of constructing and internalizing abstract beliefs (about oneself, the world, and one’s priorities) into salient values that contribute to the moral development necessary to thrive. When youth consider abstract ideas in the context of their actions, transcendent emotions, and the broader world, then their meaning-making can result in values-based goals and behaviors. Adolescents are naturally motivated to explore identity-related issues of meaning, values, roles, and belonging. In particular, meaning-making occurs when youth are given the opportunity to reflect in an enriching dialogue with caring adults. In more ways than most youth contexts, religion and spirituality provide young people with opportunities to seek and form meaning by being prompted to process transcendent beliefs and emotions through the narratives, intergenerational relationships, and transcendent experiences that religion and spirituality often provide.","['Psychology', 'Positive Psychology', 'Religion and Psychology']"

Recent research suggests the use of acoustic emissions (AE) using ultrasonic sensors to detect wire break events in civil engineering structures. In this work, accelerometers operating in the audible frequency range (<17 kHz) are used to record more than hundred wire breaks manually conducted at two old girders taken from a demolished bridge in Roding, Germany. Based on these experiments, approximately twelve days of continuous operational recordings conducted at a similar bridge construction in Hagen, Germany and additional wire breaks recorded at the bridge structure in Roding before demolition, we train and evaluate a support vector machine to detect wire break events in bridge tendons using low-level frequency domain features such as the spectral bandwidth. On the evaluation dataset, we achieve a recall score of more than 90% while having a FP-rate of approximately ten events per day. It should be noted that using low-frequency acoustic emissions we are able to detect wire break events in distances up to more than 20 m.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

However, reasoning with numerical values remains challenging for phenotyping in clinical text, for example, temperature 102F representing Fever. Current state-of-the-art phenotyping models are able to detect general phenotypes, but perform poorly when they detect phenotypes requiring numerical reasoning. We present a novel unsupervised methodology leveraging external knowledge and contextualized word embeddings from ClinicalBERT for numerical reasoning in a variety of phenotypic contexts. Comparing against unsupervised benchmarks, it shows a substantial performance improvement with absolute gains on generalized Recall and F1 scores up to 79% and 71%, respectively. In the supervised setting, it also surpasses the performance of alternative approaches with absolute gains on generalized Recall and F1 scores up to 70% and 44%, respectively.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This ultimately increased the scale and complexity of chemicals, as well as the alignment of unit operations. The use of hazardous materials, on the other hand, have the potential to create a hazardous accident, which can affect the environment, human health, and assets during production, storage, and transportation. Nowadays, the widespread use of hazardous chemicals in industrial processes, and the associated accidents, create fear in the society, and made such industries unpopular as unsafe. As a result, the risk of harmful chemical mishaps can be predicted using the 3D CFD consequence analysis technique that helps to understand the accident consequence on the system. Therefore, in the present study accidental releases of toxic chlorine gas from storage shades with various systems considered as a hypothetical case to understand and evaluate the consequences of the accidents using a 3D CFD analysis approach. The current paper analysis is mainly focused on analyzing the effect of various wind conditions and leak size in the existence with and without obstacles using GEXCON FLACS CFD code. The FLACS CFD code's capacity to reasonably accurately repeat the results was demonstrated through validation against comparable experiments. Also, the results of the current analysis could help theoretical and simulation basis for the industries for the establishment of chlorine storage in open or in close spaces.","['Engineering', 'Materials Engineering', 'Mineralogy', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering']"

A Personal Account of Two New Prison Design Projects,OriginalPaper,"This chapter describes two personal experiences of being part of teams planning and designing new prisons: one in Auckland, New Zealand; one in Limerick, Ireland. In many ways, the prisons were at opposite ends of the penal spectrum in terms of their geographic location, their function, and in relation to their divergent paths from commissioning to the outcome. Only one of the facilities is likely to turn out to be an example of imaginative, humane thinking in contemporary prison design, even though both prisons were initially conceived as such. Put simply, where Auckland East fell foul of a highly risk-averse and security-obsessed corrections culture, Limerick has benefitted from a prison service prepared to take risks and commission a design that is underpinned by research evidence and international best practice. Nonetheless, the experiences that I relate in the chapter underline that, however good the intentions of prison commissioners, planners and architects, the design of the built environment can only go so far in creating a rehabilitative culture in prison.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

Changes in UCL morphology and pathology occur with long-term pitching, with more severe findings at higher competition levels. We examined the bilateral differences and the relationship between UCL morphology, pathology, and ulnohumeral joint laxity in asymptomatic collegiate pitchers using ultrasound. Materials and methods Division I college pitchers ( n  = 41) underwent ultrasound scans of their bilateral medial elbows, both at rest and in a valgus-stressed position. The presence of enthesopathy, calcifications, and degeneration was assessed qualitatively. UCL thickness and ulnohumeral joint gap were measured with online calipers. The bilateral differences were analyzed using paired t -tests and chi-square analysis, and the relationships between thickness, gapping, and degenerative changes were analyzed using regression analyses. Results The throwing arm demonstrated greater distal UCL thickness (mean difference (MD) = 0.2 mm (95%CI = 0.1–0.3), p  < 0.01), resting and stressed gap (MD = 0.3 mm (95%CI = 0.0–0.7), p  = 0.04; MD = 0.4 (95%CI = 0.0–0.9), p  = 0.02), and greater prevalence of degeneration and enthesopathy ( p  = 0.03) compared bilaterally. Enthesopathy and calcifications predicted increased distal UCL thickness ( p  = 0.04; p  = 0.02). Degenerative scores predicted increased stressed-resting ulnohumeral joint gap ( p  < 0.01). Conclusion In the throwing arms of collegiate pitchers, ultrasound demonstrated UCL thickening, enthesopathy/intra-ligamentous calcification, and greater laxity of the ulnohumeral joint relative to the non-throwing arm. Degeneration of the UCL, not thickness, was related to greater elbow joint gapping. This study demonstrates the utility of ultrasound for examining sonographic characteristics of the UCL in a sample of college pitchers.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Imaging / Radiology', 'Orthopedics', 'Pathology', 'Nuclear Medicine']"

Here we provide an overview of these findings, focusing on measures that have traditionally been thought to reflect synaptic spine density or synaptic activity and that are relevant for understanding if there is lower synaptic density in the disorder. We conducted literature searches to identify meta-analyses or other relevant studies in patients with chronic or first-episode schizophrenia, or in people at high genetic or clinical risk for psychosis. We identified 18 meta-analyses including over 50,000 subjects in total, covering: structural MRI measures of gyrification index, grey matter volume, grey matter density and cortical thickness, neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging, PET imaging of regional glucose metabolism and magnetic resonance spectroscopy measures of N-acetylaspartate. We also review preclinical evidence on the relationship between ex vivo synaptic measures and structural MRI imaging, and PET imaging of synaptic protein 2A (SV2A). These studies show that schizophrenia is associated with lower grey matter volumes and cortical thickness, accelerated grey matter loss over time, abnormal gyrification patterns, and lower regional SV2A levels and metabolic markers in comparison to controls (effect sizes from ~ −0.11 to −1.0). Key regions affected include frontal, anterior cingulate and temporal cortices and the hippocampi. We identify several limitations for the interpretation of these findings in terms of understanding synaptic alterations. Nevertheless, taken with post-mortem findings, they suggest that schizophrenia is associated with lower synaptic density in some brain regions. However, there are several gaps in evidence, in particular whether SV2A findings generalise to other cohorts.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Psychiatry', 'Neurosciences', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Biological Psychology']"

Studies have shown improved outcomes and decreased length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay for patients treated in a dedicated neurologic intensive care unit (Neuro ICU), likely secondary to specialized nursing care, neurointensivist teams, and protocolized management of complex neurologic illness. When it comes to monitoring a patient in the Neuro ICU, there is a wide variety of tools and parameters we record to help guide treatment plans and communicate prognostic information to patients and families. Some examples of neuromonitoring typically performed in a Neuro ICU include intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), transcranial Doppler (TCD), electroencephalograms (EEGs), brain tissue oxygenation, and pupillometry. The purpose of monitoring patients in the neurocritical care unit is to detect, prevent, and treat reversible causes of further brain injury.

Genetic differentiation between WNV lineages is usually performed by complete genome sequencing, which is not available in many research and diagnostic laboratories. In this chapter, we describe a protocol for detection and analysis of WNV samples by sequencing the entire region of their structural genes capsid (C), preM/membrane, and envelope. The primary step is the detection of WNV RNA by quantitative PCR of the NS2A gene or the C gene regions. Next, the entire region containing the structural protein genes is amplified by PCR. The primary PCR product is then amplified again in parallel reactions, and these secondary PCR products are sequenced. Finally, bioinformatic analysis enables detection of mutations and classification of the samples of interest. This protocol is designed to be used by any laboratory equipped for endpoint and quantitative PCR. The sequencing can be performed either in-house or outsourced to a third-party service provider. This protocol may therefore be useful for rapid and affordable classification of WNV samples, obviating the need for complete genome sequencing.","['Biomedicine', 'Virology']"

This technological advancement makes it possible to serve emerging applications, such as financial transactions, healthcare check-ups, and property access, easily through smart wearables, such as Apple Watch. This also presents a new vulnerability as hackers have more opportunities to attack users via the wearables. As the current knowledge-based wearable authentication schemes, such as passwords, PINs, or pattern locks, are overwhelming for users, we need an authentication system that can validate a user implicitly, i.e., without the need for active user interaction. In this work, we present an authentication system for the wearables leveraging the sensing and computation power of smartphones and IoT connectivity. We develop a smartphone application ( TFL Auth app) using the TensorFlow Lite framework and an on-phone convolutional neural network (CNN) model that listens to a user’s breathing patterns through the microphone and verifies the user’s identity in real-time before sending the acceptance/rejection notification to a paired wearable that we want to secure. From a detailed analysis, we are able to achieve an average accuracy of 0.92 ± 0.01 using the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Professional Computing']"

In recent times, there has been a lot of interest in using computer-aided techniques to classify medical images. The current study explores the efficacy of an Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD)-based mammographic image classification technique to identify the benign and the malignant lumps in the images. We further present a novel leader recognition (LR) technique which aids in the classification process to identify the most benign and malignant images from their respective cohort in the training set. The effect of image diversity in training sets on classification efficacy is also studied by considering training sets of different sizes. The proposed classification technique is found to identify malignant images with up to $$80\%$$ 80 % sensitivity and also provides a maximum F 1 score of $$72.73\%$$ 72.73 % .","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Information Storage and Retrieval']"

Critical assets such as bridges, tunnels, roads and sluices are approaching the end of their theoretical lifetime and the costs for renovation and replacement are rising rapidly. Asset owners are increasingly looking to make the transition from corrective or preventive maintenance to condition-based, predictive maintenance. By using a data-driven approach to asset management, the actual state of an asset can be understood better, maintenance can be optimized and the remaining lifetime estimated more accurately, whilst always guaranteeing the continued safety of the asset. The current methods for monitoring the behavior of civil infrastructure are not scalable to meet the needs of the industry in the coming decades. They either require labor-intensive manual inspections, or large numbers of electronic sensors involving complex, hazardous installation and maintenance procedures. Fugro has developed TotaLite ® , a novel optical sensing system to overcome many of the issues associated with conventional deformation monitoring methods. TotaLite ® combines innovative optics, smart image analysis algorithms and IoT data processing technology to deliver accurate contactless monitoring of displacements and deformations. Compared to existing deformation monitoring techniques, TotaLite ® is easier to install, less invasive and uses less energy. It provides significant cost savings for existing projects, but will also make monitoring feasible for applications where currently no cost-effective methods exist at all. We present the measurement principles and data processing architecture underlying TotaLite ® , as well as results of the first trials, comparing TotaLite ® with existing monitoring techniques.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Recently, they have been successfully used to monitor the strain profiles at the interface between concrete and steel or composite rebars during pullout tests. In the framework of durability studies on Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymer reinforcing bars (rebars), this method offers interesting perspectives for monitoring the evolution of the concrete/rebar bond behavior under accelerated ageing conditions. However, the durability of the bonded DOFS instrumentation itself should be investigated in a preliminary stage, to assess possible alteration of its performance over aging, which would raise questions about the validity of strain measurements in the long term. This article presents the first results of an experimental program aiming to address this specific issue. In this work, steel rebars were equipped with bonded optical fibers. Half-length of the instrumented rebars was subjected to hydrothermal ageing by immersion in an alkaline solution, while the remaining length was exposed to standard laboratory conditions. After exposure, the rebars were tested in tension and the DOFS strain profiles were simultaneously measured. These strain profiles were then compared to reference measurements performed before ageing, providing insights on the influence of the ageing conditions on the response of the DOFS.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The number of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomies (LSGs) performed globally has increased markedly and has become “trendy” among bariatric surgeons in the last few years [1]. LSG has attained its position as the primary procedure of choice in bariatric surgery for morbid obesity. In this procedure, 80% of the stomach, mainly the body and fundus are removed longitudinally, leaving behind a sleeve of the stomach along the lesser curve [2, 3]. The procedure can be performed by minimally invasive approaches as well as single incision access or even robotic surgery with comparable results [4, 5]. The weight loss is achieved by restricting the food entering the stomach. Another factor in the effectiveness of weight loss in sleeve gastrectomy is the decrease in blood levels of ghrelin, “the hormone that stimulates hunger,” and a majority of cells responsible for producing this hormone is found in the fundus which is removed during this procedure. This procedure can be performed as the first stage in more complex bariatric cases including cases of super-obesity before procedures like Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or the duodenal switch can be performed [6]. The objective is to achieve an initial weight loss that would help to perform more extensive mixed restrictive or malabsorptive procedures safely and effectively [7–9].","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Minimally Invasive Surgery', 'Colorectal Surgery', 'Imaging / Radiology', 'Surgery']"

In most applications, a smooth surface finishing is preferred since rough surfaces are prone to corrosion attacks and fatigue crack incubation. Therefore, surface finishing is necessary to reduce the surface roughness of AM parts before they are used. The roughness of outer surfaces can be measured directly, using either contact stylus profilometer or non-contact optical microscope. However, there are still challenges to quantify the roughness of the internal surfaces using these conventional techniques of surface metrology. In this paper, we present a method to measure the roughness of internal channels by analyzing ultrasonic signals from the backwall reflection. A frequency-domain technique based on phase-screen approximation is used to reconstruct the root mean square ( $$R_{q}$$ R q ) value from the ultrasonic signal scattered from the rough surfaces. Finite element simulations are developed to demonstrate the method, showing excellent accuracy when the $$R_{q}$$ R q value is within 1/15 of the wavelength of the incident ultrasound. The method is then applied to monitor the surface roughness of the internal channels during the Abrasive Flow Machining (AFM) process. The reconstructed roughness value shows a clear and steady downward trend during the polishing process, quantitatively indicating the polishing rate. This demonstrates that such ultrasonic method can be used as a tool to provide feedback controls in the polishing process.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

The most common applications of TCD include diagnosis and monitoring of cerebral vasospasm in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), detection and follow-up of stenosis/occlusion of major intracranial arteries including response to thrombolytic therapy in stroke, detection of cerebral microemboli, perioperative monitoring during carotid revascularization, diagnosing right-to-left cardiac shunts, determination of stroke risk in sickle cell disease, cerebral vasomotor and autoregulation testing, and confirmation of cerebral circulatory arrest in brain death. A major limitation of TCD ultrasonography is the absence of “ acoustic windows ” leading to a failure of insonation in 8–10% individuals.

The increased use of connected medical devices makes such an ecosystem more vulnerable and increases the cyber-attack surface. Traditional security methods are insufficient to deal with such a high degree of interconnected medical and IoT devices. There is a need for security approaches based on concepts of collaboration, cooperation, autonomy and dynamism to ensure timely security of the whole healthcare ecosystem. This work adopts swarm-based principles with multi-agent systems to meet collaboration, distribution and robustness requirements, thus improving the healthcare ecosystem’s security. The paper presents a swarm-based agent-to-agent communication model founded on the collaboration among primary and supervisor agents to acquire new knowledge related to the healthcare ecosystem. The proposed model is based on the direct collaboration between primary agents that provides supervisor agents with local security-related information and the indirect collaboration between supervisor agents that exchange stigmergic information through the environment to make a collectively informed decision. The communication model is implemented using the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) approach.

However, the utility of AC in patients with pathologic lymph node (pLN)-negative disease is unclear. Our aim is to assess the value of AC stratified by pLN status. Methods The US Rectal Cancer Consortium database (2007–2017) was retrospectively reviewed for patients with clinical stage II and III rectal adenocarcinoma who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation (NACR) and curative-intent resection. Those who received neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy or underwent local resection were excluded. Patients were categorized by pLN status. Primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Results Of 213 patients, 70% had pLN-negative disease and 30% pLN-positive disease. Median age was 57 years, 65% were male, and median follow-up was 31 months. Among patients with pLN-negative disease, 74% received AC. Receipt of AC was not associated with improved 5-year OS (82% versus 74%, respectively; p = 0.16). This finding persisted on multivariable analysis. Of patients with pLN-positive disease, 83% received AC. Patients with pLN-positive disease demonstrated improved 5-year OS with receipt of AC (72% compared with 0% with no adjuvant chemotherapy, p = 0.04). Conclusion After receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiation, adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with pLN-negative disease does not appear to be associated with improved survival. Further validation and prospective studies are needed to evaluate the utility of adjuvant chemotherapy in this setting.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery']"

In this perspective, Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) is a proactive method to industrial services enhancing maintenance according to the health of the system. PHM entails diagnostic and prognostic engineering tools to recognize the health of the system, and then to choose the prime maintenance actions. The diagnostic tool has to be capable to handle a sizeable volume of data and determine, by means of processing algorithms, the proper set needed for the analysis. The software named MADe can be used as a helpful utility to engineers; it is a model-based toolkit for Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety (RAMS) analysis, capable of optimizing maintenance activities based on the information given by the software, relating to sensor choice and to maintenance strategies. In the PHM framework, the detection of incipient failures is central task of the monitoring the health status of systems that include components sensitive to fatigue or aging. In fact, timely diagnosis allows to schedule maintenance reducing the impact on production outcomes. Based on these considerations, the present paper explains a technique for detecting incipient failures in fatigue sensitive parts, by means of an Equivalent Damage Index (EDI), that can be calculated from the measured signals on the real plant.

Drawing on the literature on prostitution policy in Europe, the feminist literature on prostitution and trafficking in women and EU Gender Studies, I argue that the EP’s neo-abolitionist turn can be explained by the coalescence in the mid-1990s of three key factors: Sweden’s accession to the EU and the attendant positioning of Swedish feminist neo-abolitionist norm entrepreneurs in central positions of power within EU institutions; the consolidation of a feminist neo-abolitionist velvet triangle through the creation of strong institutional links between the EC, EP and EWL, which remained unchallenged, and the articulation of a neoliberal model of gender and sexual emancipation within the violence against women policies of the EU that strongly resonated with neo-abolitionist ideals, all the while neo-abolitionism itself became gradually associated to gender equality as a fundamental EU value. In addition, I argue that this proclivity of the EU’s violence against women policies towards neo-abolitionism results from the operation of what I call the neoliberalism–vulnerability–security nexus , to refer to the imbrication of security as a technology of neoliberal governmentality, through the related role of the notion of vulnerability, with the gender and sexual politics of neoliberalism.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Politics and Gender', 'European Politics', 'International Security Studies']"

Compared to the state-of-the-art inspection methods of these structures using ultrasonic bulk wave phased array techniques, guided waves provide a mechanism for monitoring inaccessible areas and increasing the testing range to speed up the inspection process. Combining these two approaches, an efficient inspection scheme can be achieved. For this purpose, in this work, the possibility of exciting a single higher order guided wave mode at a low dispersion region is examined, using a conventional linear phased array on a 10 mm thick sample. An analytical model based on modal analysis is derived. Then, the time delays across each element of the array are optimally selected and a necessary condition on the pitch is provided, to enhance the purity of the desired mode. The results are promising, illustrating that single mode excitation is possible at high frequency-thickness products, greater or equal than 15 MHz $$\cdot $$ · mm.

Based on the existing literature, we provide practical advice for researchers seeking to work with WhatsApp data with respect to data collection, participant incentivization, data processing, informed consent, anonymization, and reproducibility of research. These insights might also prove useful to researchers seeking to work with other kinds of chat log data. We conclude that WhatsApp is an intriguing data source for social science research questions but that the data have to be treated with great caution to ensure ethical conduct. To facilitate this, we present several issues to contemplate for designing studies and briefly introduce the “WhatsR” package for R - our own package for parsing and visualizing data from exported WhatsApp chat logs with convenience features for tailoring, anonymizing, and extracting metadata from them. ","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Health Informatics', 'Health Psychology', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-19467-2_3,en,Ocean Acidification and Sea Warming-Toward a Better Comprehension of Its Consequences,OriginalPaper,"Climate change, rigorously heralded more than thirty years ago as a real threat, has become the most pressing and pernicious global problem for the entire planet. In conjunction with local impacts such as fishing, eutrophication or the invasion of alien species, to give just a few examples, the acidification of the oceans and the warming of the sea began to show its effects more than twenty years ago. These signals were ignored at the time by the governing bodies and by the economic stakeholders, who now see how we must run to repair the huge inflicted damage. Today, different processes are accelerating, and the thermodynamic machine has definitely deteriorated. We see, for example, that the intensity and magnitude of hurricanes and typhoons has increased. Most models announce more devastation of flash floods and a decomposition in the water cycle, which are factors directly affecting ecosystems all over the world. Important advances are also observed in the forecasting of impacts of atmospheric phenomena in coastal areas with more and more accurate models. Rising temperatures and acidification already affect many organisms, impacting the entire food chain. All organisms, pelagic or benthic, will be affected directly or indirectly by climate change at all depths and in all the latitudes. The impact will be non-homogeneous. In certain areas it will be more drastic than in others, and the visualization of such impacts is already ongoing. Some things may be very evident, such as coral mortalities in tropical areas or in the surface waters of the Mediterranean, while others may be less visible, such as changes in microelement availability affecting plankton productivity. In fact, primary productivity in microalgae, macroalgae and phanerogams is already beginning to feel the impact of warmer, stratified and nutrient-poor waters in many parts of the planet. Nutrients are becoming less available, temperature is rising above certain tolerance limits and water movement (turbulence) may change in certain areas favoring certain species of microplankton instead of others. All these mechanisms, together with light availability (which, in principle, is not drastically changing except for the cloudiness), affect the growth of the organisms that can photosynthesize and produce oxygen and organic matter for the rest of the trophic chain. That shift in productivity completely changes the rest of the food chain. In the Arctic or Antarctic, the problem is slightly different. Life depends on the dynamics of ice that is subject to seasonal changes. But winter solidification and summer dissolution is undergoing profound changes, causing organisms that are adapted to that rhythm of ice change to be under pressure. The change is more evident in the North Pole, but is also visible in the South pole, where the sea ice cover has also dramatically changed. In the chapter there is also a mention about the general problem of the water currents and their profound change do greenhouse gas effects. The warming of the waters and their influence on the marine currents are also already affecting the different ocean habitats. The slowdown of certain processes is causing an acceleration in the deoxygenation of the deepest areas and therefore an impact on the fragile communities of cold corals that populate large areas of our planet. Many organisms will be affected in their dispersion and their ability to colonize new areas or maintain a connection between different populations. The rapid adaptations to these new changes are apparent. Nature is on its course of restart from these new changes, but in this transitional phase the complexity and interactions that have taken thousands or millions of years to form can fade away until a new normal is consolidated.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"

The growing population leading to a large volume of vehicles accessing the same roadways makes it difficult for an ambulance to operate efficiently and thereby affecting a key survival factor during various emergencies known as ambulance response time (ART). It is found that road accident fatalities are on the rise due to delays in providing medical assistance due to various complexities, which is a matter of grave concern. This paper proposes to identify the main issues that exist with the current ambulance system through an interactive survey. The survey showed that it was imperative to think about providing a faster and efficient means of a system that can address the concerns. An innovative design process is studied and explained to come about finding a possible and feasible solution to improvise the ambulance response time.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Materials Engineering']"

The accuracy of the four deep learning pre-trained models is above the averages between top-1 and top-5. The accuracy of classifying and detecting the samples exceeded the top-5 accuracy for the pre-trained AlexNet model around 3% and by 0.2% for the GoogleNet model. The accurate model here is the GoogleNet model, as the accuracy is 89.08%, and it is higher than AlexNet by 1.26%. At the same time, the computed accuracy for the new created deep learning CNN model exceeded all pre-trained models by achieving 97.62% at a learning rate of 0.001 using Adam’s optimisation algorithm. The created deep learning CNN model will enable users (e.g., highways agencies) to scan a long highway and detect types of cracks accurately in a very short time compared to traditional approaches. A new deep learning CNN-based highway cracks detection was developed based on testing four pre-trained CNN models and analysing each model’s capabilities to maximise the accuracy of the proposed CNN.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Construction Management']"

A Contribution to Embodied Performance Pedagogies,OriginalPaper,"Bodily movement is at the heart of high-quality performance and deserves proper attention in instrumental education curricula. This study presents an analysis of the bodily behavior of professional and university-level saxophone players ( N  = 20) conducted with the aim of developing pedagogical cues on embodied communication and expression during music performance. Participants performed five excerpts of the classical saxophone standard repertoire while motion capture, audio, and video data were recorded. A systematic observational procedure was carried out to analyze the relationship between movement and music, including gesture codification and score annotation of each of the 100 performance recordings, and further comparison between participants was made. Five gestural trends were extracted, related to expressive communication, pitch contour influence, rhythm and pulse influence, technique facilitation strategies, and full-body behaviors. Findings suggest saxophone players use gestures and postures as a resource for expressing significant musical locations, aiding perception of musical elements, and facilitating technical challenges. These insights contribute to the development of an embodied approach to instrumental teaching and learning, promoting body awareness, communicative and facilitative skills through movement education.","['Architecture / Design', 'Industrial Design', 'Digital/New Media', 'Structural Materials', 'Music']"

Hence, intensive research to study the underlying growth kinetics of dendrites in batteries has been initiated. However, existing technologies such as scanning electron microscopy and x-ray computed tomography are prohibitively expensive for in-operando monitoring. Recently, ultrasound-based techniques have become a promising alternative method for monitoring the health and status of battery cells. However, most of the reported ultrasonic methods utilise bulk waves which propagate through a laminated structure of cathode, anode, and electrolyte. In this study we use miniature transducers to excite fundamental shear-horizontal mode (SH0*) guided ultrasonic waves that propagate along an individual cathode and anode of an aqueous zinc ion battery. Coupled with optical microscopy, the cyclical variations of wave velocity and attenuation can be associated with the zinc strip-ping/plating phenomena that occur at the electrode surface. This demonstrates the sensitivity of the SH0* mode guided wave to dendrite formation at the electrode-electrolyte interface. More importantly, the findings suggest that measurements of guided ultrasonic waves may be used to quantitatively track dendrite growth in batteries.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

First, an experimental campaign was performed for different operating conditions (velocity, amplitude, frequency). During these phases the sound images were collected with the acoustic camera. This is followed by the pre-processing phase in which the acoustic images are prepared to train the network. The next step concerns the creation of a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) suitable for the classification of sound images. The last one involves training and testing of the network created. The analysis of the training plot and the confusion matrix show promising results. Most of the analyzed images are classified correctly with an overall accuracy of the model of 95%, despite the simplicity of the network created. Observing the excellent obtained results, this technique promises to be suitable for non-intrusive monitoring, allowing companies to reduce maintenance costs. The strength of this procedure is that, although the measurements are made in a noisy environment and not in an anechoic chamber, the Convolutional Neural Network is able to classify the images very well.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

The functional dependence for construction of the complete curve of contamination of the roadside zone depending on the coordinate of distance from the track axis was obtained. The model of mass transfer of dust particles makes it possible to estimate soil contamination in the roadside zone. It was established that on the basis of correlation of theoretical surface contamination with actual contamination, it is possible to draw a complete contamination curve by sampling points using the functional dependence of mass transfer obtained in the modeling. It was revealed that 70% of dust surface pollution accounts for the right-of-way, providing further maximum contamination with heavy metals of the upper layer of soils.

This study firstly investigated the AGEs accumulation reducing potential of soluble dietary fiber (SDF) from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa fruits in antiglycation and trapping AGEs aspects. To obtain superior functionalities, the SDF was prepared by an enzymatic modified extraction method (ESDF). The result showed the extraction yield of SDF increased by 45% with the Viscozyme L modification. The structural characterizations indicated the enzymatic treatment greatly influenced the monosaccharide composition, thermal stability, crystallinity, and apparent viscosity of Rhodomyrtus tomentosa fruits SDF (RTSDF) as compared with SDF obtained from water extraction method (WSDF). The antioxidant assay indicated that RTSDF could scavenge O 2−∙ ,OH ∙ , and H 2 O 2 radicals and chelate Fe 2+ . Additionally, RTSDF, especially ESDF, reduced the more fluorescent AGEs generation in bovine serum albumin (BSA)-fructose model, and protected the BSA from oxidation and cross-linking. Besides, the RTSDF presented the ability to trap those already formed BSA-bound AGEs. ESDF exhibited higher AGEs binding capacity, while WSDF demonstrated stronger ability in restraining the AGEs diffusion. These results suggested the potential utility of RTSDF serving as an essential ingredient in functional foods to reduce AGEs accumulation in human body, controlling AGEs-associated diseases.","['Chemistry', 'Food Science', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general', 'Agriculture', 'Biotechnology']"

However, the parameter determination in designing the optimal kernel characteristics for video motion magnification is challenging, which needs to be addressed, in terms of the center frequency and bandwidth, especially when the structure is geometrically complex and the structural vibration modes are not well separated in the frequency domain. Their decomposition usually is determined by handcrafted designed kernels, such as the complex steerable pyramids, and Gabor wavelets, typically may not be optimally designed kernels for the extraction of subtle motions in a specific scenario. In this paper, optimal decomposition kernel is learned and designed directly from baseline dataset images acquired from existing videos using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) approach. Many of these responses resemble Gabor wavelet filters and Laplacian filters, which suggests that the proposed deep network learns to extract similar information as done by the complex steerable filters.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-14608-4_12,en,Scar Tissue. Visible and Invisible Traces of Boundaries and Wounds,OriginalPaper,"Hurts very often leave signs. These signs can be more or less visible. They can be both physical and psychological. We usually call them “scars”. In English, “scar formation” and “healing” are synonyms. In medicine, the formation of scars depends on the conditions of the tissue, on the whole person hurt and on environmental factors. Hurts can involve just one individual or a group of people (a family, a community, even a whole nation). So, we can find scars on single bodies (skin, bones, organs) and on buildings, public spaces, cities. Visible scars can be hidden (with shame or decency) or shown (with pride or display). Time is obviously involved as well. Scars are the visible traces that something painful happened, so they are a physical kind of memory. And we can assume that all of this is true also in the psychological process of healing, both for individuals and for communities. Scars can become a boundary, physically and metaphorically, between past and future, between me and not-me, between victim and perpetrator. The way we deal with our seams tells about ourselves as well as about the hurt that caused it and as about the environment we live in. Environment, intended both in its physical and in its relational qualities, can help and encourage the process of healing, with conscious action or just with a supportive and enduring emotional mood. But it can also slow and even hinder this process, with and impatient and hostile emotional mood.

The diagnosis of DGE is based on International Study Group for Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) clinical criteria and objective assessments of DGE are infrequently used. The present literature review aimed to identify objective measures of DGE following PD and determine whether these measures correlate with the clinical definition of DGE. Methods A systematic search was performed using the MEDLINE Ovid, EMBASE, Google Scholar and CINAHL databases for studies including pancreatic surgery, delayed gastric emptying and gastric motility until June 2022. The primary outcome was modalities undertaken for the objective measurement of DGE following PD and correlation between objective measurements and clinical diagnosis of DGE. Relevant risk of bias analysis was performed. Results The search revealed 4881 records, of which 46 studies were included in the final analysis. There were four objective modalities of DGE assessment including gastric scintigraphy ( n  = 28), acetaminophen/paracetamol absorption test ( n  = 10), fluoroscopy ( n  = 6) and the 13 C-acetate breath test ( n  = 3). Protocols were inconsistent, and reported correlations between clinical and objective measures of DGE were variable; however, amongst these measures, at least one study directly or indirectly inferred a correlation, with the greatest evidence accumulated for gastric scintigraphy. Conclusion Several objective modalities to assess DGE following PD have been identified and evaluated, however are infrequently used. Substantial variability exists in the literature regarding indications and interpretation of these tests, and there is a need for a real-time objective modality which correlates with ISGPS DGE definition after PD.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgery', 'Abdominal Surgery', 'Cardiac Surgery', 'General Surgery', 'Thoracic Surgery', 'Vascular Surgery']"

Tumor of the adrenal gland more than 4 cm in diameter or if the mass enlarges by 1 cm during observation period is recommended to be surgically removed after thorough endocrine clearance. The concept of minimally invasive surgery changed the approach to adrenal tumors but did not changed the indications and goals of treatment [1–4]. Posterior retroperitoneal adrenalectomy has the advantage of direct approach without mobilizing adjacent structures justifying the shorter operative time and lower blood loss. The only drawback of this technique is the unfamiliar anatomic view of retroperitoneal space [5].

In marine ecosystems, the growing concentration of EOCs like pesticides, personal care products, flame retardants, plasticizers, and hormones has become a major problem that affects the flora and fauna altering their feeding behavior and sexual differentiation. Due to this, the development of highly efficient detection and remediation technologies is required to assess the contamination by EOCs. Traditional detection methods and remediation technologies have some major drawbacks, like high-cost and time-intensive methodologies that are needed to overcome to assess the growing contamination of marine environments. The use of electrochemical sensors, especially electrochemical biosensors, is a promising alternative for in situ monitoring the concentration of EOCs.

Most scholars agree that Climate change will have various impacts on ecosystems and consequently on human life. The main impacts will be on the availability, temperature, and quality of water as well as the increase in the frequency of extreme hydrological events like floods, and droughts and accordingly trigger changes in all water-related areas. Thus, one of the major challenges of the 21st century will be the adaptation to these changes in river basins. Several European and UN directives and guidelines are explaining the necessity of adaptation to climate change. Moreover, the EU water framework directive (WFD) requires an integrated river basin management across administrative or political boundaries and demands to consider possible climate change impacts. This paper analyzes the effects that will cause climate change on the population and settlements of the Vjosa River Basin (VRB), one of the most important in Albania. It is not only based on the calculation and analyses of the effects on the number of populations, diseases and health problems, and settlements that are in constant danger from the floods, but also in using ArcGIS pro to visualize and analyze these effects and to propose solutions. Mapping is an important tool that helps the policymakers to identify easily the hotspots and to make the interventions where really needed. These maps can be used as a model to apply in other river basins of Albania, especially the ones potentially vulnerable to climate change.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Attitudes towards safety are important in dangerous circumstances (life risk or possibility for injuries) among construction workers, while the study of emotions in relation to safety attitudes provides new perspective for safety. The objective of the study is to test whether emotionally committed employees have more positive attitudes towards safety, while less committed have negative valence towards safety. The hypothesis was that employees with higher degree of affective commitment have more positive attitudes towards safety compared to employees with lower degree of affective commitment. The interviews were conducted with 90 construction employees (high school education) in North Macedonia. The results are in favor of the hypothesis e.g., committed employees have more positive attitudes towards safety. The explanation is that there is a tendency to match attitudes towards safety with the emotions that employees have about the organization.

Gradually, the idea took hold that these drugs were treating certain disorders instead of just sedating patients. Tranquillizers were renamed antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, hypnotics, and mood stabilizers. Side effects as “an interesting inversion of clinical manifestations” were soon noted. Agitation turned into depression, and psychotic reactions and increased anxiety occurred, as did suicidal ideation and acts. Extremely violent homicides were noted in both adults and children.

In the field of structural engineering, defects like generation and growth of cracks, yielding, failure of bonds, fibre failure etc. is a major cause of concern from the view point of serviceability and economy. Such defects emit transient elastic stress waves in solids. These waves are known as Acoustic Emission (AE) waves and the defects may be called as AE source. Analysis of the AE waves, which are recorded by AE sensors, are often done for localisation of AE source with the help of WT. Authors previously established a method to localise the damage in plates using WT. However, the localisation process is very useful for large plates. In the present study, the established method is checked for effectiveness of localising defect/AE source in small plates. Experimental tests are conducted using small rectangular plates to localise simulated AE source using WT, Lamb modes and dispersion relation of plates. The result shows, due to edge reflection of AE waves, localisation in small plates is more complex than that in large plates and more study is needed to enhance the effectiveness of the method for small plates.","['Materials Science', 'Structural Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

Previous studies examining the effects of specific miRNAs on cancer cells in vitro have involved ectopic expression of miRNA mimics in 2D in vitro culture. Assessment of cell viability and gene expression ensures that upregulation of the chosen miRNA and repression of its target genes have been achieved.

The dynamic behavior of the RBSC system is easily affected by the bearing outer race localized defect, which is difficult to identify accurately. Inappropriate dynamic analysis of system behavior will further affect monitoring and diagnosis of the system. This paper presents a mathematical model of the RBSC system with bearing outer race localized defect to study the dynamic behavior of the system. The model develops a smooth spalling path in the bearing outer race to simulate the successive passage of the balls. The model also considers the effect of centrifugal load on the bearing force. The impact of the bearing outer race localized defect on the RBSC system during the acceleration process is analyzed. The numerical results show the bearing outer race localized defect will aggravate the nonlinear behavior of the RBSC system and is prone to chaotic motion. Meanwhile, affected by the bearing outer race localized defect, the vibration of the RBSC system will increase in the speed range of relatively low and relatively high.

Using the concept of a blocked experimental design, seaMass can analyze all common discovery proteomics paradigms, including label-free (e.g., Waters Progenesis input), SILAC (e.g., MaxQuant input), isotope labelling (e.g., SCIEX ProteinPilot iTraq and Thermo ProteomeDiscoverer TMT input), and data-independent acquisition (e.g., OpenSWATH-PyProphet input), and is able to scale to study with hundreds of assays or more. By utilizing hierarchical Bayesian modelling, seaMass assesses the quantification reliability of each feature and peptide across assays so that only those in consensus influence the resulting protein group quantification strongly. Similarly, unexplained variation in each individual assay is captured, providing both a metric for quality control and automatic down-weighting of suspect assays. To achieve this, each protein group-level quantification outputted by seaMass is accompanied by the standard deviation of its posterior uncertainty. Moreover, seaMass integrates a flexible differential expression analysis subsystem with false discovery rate control based on the popular MCMCglmm package for Bayesian mixed-effects modelling, and also provides uncertainty-aware principal components analysis. We provide a description for using seaMass to perform an end-to-end analysis using a real dataset associated with a published clinical proteomics study.","['Life Sciences', 'Biostatistics', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general', 'Bioinformatics']"

Sequential rule mining is a pattern mining technique that retrieves rules in order. It has number of applications in different area including healthcare. Healthcare is the prime concern for human’s life. Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), which is also known as type-1 diabetes is a kind of chronic disease and patients of these disease needs to get insulin as a supplement or medicine. Technologies that predict the right amount of insulin dose for a patient is needed for correct prognosis of patients. It facilitates to better health in patients to maintain the glucose level in a specific range which produces the right energy for human cells. Our objective is to find insulin therapy plan for diabetes patients. In this work, we applied some sequential mining algorithms to predict the dosage values of regular, NPH and ultraLente insulin at three different time frames, i.e., at prebreakfast, prelunch, and presupper. Sequential rules are generated to predict the dosage ranges for different time frames with support and confidence metrics. These rules are used to recommend particular type of insulin with dosage amounts. This work also compares different sequential rule mining algorithms such as ERMiner, CMRules, CMDeo, and RuleGrowth with their memory taken and execution speeds. We concluded that by making sequences of blood glucose ranges with insulin dose ranges we can generate rules for insulin prediction as well as diabetes predictions. We can also conclude that after applying different sequential rule mining algorithms, ERMiner is faster among the algorithms but it takes more memory to execute.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

Indigenous wellness tourism is a relatively new notion for tourism stakeholders, and it has not yet been prioritized to promote local tourism potential. As the demand of recipients of services offered by the indigenous-inspired spa is not a unified whole, spa owners must proportionate the value of their service and products in order to make the indigenous-inspired spa more competitive in the world wellness-related market. To deliver the most outstanding and unique solution by presenting indigenous-inspired spa products and services, the spa owner must address customer expectations to eliminate their necessity as a wanted product and service that might potentially support numerous value propositions for the clients. As a response, this study aims to look into the activities of the indigenous-inspired spa to portray value to its clients. The methodology that will be used is on-site observation and in-depth interviews with Indigenous-inspired spa-goers and indigenous-inspired spa employers of the two selected case studies.

Such information is often recorded only within the huge amounts of unstructured textual documentation that are typically generated for large-scale construction projects. Accordingly, the process of locating, understanding, analysing and combining sufficient intelligence from documentation about previous projects can be overwhelming. Previously, text mining (TM) technology has been used to develop a semantically-enhanced search system over a repository of workplace accident reports, to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of locating important information relating to construction safety. In this article, we describe our enhancement of this system, through the generation and integration of a knowledge graph (KG). We extract triples consisting of subject, predicate and object (SPO) from unstructured text and map them to concepts in a knowledge base (KB). The mapping is carried out by comparing the contextualised representations of the text surrounding the SPO elements with concept descriptions in the KB. Subsequently, a Coreference Resolution method is used to detect mentions in text that refer to the same pronominal references that occur in SPO triples, to ensure that relevant knowledge is not overlooked. Finally, SPO triples are filtered to retain only those containing knowledge that is relevant to construction safety. We show that our approach can significantly outperform related methods, both in terms of detecting the elements of triples and linking them to entries in a KB.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It contains an end-colostomy and closure of a rectal stump. It was first described by Henri Albert Hartmann (1860–1952) for resection of rectal or sigmoid cancer [1]. Nowadays, Hartmann procedure is usually used in treating malignant obstruction of left-sided colon or in emergent conditions, such as sigmoid colon perforation [2], mostly because of diverticulum disease. The advantage of Hartmann’s procedure is reduction in morbidity and mortality in emergent settings because it avoids the possibility of complications from a colorectal anastomosis. For patients with unstable hemodynamic status, or multiple comorbidity or inflammatory condition of the intestinal tissue, which would make performing a colorectal anastomosis difficult or have a higher risk of anastomotic leakage, this procedure is simple and fast, and meanwhile preserve the chance of restoration of intestine continuity after patients’ general condition got improvement. However, the Hartmann reversal rate is variable in different studies, ranging from 0 to 50% [3, 4]. The morbidity rate of Hartmann reversal is up to 55%, and the mortality rate is ranging from 0 to 14% [5–7]. A study showed reversal of Hartmann between 3 and 9 months associated with increased risk of postoperative complications [8]. The mean interval from Hartmann procedure to its reversal is ranging from 7.5 to 9.1 months [3, 5]. We usually delay the reversal of Hartmann’s operation at least 6 months later in our daily practice. Hartmann’s procedure and/or reversal of Hartmann’s procedure could be conventional or laparoscopic. Laparoscopic reversal of Hartmann’s procedure is associated with less complications compared to the conventional method, especially in wound infection, anastomotic leakage, and cardiopulmonary complications [3].","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Minimally Invasive Surgery', 'Colorectal Surgery', 'Imaging / Radiology', 'Surgery']"

All existing studies of metamaterials assume that the structure is intact and undamaged. However, all real-world structures will eventually experience some damage (e.g., due to manufacturing defects, material inclusions, handling damage, corrosion, etc.). For metamaterials to be placed in service in real applications, an understanding of their behavior in the presence of damage is necessary. This chapter explores two related concepts: structural health monitoring (i.e., damage detection) and damage tolerance (i.e., robust performance in the presence of failures). Central to both concepts is the fact that metamaterial damage creates highly localized modes near the damaged location, which may cause undesirable high local stresses. Damage can be detected by observing the presence of these modes, and damage tolerance can be improved by designing the metamaterial in such a way as to tailor these local modes to mitigate the stress increases.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Solid Construction', 'Complexity', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Structural Materials']"

In developed countries, women with an abnormal smear are referred for colposcopy, which involves examining the cervix using a low-magnification microscope (the colposcope) to guide biopsy and detect precancerous lesions. However, due to the poor detection performance of colposcopy, multiple visits and biopsies are required, which delays patient management and makes this screening approach expensive and not applicable in low-resource countries. Therefore, a new, more effective, and affordable imaging technique is needed for improving the performance of colposcopy to reduce the cost and time of diagnosis and patient management in developed countries significantly, as well as to design and build a low-cost system that could be part of an economically viable “screen and treat” approach in low-resource countries. Imaging Mueller polarimetry has shown great promise in this regard. This optical modality allows the effective detection of precancerous cervical lesions. Furthermore, it can be implemented with a macroscopic field of view, which is essential for clinical applications, using low-cost optics and patient-friendly light sources. In this chapter, we summarize and discuss the milestones we have achieved in demonstrating the ability of imaging Mueller polarimetry to improve cervical cancer diagnosis, from preliminary ex vivo tests to the first in vivo feasibility study. The results obtained so far pave the way for a clinical trial (currently in preparation) that will evaluate the performance of Mueller polarimetric imaging for cervical cancer screening on a cohort of patients under real-life conditions of blood perfusion and mechanical stress.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Biomedical Engineering/Biotechnology', 'Medical and Radiation Physics', 'Diagnostic Radiology']"

As more (expensive) AI projects continue to be proposed, due to both internal and external pressures, business leaders are faced with the need to measure the return on investment (ROI) of such projects or to conduct valuation of such projects rigorously. In part, the problem arises because AI can be challenging to implement properly, and like many emerging technologies, the benefits may not be felt immediately or directly. In this chapter, we discuss the challenges of implementing practical AI systems, many of which stem from data acquisition and quality issues, followed by a deep dive into guidelines and principles for measuring ROI of, and objectively valuing, AI projects.","['Business and Management', 'IT in Business', 'Industries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Business Strategy/Leadership']"

Indian cities rank among the most polluted cities in the world, and Delhi tops the list. The effects of air pollution on agriculture, the economy, traffic accidents, and human health are numerous. The coronavirus pandemic brought with itself a nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus. Nationwide lockdown in India started on 25th March 2020 which brought everything to a standstill—vehicular as well as industrial activities. As a result, major Indian cities saw a significant and sudden improvement in air quality. This research work focuses on analyzing the impact of nationwide lockdown on air quality in major Indian cities—Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Chennai. This research aims to understand and make sense of the sudden improvement in air quality during the nationwide lockdown by using data visualization techniques. We have analyzed the levels of individual air contaminant species for a period of 2016–2020 (till 22nd May) focusing mainly on the months in which lockdown happened and comparing them with corresponding data from the previous years. Our analyses show that air pollution in major Indian cities is mostly anthropogenic and that when such activities came to a halt, air quality improved. COVID-19 had a substantial impact on air quality during the nationwide lockdown; however, as our analyses clearly demonstrated the cause of these improvements to be a full shutdown of the economy, such improvements are not sustainable in the long run, and pollution levels will once again rise to pre-COVID levels after these restrictions are lifted. It is imperative to adopt an airshed approach to tackle air pollution in cities like Delhi where surrounding regions also contribute to the city’s pollution.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Machine Learning']"

Air quality prediction is an indispensable part of smart cities as it is conducive to guiding the development of air pollution prevention and control and alleviating urban air pollution. Based on the PM2.5 concentration data of 10 state-controlled air quality monitoring sites in Changsha City, Hunan Province, China from January 1, 2017 to December 30, 2021 and the meteorological data of Changsha city, a long short- term memory recurrent neural network model applicable to PM2.5 concentration prediction of Changsha city is formulated according to actual conditions with reference to related machine learning methods, and is used to predict the daily average concentration of PM2.5 at 10 air quality monitoring sites. Using the predicted PM2.5 concentration at the air quality monitoring sites in Changsha city, the spatial distribution simulation map of PM2.5 mass concentration within Changsha Third Ring Road is made by ordinary kriging method. Suggestions for PM2.5 pollution protection measures are put forward based on the predicted results. In addition, the interpolation analysis map of PM2.5 concentration distribution based on the measured value of each monitoring station is made. This is used to compare with the interpolation analysis map based on the predicted values so as to illustrate the rationality of the PM2.5 concentration prediction method.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Public Policy', 'Arts']"

It has revolutionized industries such as manufacturing, aerospace, medicine and now commonly construction. This technology has been successfully implemented in the construction industries of countries such as China, United Arab Emirates and Russia. It has improved productivity on site, produced sustainable buildings and lowered costs of production. However, there is limited use of the 3D construction methodology in South Africa. Therefore, this research examines whether there are barriers to implementing 3D printing technology within the South African construction industry. The research employs a qualitative research approach that involves interviews of 12 construction industry professionals in South Africa. The data obtained from interviews and secondary data sources were analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings revealed that critical barriers to the implementation of 3D printing within the construction industry were Regulations, the dominant labour-intensive production process and the traditional methods of procurement used in construction project delivery in South Africa. Based on these findings, the study concluded that 3D printing technology would make the project production process more efficient and effective from a cost, performance, and quality perspective; however, the South African construction industry is currently not conducive to the implementation of an innovative solution in construction such as 3D printing. Further research should be conducted on how 3D printing could be implemented in the current state of the construction industry.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Sustainable Development', 'Construction Management']"

The first node examined was originally developed to measure two vital parameters of human body; i.e. body temperature and heartbeats. The second node incorporated sensors to detect a blood oxygen level to the architecture of the first node, while the third node enhanced the former architecture by adding a body acceleration sensor. The three proposed nodes are powered by different energy harvesting systems. The harvesting of the energy started by using only a photovoltaic cell to power the first and second nodes, then a thermoelectric generator is added with the photovoltaic cell to power the third node. In the harvesting operations, the utilized energy storages varied between Li-ion rechargeable batteries and super-capacitors. The super-capacitors found to have a lower energy density than the batteries. In the three nodes, the vital data transmission is varied, via a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and a Wi-Fi. Whilst BLE is preferred for a personal use, the Wi-Fi is needed in hospitals. The conducted review reveals that although, the first node has the longest lifetime i.e. capacity of energy storage compared with the other two nodes, the third node is found more sustainable in terms of energy harvester type. Finally, considering the performance of the three nodes, a tradeoff between the power consumption and the complexity of each proposed architecture is emphasized.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Tie deflection profiles can be used for flagging defective conditions of rail tracks such as center-binding, that can cause train derailments. The technique utilizes an array of air-coupled capacitive ultrasonic transducers oriented parallel to the tie with a minimum clearance of 3-in. from the rail to ensure contactless inspection. The proposed technique has the potential for detecting both the static and dynamic behavior of ties. The transducers are used in pulse-echo mode and the distance between the transducer to the tie surface is computed by tracking the time-of-flight of the reflected wave from the tie surface. An adaptive, reference-based, cross-correlation operation is used for measuring relative tie deflections. Multiple measurements along the width of the tie allow the measurement of twisting deformations as well. An acoustic signal strength-based and an image-based classifier are used in tandem to differentiate signals coming from ties and ballast. Data acquisition and processing are performed using a LabVIEW real-time module. Field tests on a replica test track, at walking speeds, were performed at the Rail Defect Testing Facility. The initial results indicate the potential of this system to measure full-field tie deflections in 3D at walking speeds (~3 mph).","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Patients with cirrhosis and some patients with chronic HBV (hepatitis B virus) or HCV (hepatitis C virus) infection are at sufficiently high risk for developing HCC, so surveillance programs have been in place since 1980. Imaging surveillance of at-risk patients results in detection of HCC at an earlier stage, with a favorable effect on survival, when combined with surgical resection and ablation procedures. Specific screening guidelines, established by scientific hepatology societies and substantially unchanged over the last two decades, recommend ultrasound screening of cirrhotic patients every 6 months and measurement of alpha-fetoprotein blood levels. However, controversy remains on the best screening protocols and whether surveillance truly leads to a reduction in mortality in particular groups, such as patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), virally suppressed chronic HBV infection, cured HCV infection, or advanced fibrosis. New serum maker candidates and new imaging techniques like contrast-enhanced ultrasound and non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging are currently in evaluation as surveillance tests. In real-life settings, surveillance is highly underused (24%) in at-risk patients, even in high-income countries. Factors associated with screening process failures are racial and socioeconomic disparities, and NASH cirrhosis.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgery', 'Gastroenterology', 'General Practice / Family Medicine']"

Disturbance in the balance of gut microbiome “gut dysbiosis” has led to the emergence of the concept of “leaky gut” and metabolic endotoxemia. Previous studies observed higher lipopolysaccharide or lipopolysaccharide binding protein concentrations in diabetics than in healthy controls. Translocation of bacteria and their products through the disrupted gut barrier increased the circulation of markers that could be linked to increased intestinal permeability. The end result of translocated products is the stimulation of systemic inflammatory response affecting many organs and increasing insulin resistance thus aggravating diabetes.

SSA reconstructs the original time series using principal components from the signal subspace—thereby eliminating noise components altogether—and yields a filtered signal that finds its use in modal identification. Using time-domain decomposition and least-squares technique, the modal response generated using SSA is fit with a free-decay signal from which the estimates of natural frequencies and damping ratios are carried out. The paper attempts to investigate a simple model of a dynamical system and analyzes it using the proposed approach to provide a comparison with traditional operational modal analysis techniques. The results demonstrate that SSA can be used as a powerful tool for the analysis of vibratory behavior for structures exhibiting well-separated spectral components. Inherent filtering embedded within its framework and its seamless integration into a modal identification framework hold strong promise for application inbuilt infrastructure systems.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Building Materials']"

All these misconceptions and propaganda have been spreading through word of mouth (verbal) discussion among citizens. In this study, a hybrid machine learning approach was proposed with the help of natural language processing to build a sentiment classification and prediction system using the data collected from the public regarding their opinions on the COVID-19 vaccination program.

As a result, following South Africa’s admission to the African Peer Review Mechanism in 2003, the realm of local government is important to the achievement of the country’s Programme of Action. The White Paper on Local Government (WPLG), which serves as the Chapter’s starting point, provides a policy framework for local government in South Africa that is congruent with the APRM’s theme areas of democracy, political governance, and socio-economic development. Local government in South Africa, however, is not a homogeneous institution, and there are differences in their capacity to provide for their citizens. The WPLG provides a policy framework for both rural and urban towns, but the two environments are significantly different, providing substantial issues for rural communities.

So we use the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) as the support to improve the applicability of the FDD method for traffic induced vibration. In the numerical simulation, the modal-parameters were estimated by acting traffic loads to a finite element plate model using shell elements. As expected, the mode shapes and natural frequencies estimated by the FDD method only were not accurate. However, we were able to improve the accuracy by comparing those results with the estimation results of the SVD method. In the field experiment, a vehicle and a bridge with known specifications were used to conduct multipoint bridge vibration measurements at 10 points using MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) sensors. The results of the field experiment showed a similar trend to the numerical experiments, we could most likely estimate the natural frequencies of the bridge.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

This meta-analysis aims to explore the impact of multimodal prehabilitation on surgical and functional outcomes of abdominal surgery. Methods Medline, Embase and CENTRAL were searched for articles about multimodal prehabilitation in major abdominal surgery. Primary outcomes were postoperative complications with a Clavien–Dindo score ≥3, and functional outcomes, measured by the 6-Minute Walking Test (6MWT). Secondary outcome measures included the quality-of-life measures. Pooled risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated, with DerSimonian and Laird random effects used to account for heterogeneity. Results Twenty-five studies were included, analysing 4,210 patients across 13 trials and 12 observational studies. Patients undergoing prehabilitation had significantly fewer overall complications (RR = 0.879, 95% CI 0.781–0.989, p  = 0.034). There were no significant differences in the rates of wound infection, anastomotic leak and duration of hospitalization. The 6MWT improved preoperatively in patients undergoing prehabilitation (SMD = 33.174, 95% CI 12.674–53.673, p  = 0.005), but there were no significant differences in the 6MWT at 4 weeks (SMD = 30.342, 95% CI − 2.707–63.391, p  = 0.066) and 8 weeks (SMD = 24.563, 95% CI − 6.77–55.900, p  = 0.104) postoperatively. Conclusions As preoperative patient optimization shifts towards an interdisciplinary approach, evidence from this meta-analysis shows that multimodal prehabilitation improves the preoperative functional capacity and reduces postoperative complication rates, suggesting its potential in effectively optimizing the abdominal surgery patient. However, there is a large degree of heterogenicity between the prehabilitation interventions between included articles; hence results should be interpreted with caution.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgery', 'Abdominal Surgery', 'Cardiac Surgery', 'General Surgery', 'Thoracic Surgery', 'Vascular Surgery']"

Western culture has significantly challenged Chinese traditional culture and social norms, which have been dominated by men. Influenced by Western feminism, Chinese feminists fought to emancipate women and greatly improved Chinese women’s social status during the twentieth century. However, in the twenty-first century, witnessing the problems of previous feminist movements, which any human endeavors could not avoid, the globalized patriarchal world does not wait for feminists to find a solution but have a strong backlash against feminism. In China, misaligned with the rapid economic development, Chinese women’s rights have significantly rolled back to serve men’s interests in the twenty-first century. The double portion of the cultural constraints from both traditional Chinese and modern Western cultures provide Chinese women with both greater challenges and greater opportunities. On one hand, a Chinese woman should not make herself a bigger foot-binding cloth in her mind by internalizing the intersectionality of globalized patriarchal cultures; on the other hand, she should not follow the misleading information from the mass media to be manipulated as woman tools to make great leaps to serve patriarchal and capitalist interests. Surviving and succeeding in the double portion of the cultural constraints of a globalized world, Chinese women leaders have developed a double portion of wisdom from both traditional Chinese and modern Western cultures. If Western women leaders are like iron ladies with assertiveness, Chinese women leaders are more like water ladies with gentleness, flexibility, and fortitude. The hard iron could be broken by harder cultural constraints. Dripping water hollows out stone ( di shui chuan shi ) through persistence instead of force. This chapter utilizes a transdisciplinary approach to examine both the cultural constraints and opportunities for Chinese women from both traditional and modern cultures through historical and global lenses. Implications for Chinese women and Chinese policy-makers are provided at the end of the chapter.","['Business and Management', 'Asian Business', 'Human Resource Development', 'Business Strategy/Leadership', ""Women's Studies""]"

The tremendous development of networked devices had increased its reach over the primitive network topologies. This significant change has launched the revolution after flat-page. The surge in the global urban population is placing new demands on people's daily lives in terms of pollution, public safety, road congestion, etc. To accommodate this rapid growth, new technologies are being developed and smarter cities are being built. Incorporating the Internet of Things (IoT) into everyday life makes it possible to develop new smart solutions such as services and applications for industries like hospitals, surveillance, forestry, etc. Research on Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning (DL), and help of Data Visualization have shown how IoT performance can be improved with some technological aids. This creates a rapid demand for addition and works in terms of Big Data with first-class technologies that we have around us, so in this paper, we will talk about such things and show a comparison on this basis with the other works that are under it, with the deep learning and artificial intelligence models. This study will help us to show how it overall contributes to the growth of the Internet of Things in society to provide a better life for future generations. Finally, we will outline the existing obstacles and problems that occur during the smart city growth facilities.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security']"

Much less research, however, has explored how officer appearance can impact officers’ perceptions of themselves, including with respect to safety. Drawing upon survey data from a sample of sworn police officers ( N  = 238) from the Queensland Police Service, we empirically investigate the effects of different uniforms and accoutrements on officers’ perceptions of their own safety, comfort, and power. Our results reveal that officers’ perceptions vary as a function of equipment (e.g., shirt color, vest style, headwear). Our results also reveal that officers’ perceptions of safety correlate with the other perceptual outcomes tested as part of our research.

Despite the growing awareness of sustainability issues in textile industry, daily increase in population growth results in the increase in consumption of textile products. Sustainable textile industry is inevitable in order to address the three dimensions of sustainability (economy, environment and society). Studies in textile industry revealed that less attention Attention was given to social sustainability aspects, despite considerable evidence of increase in social sustainability issues on a daily basis in this industry. Ignoring social sustainability can have a serious adverse effect on textile industry, which mitigates its competitive advantages. This study investigated the social sustainability criteria of textile industry, which were selected from the literature. Three experts were invited to rate the importance of the criteria (occupational health and safety, wages, training and education, non-discrimination, communication with employees, working hours, working condition and philanthropy). Since the experts’ opinions could be subjective, ambiguous and intangible, the Fuzzy Best–Worst Method (FBWM) was applied. The experts were asked to provide the linguistic Linguistic ratings of these criteria based on a set of membership functions. The fuzzy weights were transformed into crisp weights by using the Graded Mean Integration Representation (GMIR). The average weights obtained from all the experts were used to rank the criteria. The results revealed that working condition is the most important criterion while communication with employees is the least important one. The results would help practitioners and managers to prioritize their attention Attention for improving social sustainability in textile industry.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This requires that governments create national and goals that mirror global ambitions and put in place the necessary institutional mechanisms and monitoring systems to translate these goals into effective implementation. Achieving the SDGs requires addressing the questions related to relevant complementarities and trade-offs to the wider policy domains. This in turn requires having in place policy frameworks that foster horizontal integration given that the SDGs and climate action cannot be achieved by sectoral siloed policies. This multisectoral, comprehensive view of sustainability policies needs to be complemented with a whole-of-government approach that engages local and regional governments (LRGs) to ensure last-mile delivery as well as attracts the private sector to the scene. The implementation of policies needs to be backed by strong high-quality disaggregated data that is capable of informing the decision-making process and strengthens delivery within a data governance framework that promotes trust in data transactions. The cross-cutting theme is that realizing the ambitions of the 2030 Agenda hinges on adequate finance, a factor that has been further stressed by the pandemic. Fiscal policies and public financial management are essential for both aligning the public financial system with the SDGs and unlocking the necessary SDG funds from non-state actors, specifically the private sector. The tripartite of policy framework and effective implementation institutions, dependable data, and adequate finance has been repeatedly stressed in the lessons learnt from the pandemic and other global crises. These are key factors toward investing in infrastructure, resilience, and human capital.","['Business and Management', 'Corporate Environmental Management', 'Governance and Government', 'Sustainable Development']"

These intricate and complex behaviors are mediated by an amalgamation of neural circuit mechanisms working in concert. Impairments in prosocial behaviors, which occur in a large number of neuropsychiatric disorders, result from disruption of the coordinated activity of these neural circuits. In this review, we focus our discussion on recent findings that utilize modern approaches in rodents to map, monitor, and manipulate neural circuits implicated in a variety of prosocial behaviors. We highlight how modulation by oxytocin, serotonin, and dopamine of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in specific brain regions is critical for regulation of adaptive prosocial interactions. We then describe how recent findings have helped elucidate pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the social deficits that accompany neuropsychiatric disorders. We conclude by discussing approaches for the development of more efficacious and targeted therapeutic interventions to ameliorate aberrant prosocial behaviors.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Psychiatry', 'Neurosciences', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Biological Psychology']"

Hyperuricemic conditions are implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Elevated uric acid level causes oxidative stress, leads to the activation of inflammatory processes, inhibits insulin pathway, and increases hepatic glucose production and dysfunction and death of pancreatic beta cells. Serum uric acid levels are found to be high in the early stages of impaired glucose metabolism. The role of uric acid in the development of abnormal glucose metabolism by causing insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion, and beta-cell dysfunction suggests it could be an early indicator of diabetes risk. Uric acid is involved in inducing oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction and also worsens insulin resistance. All these factors are involved in the development of diabetic complications as well. In this chapter, we discuss serum uric acid as a biomarker in diabetes, its complications, and its relationship with HbA1c and eGFR.","['Biomedicine', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Pharmacology/Toxicology']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-030-67930-9_11-2,en,Human Strivings and Social Change: Scenarios for Renewal in Lifelong Learning,ReviewPaper,"Competing visions for lifelong learning co-exist. The fact that one “official” discourse may be dominant does not mean that other ways of thinking about learning throughout the life course have disappeared. They are alive and well in a range of traditions and perspectives that retain their power to engage and persuade. Even when, for example, market logic seems unchallengeable, there is an enduring “undertow” of human strivings and responses to unfairness. This chapter moves on from the triadic conception of lifelong learning to focus on the significance of interconnections between its dimensions, without which the triad collapses. The social and societal aspects of human strivings that have consistently been underplayed in the discourses about skill, and even citizens’ participation, need to be taken more fully into account in scenarios for change. Lifelong learning increasingly relies on digital world solutions to support learning participation through the life course. At the same time, profound social and economic inequalities, the cumulative effects of insufficient investment in public services, and the fragilities of ecosystems have been laid bare in the global pandemic. The chapter argues that reaching for lifelong learning “solutions” means an end to reliance on the idea that systemic gaps can be filled by the agency of individuals availing themselves of (digitally enabled) opportunities. There is potential, in social ecological approaches, for human strivings and the exercise of responsibility reflexively to reshape understandings of how lifelong learning can be developed as, and for, the public good.","['Education', 'Education, general']"

doi:10.1007/698_2022_853,en,Fate of Neonicotinoids in the Environment: Why Bees Are Threatened,OriginalPaper,"Pollinators are vital for ecosystems, agriculture and the economy. Their population has been declining over several decades and the current situation is serious and of great concern. Multiple stressors are likely to have contributed to this, and exposure to neonicotinoid pesticides is one possible causative factor. Pollinators, including bees, can encounter neonicotinoids when foraging contaminated flowers, and although they were not the target organism for such pesticides, neonicotinoids can be fatal for them (lethal dose that will reduce the insect population by 50% is ~2 mg/kg). The specific application of these pesticides plays an important role in their dispersion into the environment and application to the seed coating itself provides a more targeted way to release the pesticide with a reduced risk. Neonicotinoids can disperse via aerosols (when sprayed), bound to soil dust and dust abrasion from the seed coating, via the degradation of contaminated plants or run-off from crops treated with the pesticide. They have high solubility in water (e.g. 39.8 g dinotefuran/L, 4.1 g thiamethoxam/L) and this favours their spread, however natural factors such as sunlight, warm weather and microorganisms can degrade them and reduce their persistence. The time required for the concentration of neonicotinoids in soil to reach half of their initial concentration is varied (e.g. 3.4–7,000 days). Soils that are poor in organic matter will poorly retain neonicotinoids and as a result they will be very mobile in them and potentially pollute water systems. In contrast, soils rich in organic matter will have greater retention of neonicotinoids and once saturated, neonicotinoids will leach in a sustained manner. The benefits given by neonicotinoids explain why they are widely used across the globe. Their potential impact in the fields on bees and pollinators in general thus calls for a globally responsible and restricted use of neonicotinoids as well as innovation to reduce their ecotoxicity.","['Environment', 'Environmental Chemistry', 'Waste Management/Waste Technology', 'Agriculture', 'Pollution, general', 'Applied Microbiology']"

From the earliest of times, in all cultures and traditions, the search for meaning and knowledge has been accompanied by a passing on through generations of ways that meaning can be made and connections drawn or discarded. The oral histories steeped in ancient ancestry of Indigenous peoples, and the written tomes that have influenced many a religious, spiritual, and belief system, all have their place in establishing a moral philosophy and body of ethical theory that provides rich fodder for those who seek explanations and answers to the compelling questions of life. This chapter focuses on tracing the history, defining and understanding the central tenets of what has become known as an Ethic of Care. This relational ethical theory had its roots in feminist thinking in the mid-twentieth century providing a critical understanding of the importance of interdependence and relationship while maintaining focus on the situational, structural, and political factors of importance to the individual. While ethics of justice highlight obligations, rights, and fairness, an Ethic of Care focuses on reciprocity, relationships, connections, and context. This chapter positions an Ethic of Care as a central ethical theory for social work practice and provides examples of how questions about what a compassionate response requires can shift what ought to be done from a focus on rational-objective to the relational-emotional dimension. In doing so, social workers have a foundation for decision-making that holds them on firm footing when exploring moral obligations, deservedness, and the expectations about how social relations play out on all levels. A critical Ethic of Care will also be explored as a more recent development of this perspective that provides further application to the socio-political context of human relationships. The chapter concludes with two case studies of how an Ethic of Care approach can be applied in social work-related contexts, drawing on recent research and global events.","['Education', 'Education, general', 'Social Work', 'Social Work and Community Development', 'Ethics']"

Methods A prospective cohort was conducted on a total of 4028 participants (1404 MHSO and 2624 MUSO) who underwent bariatric surgery; MHSO was defined as having abnormalities in none or one of these four parameters: systolic blood pressure and/or diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose, and high-density lipoprotein. Otherwise, the definition of MUSO was met. Body composition analysis was performed at the baseline and 6-, 12-, 24-, and 36-month post-surgery using bioelectrical impedance analyzer. Results Both phenotypes showed a significant decrease in fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) and a significant increase in EWL% and TWL% ( P trend < 0.05). FFM, FM%, and excess weight loss (EWL%) were significantly different between the two phenotypes ( P between < 0.05) during the follow-up.

With the help of experimental dynamic mechanical analysis results, the storage moduli for this particular woven CFRP are determined throughout the curing cycle and implemented into COMSOL Multiphysics finite element software to simulate the same mechanical property changes of the composite during the curing cycle, while Lamb waves are excited and sensed via piezoelectric transducers embedded within a thin PTFE film. The same is repeated to test a shortened curing cycle trimmed by one hour compared to the original cycle suggested by the manufacturer. Sensed signals are compared to experimental data for both cycles. Then, cure parameters such as minimum viscosity, gelation, and vitrification are deduced from the analysis of voltage and velocity curves of the first received A 0 mode packets. These curing parameters are shown offset by the same time deducted from the cycle, thus proving the effectiveness of this computational model.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

The liability associated with providing consumers with an adulterated or substandard product cannot only tarnish a company’s name and reputation but also impose substantial financial repercussions on the company and those individuals who play an active role in the violation. In order for a company to fully comply with the relevant food laws (both federal and state), an intimate knowledge of food science is required. Individuals knowledgeable in food science play an integral role not only in implementing and counseling food companies/processors to ensure compliance with government regulations, but these individuals are also necessary to the state and federal governments that make and enforce the relevant laws and regulators. For these reasons and more, to be further explained below, government regulation of food protection and processing presents many diverse career options for a food scientist.","['Chemistry', 'Food Science', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general']"

After briefly reviewing the history of awareness of climate change and the historical movements that have emerged and raised attention to the necessity of climate action (e.g., Club of Rome), the chapter follows with a more recent overview of the various societal dynamics that underpin the inertia towards climate action. Climate inertia can be understood as another form of absurdity whereby the current status quo is normalized (e.g., that governments and companies are doing enough to address climate change; that climate action should not interfere with economic rationale). By discussing climate inertia as hypernormalized absurdity, new insights are generated into the perpetuation of the status quo. Moreover, new ways out of the hypernormalized situation can be constructed through the process of problematization, resistance, imagining, and transformation.","['Business and Management', 'Management', 'Organization']"

Artificial intelligence, which shall make decisions autonomously or act autonomously in interaction with humans, is associated with a substantial potential for conflict that will also and especially become evident from a legal point of view. The more AI diffuses into people’s spheres of life, the more conflicts which are associated with it will become a major theme for both the legislator and the judiciary. Questions which they have to answer include who is liable in the case of an accident and how personal data recorded via robots might be used against the owner and for third parties, including government agencies. If robots carry out actions seemingly based on their own decisions the question arises whether robots are legal persons and acquire “personality” rights as a result. Building on the results from the Delphi expertise on the social conflict scenario, the chapter examines from a legal perspective the challenges that the diffusion of AI and robots brings with it in people’s spheres of life.","['Social Sciences', 'Sociology, general', 'Nursing Ethics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Social Policy', 'Politics of the Welfare State', 'Social Work and Community Development']"

The intervertebral disc acts as a shock absorber and ensures the spine’s great capacity to support high loads and different states of stress, thanks to its viscoelastic properties. Some studies have attempted to describe the viscoelastic behaviour of the intervertebral disc using classical rheological models, such as the Kelvin-Voigt, or multi-parameter models. Even if these models partially describe the viscoelastic response of disc, all viscoelastic characteristics are not fully captured. This article aims to present the current studies on the biomechanics of intervertebral disc and to introduce a new approach using the powerful mathematical tool of fractional calculus. With fractional rheological models, it could be possible to formulate a fractional law that can fully describe the viscoelastic behaviour of the intervertebral disc. This new approach could lead to a breakthrough in the study of herniated pathologies by understanding how the intervertebral disc is damaged and identifying strategies to deal with these pathological problems.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The two most prevalent types of skin cancer include melanoma and non-melanoma. Melanoma has been identified as the utmost dangerous skin cancer. Yet, discriminating melanoma lesions from non-melanoma lesions has proven challenging. Several artificial intelligence-based strategies have been introduced in the literature to handle skin cancer detection, including deep learning and few-shot learning strategies. According to the evidence in the literature, deep learning algorithms are reported to perform well when trained on large datasets. However, they are only effective when the target domain has enough labeled samples; they do not ensure adequate network activation variables to adjust to new target regions rapidly when the target domain has insufficient data. Consequently, few-shot learning paradigms have been presented in the literature to promote learning from such limited amounts of labeled data. A search on PubMed from inception to 7 June 2022 for studies investigating the review of the application of deep learning and few-shot learning in the detection of skin cancer was performed via the use of title terms “Deep Learning” AND “Few-Shot Learning” AND “Skin Cancer Detection” AND “Review,” combined with title terms or MeSH terms “Deep Learning” AND “Few-Shot Learning” AND “Skin Cancer Detection” AND “Review,” with no limits on language or date of publication. We found no paper that has reviewed the application of deep learning and few-shot learning in detecting skin cancer. This paper, therefore, presents a brief overview of some of the most critical applications of deep learning and few-shot learning schemes in the detection of skin cancer lesions from skin image data.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This study evaluates GAM models for sepsis prediction in terms of interpretability and predictive performance. Several variations of GAM models are included and offer a considerable improvement in predictive performance compared to logistic regression, while remaining interpretable. However, none of the GAM models achieved a predictive performance similar to that of a random forests classifier, which is highly effective but may not be sufficiently interpretable for end users.

The method used in this research is descriptive qualitative using online news media as data processed through NVivo 12 Plus software. This approach was chosen to see the extent to which the Ministry of Social Affairs was distributing social assistance to people affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with indicators of resources, bureaucratic structure, communication, and commitment as comparison material. Based on the data analysis that has been carried out, the bureaucratic structure is a major problem that causes delays in the distribution of social assistance with a percentage of 81.25%, not without reasons for lack of accountability and the occurrence of abuse of office by bureaucrats who control the distribution of social assistance and use the situation to commit acts of corruption. Furthermore, Resources became the second factor that caused the distribution of social assistance not to go well with a presentation of around 37.50%. Furthermore, the results of data analysis with the commitment indicator, which is not much different from the bureaucratic structure, become the third reason for the problems in the distribution of social assistance due to factors from the stakeholders in the distribution of social service who lack a strong commitment with a value presentation of around 21.25% as the primary basis in implementing responsibility. In contrast to the results of data analysis from the communication indicator, 18.75% is the lowest problem in the distribution of social assistance by the Ministry of Social Affairs to the results of data analysis from the communication indicator of 18.75%.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

New postoperative functional deficits during tumor resections might be caused by different patterns of injury. During surgery involving the insula, deficits are frequently caused by ischemic insult rather than mechanical injuries of the fiber tracts. During surgery in the paracentral region and close to the posterior limb of the internal capsule, direct mechanical injury to the motor cortex (M1) and the corticospinal tract (CST) may be of major concern. Therefore, motor preservation requires both mapping of the M1 and the CST (cortical stimulation, somatosensory-evoked potential [SSEP] phase reversal, subcortical mapping techniques) and continuous monitoring by motor-evoked potential (MEP) recordings. Both techniques can be performed with the patient under general total intravenous anesthesia. Stable MEP recordings allow for safe completion of surgery, whereas MEP deterioration due to surgical causes should lead to early surgical intervention. Restoration of the MEP signals may prevent the occurrence of permanent new deficits.

Other functions such as language, vision, somatosensory perception, and even cognitive functions may be mapped and monitored in awake procedures or by other neurophysiologic and imaging methods.

They are costly to treat and cause poor health outcomes both for the patient and their caregivers. This paper is part of an on-going research on developing an effective immersive technology for the management of patients with BPSD. Undertaken in collaboration with healthcare professionals and scientists from the Philippines, a virtual reality (VR) game prototype is designed, curated and set within the Philippine culture. For this paper, the goals are to gather necessary factors needed to administer a therapy anchored on VR to address BPSD; and to acquire insights, comments, and recommendations on the design and architecture for further development of a VR game prototype. To achieve these goals, two focus group discussions (FGD) were conducted and a VR game prototype was enhanced based on the recommendations generated from the first FGD. Findings of this study may be used as foundations or template for future studies on VR applications for other diseases and their eventual adoption into the Philippine healthcare system.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Additionally, space activities generate environmental risks in outer space that can, at times, impact the Earth as what goes up, must inevitably come down. The hazards of spaceflight come from multiple sources, including, but not limited to, the technology used (e.g. nuclear power sources) and the hostile nature of outer space which is difficult to reach, difficult to survive in and difficult to return from. This inherent danger has been tragically highlighted not only by the shuttle disasters involving Challenger (1986) and Columbia (2003) but also by the vast field of radioactive debris left in Canada after the uncontrolled re-entry of the Soviet satellite Cosmos 954 in 1977. The latter accident exemplifies that ultra-hazardous activities require liability rules because when something goes wrong, the consequences can be significant for any injured parties.","['Law', 'International Environmental Law', 'Environmental Economics']"

Scenario reached a situation where people in search of worthy information for public health and precaution, getting fake news. This unprecedented expansion of fake information has become a challenging research issue. Deliberate efforts have been attempted in this manuscript for finding a solution to this COVID-19 fake news detection problem with the help of deep learning models. Two deep learning models—BERT, a transfer learning model, and attention-based bi-directional long short-term memory (LSTM), a memory-based model, have been applied in order to get accurate fake news classification outcomes. A comparative outcome of both models is presented which shows BERT outperforms and gives excellent results in comparison to the attention-based bi-directional LSTM model. The achieved training accuracy by BERT is 86% which is much higher than the accuracy achieved by attention-based Bi-LSTM. BERT precision, recall, and F-score are 0.82, 0.79, and 0.80, respectively, which shows that BERT can detect COVID-19 fake news better than the attention-based Bi-LSTM model.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Each print features a central image that represents one of the seven sins. However, it’s worth noting that these deadly sins have a long history that extends well before Bruegel’s time. First highlighted in the sixth century by Pope Gregory I and later elaborated on in the thirteenth century by Saint Thomas Aquinas, they were discussed in treatises and depicted in paintings and sculpture decorations on Catholic churches, as well as in old textbooks. The standard list of vices included pride, greed, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony, and sloth—behavior patterns that were thought to contribute to immoral behavior. This classification originated with the early Christian hermits referred to as the desert fathers who practiced asceticism in the Egyptian desert. As a matter of fact, it was the hermit Evagrius the Solitary, one of the most influential theologians of the late fourth-century church, who first identified the seven or eight evil spirits that people needed to overcome.","['Business and Management', 'Business Strategy/Leadership']"

The fetal heart rate variability signals during pregnancy is a biological index that must be well monitored, so as to assess the fetal well-being. This paper focuses on developing an IoT-based fetal heart monitoring device, there is accurate conformity between the newly developed device and the existing electronic stethoscope with <10% variation. The device was tested initially on the heart rate of an adult, the result was compared with the result obtained from using an exiting Doppler fetal monitor. From the result, it can be deduced that the relationship between the developed device and the standards used is linear. The device was then tested on pregnant women for detecting the heart rate of the fetus, the heart rate was monitored to determine the beats per minute. Hence, the result shows that the IoT-based monitoring device can detect the fetal heart rate as from 30 weeks upward (Third trimester).","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

The aims of this study were to determine the pre-operative physical function in patients having CRS-HIPEC and investigate the association between physical function and post-operative outcomes. Patients and Methods Patients undergoing CRS-HIPEC between 2017 and 2021 were recruited at a single quaternary referral hospital in Sydney, Australia. The primary physical function measures were the 6-min walk test (6MWT) and the five-times sit to stand test (5STS). Data were collected pre-operatively and at post-operative day 10, and were analysed according to pre-operative patient characteristics and post-operative outcomes such as length of hospital stay (LOS) and complications. Results The cohort of patients that participated in functional assessments consisted of 234 patients, with a median age of 56 years. Patients having CRS-HIPEC performed worse on the 6MWT pre-operatively compared with the general Australian population ( p < 0.001). Post-operatively, these patients experienced a further deterioration in 6MWT and 5STS performance and the degree of the post-operative decline in function was associated with post-operative morbidity. A higher level of pre-operative physical function was associated with shorter LOS and minor post-operative complications. Conclusions Patients who have undergone CRS-HIPEC were functionally impaired pre-operatively compared with the general population and experience a further deterioration of physical function post-operatively. A higher level of pre-operative physical function is associated with minor post-operative morbidity, which is highly relevant for pre-operative optimisation of patients with cancer.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery']"

These natural products have been an interest and a source of inspiration for scientists and researchers for the development and well-being of civilizations. Nowadays, modern technologies and effective scientific tools have made it possible to use such beneficiary microbes in the best possible way. Microbial-based products, especially biofertilizers and biopesticides, are known to be effective green alternatives to overcome adverse effect of chemical fertilizer and pesticides caused during green revolution. However, in India usage of such microbial-based products in agriculture is still at a very small scale. To overcome this issue, the Indian government has encouraged the use of biofertilizers and biopesticides by placing them into many of the agricultural schemes. Although, legal barriers imposed on their manufacturing, trade, import, storage, transport, and disposal restrict their production and adaptability hence, the declining interest of farmers have become a matter of concern. The main objective of this chapter is to highlight the legal provisions of the Indian laws regulating biofertilizers and biopesticides. Legal analysis stated in this chapter is based on published comparative legal research, which could enforce the manufacture process with high quality standard of biofertilizers and biopesticides present on the market and thus foster their use by farmers.","['Life Sciences', 'Agriculture', 'Microbiology', 'Microbial Genetics and Genomics']"

The goal of this project was to explore the potential for a VisitAble housing policy in Fredericton; a promising concept, but has had limited uptake in Canada. Statistics Canada data show that New Brunswick (NB) has among the highest disability rates in Canada (23%), but has the lowest rate of individuals living in a home with an accessible entrance (17%). Google Maps Street View and GeoNB were used to determine the number of zero step and ramped entrances to single-family and garden homes (as a proxy for VisitAbility) among a sample of 6 of 25 residential Dissemination Areas (DA) in Fredericton. There were 34 of 1447 homes (2.3%) that had an accessible entrance. A survey was distributed to nine Fredericton-area home builders (n = 4 responses) asking about the prevalence, demand, and the feasibility of VisitAble housing in the Fredericton house building industry. While a very small sample, the consistency of builder responses suggest they are building homes with accessible features at a rate commensurate with their interpretation of the demand and have concerns similar to those expressed in previous CMHC research. Low rates of accessible home entrances in NB suggest other provinces are more effective in the development of strategies that result in an outcome of more accessible homes. Opportunities exist to explore more prescriptive policy solutions to support VisitAble home development in NB.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

Deep learning-based methods are used in different medical imaging tasks to detect and diagnose diseases. For example, medical imaging is used to diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE), a commonly occurring cardiovascular disease with high mortality and prevalence and a low diagnosis rate. According to medical experts, PE has resulted in many deaths because of missed diagnoses for the medical condition. Another critical aspect of the disease is the possibility of permanent lung damage if left untreated. The use of deep learning methods in medical imaging is attributed to their ability to use learning-based methods to process enormous amounts of data. However, there are some unique challenges in the detection of PE. PE is not specific in its clinical presentation and is easily ignored, making it difficult to diagnose.

Recently, much effort is being devoted to studying their causes and researching methods to predict them. Medical doctors commonly use test protocols and big and expensive medical devices like a posturograph to calculate an equilibrium score, diagnose balance problems, and asses the risk of fall of their patients. In this paper we propose an alternative method to assess the falling risk based on a low-cost wearable device that can be used at home without requiring a visit to the health center. The proposed device uses an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to compute balance values. Our model has been trained on data acquired from 19 elderly patients performing the Romberg test on a Posturograph. The posturograph scores have been used as a ground truth for the training process. The results show that it is possible to detect the posture variations of patients wearing an IMU while performing the Romberg tests.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

When translated, these changes can disrupt the function of the synthesized protein. Splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are synthetic, modified nucleic acids that can correct these aberrant splicing events. They are currently in active clinical development for a number of conditions and have been approved by regulatory agencies for the treatment of neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. We have previously reported that splice-switching ASOs effectively skip a pathogenic PE that causes Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD). This erroneous PE insertion is caused by a deep-intronic variant located within intron 11 of COL6A1 (c.930+189 C>T). Here, we describe the detailed protocols and workflow that our labs have used to assess the efficacy of ASOs to skip this PE in vitro. The protocols include designing ASOs; isolating, culturing, and transfecting fibroblasts; extracting RNA and protein; and validating splicing correction at the mRNA and protein levels using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot assays, respectively.","['Biomedicine', 'Human Genetics', 'Anatomy', 'Behavioral Therapy']"

Industry injury reports contain valuable information to support the risk control and prevention programs. Systematic analysis of the risk factors on cause-and effect relationship and safety attributes of the incident injury reports can make significant contributions to the construction industry and is an ideal approach for the occupational performance and risk evaluation. A blended analysis of the occupational injuries is proposed by using an attribute-based risk assessment model together with degree of risk assessment to determine the level of injury and magnitude of safety. To enhance the current quantification method, this study quantified risk attributes associated with frequency of exposure, incident probability and potential consequence. Incident injury cases are first collected from a large number of construction-related injury reports and then classified according to the pre-assigned categorized risk factors and a list of relative safety attributes based on the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) procedures and other safety standards. The availability, quality and reliability of the data will also be assessed. Data mining-based analysis is then conducted following the attribute-based risk assessment to further reveal the associations, visualization, and correlation coefficient of risky activities and constructional hazards. The blended analysis is expected to help the construction industry identify relationships on causes of safety hazards, key safety attributes and ergonomic characteristics, as well as the level of injury and their corresponding risk controls and preventions.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

A chronic wound is typically defined as failure of the healing process to restore skin integrity after 3 months with conventional wound care. Chronic wounds negatively affect the quality of life and complicate the health of at least six million people in the United States. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are of emerging interest in the application of wound healing due to their prolonged self-renewal capacity and their ability to proliferate and induce differentiation into various cell types. Popular general therapeutic modalities can be seen in debridement, compression, pressure-relieving devices and surfaces, negative pressure, electrical stimulation, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, antimicrobials, and dressings. ASCs promote wound healing by increasing vessel density, granulation tissue thickness, and collagen deposition while simultaneously improving the cosmetic appearance of the resulting scar. The routes of delivery of ADSCs alone into the wound vary between topical administration over the wound bed, intradermal injection around the wound, intrafascial, and intramuscular injection. Despite the rapid progress in evaluating the efficacy of mesenchymal cells from adipose tissue in wound healing and the growing research, there remains issues that still need to be addressed, such as risk of malignant transformation and cancer induction and exploring the long-term safety of ASCs-derived therapeutics.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Pain Medicine', 'Orthopedics', 'Anesthesiology']"

Reclaiming unused space that has been abandoned by factories and production processes and restoring the environmental, economic and social quality of degraded neighbourhoods responds perfectly to the concept of a sustainable city. All this should be done by limiting urban sprawl and reducing the environmental impacts which are inherent in the built environment. Indeed, the consumption of land, not previously urbanised, raises the issue of direct and indirect living costs for the environment that need to be taken into account if the underlying perspective is that of sustainability. Another important issue for urban regeneration is the construction of appropriate inclusive decision-making processes. Citizen participation is pivotal for two main reasons: at one hand, it aims to identify, support, develop and sustain sustainability policies, and at the other hand, it is a tool used to achieve shared solutions. However, participation needs to be a continuous and recurring practice in order to be effective and efficient. Hence, to regenerate a city in a sustainable manner means generating more ecological benefits and social opportunities if it is appropriately planned.","['Energy', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Regional/Spatial Science', 'Archaeology']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-14466-0_7,en,One Step at a Time: Evaluation of a Step-By-Step Recipe Tool Designed for People with Dementia,OriginalPaper,"Due to dementia, people lose the ability to deal with complex tasks such as cooking. We can support this group by designing new tools to keep them active and enhance their feeling of self-worth. Previous studies have focused on step-by-step guidance for people with dementia using innovative technology, which is often too complicated to learn and set up for the users. In this paper, we designed and evaluated an intuitive, non-intimidating, step-by-step recipe tool for people living with dementia. The tool is designed for collaboration to stimulate socialisation between people with dementia or with a caregiver. The design was evaluated in situ, with 36 individuals at varying stages of dementia. Participants were instructed to cook a dish using the recipe tool and reflect on its usability. The step-by-step approach of the tool appeared highly suitable for people with dementia, and added visuals helped with understanding the recipe. The level of initiative shown by the participants with dementia seemed to depend on the amount of trust shown by the caregiver. We found that collaboration between participants during cooking as facilitated by the tool was enjoyable and highly suited for both at-home and meeting centre settings. We offer several suggestions for designing step-by-step tools and encourage facilitating more collaborative, non-intimidating activities for people with dementia and their caregivers.","['Architecture / Design', 'Industrial Design', 'Geriatric Care', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering']"

All those parameters are measured using three sets of sensors. Measurement of SO 2 has been done using SPEC DGS-SO2 and SPEC 3SP_SO2-20P which are electrochemical sensors, while the third sensor Horiba APSA 370 is based on ultraviolet fluorescent (UVF) method. Measurement of NO 2 has been done using Alphasense NO2-B43F, SPEC 3SP_NO2_5FP (both electrochemical sensors), and Horiba APNA 370 (chemiluminescence approach based) sensors. Particulate matter concentration has been monitored using Plantower PMS7003, Prana Air PAS-OUT-01 (both based on light scattering principle), and Met One Instruments BAM 1020 (based on beta attenuation method) sensors. All these sensor sets are installed at three monitoring stations (MS) namely, MS-1, MS-2, and MS-3. Current study results are compared with the previous studies. The results obtained in the current study have been compared with the previous studies. The percentage difference for PM 2.5 is found to be (−) 107.28% between MS-1 and reference study. The difference for MS-2 and MS-3 with reference study for PM 2.5 is found to be (−) 104.62% and (−) 113.74%, respectively. The difference between concentration values obtained from MS-1, MS-2, and MS-3 with reference study for PM 10 has been observed to be (−) 124.18%, (−) 131.60%, and (−) 125.39%, respectively. The percentage difference for NO 2 between MS-1 and reference study is found to be (−) 55.90%. The difference for MS-2 and MS-3 with reference study for NO 2 is found to be (−) 66.39% and (−) 58.16%, respectively. The difference between MS-1, MS-2, and MS-3 with data obtained from reference study for SO 2 has been observed to be 14.81%, 28.59%, and (−) 10.12%, respectively. Negative value indicates that observed concentration is less than reference study data. The main reason for obtaining less concentration of air quality parameters from sensors is location of sensor installation. Due to the location, the sensors are less susceptible to the pollution caused by traffic and other anthropogenic activities. The main reason for conducting current study for short period is difficulty faced during setting up and calibration of sensors of MS-1 and MS-2.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Applications', 'Geography, general', 'Sustainable Development']"

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common type of arrhythmia that can be diagnosed using an electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern. Identification of arrhythmia through ECG can be very challenging because the process is highly dependent on experts and very time consuming. The use of deep learning in automatically assisting the detection of arrhythmia using one-dimensional (1-D) input is proposed in this study. Deep learning is preferred over standard neural networks because it facilitates training in an end-to-end manner and directly trains the classification system with raw signals. This study aims to investigate the performance of 1-D convolutional neural network (CNN) for arrhythmia classification and improve its performance by introducing a hybrid approach based on long short-term memory (LSTM) approach. Experimental data are obtained from PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2017 database. ECG signals are preprocessed via filtering, QRS detection, segmentation and median wave selection. One-dimensional CNN, hybrid CNN–long short-term memory (CNN–LSTM) and hybrid CNN–bidirectional LSTM (CNN–biLSTM) models are developed and evaluated in this study to classify ECG signals into (1) normal rhythm, (2) AF rhythm, (3) other rhythms and (4) noisy signal. Accuracies of the 1-D CNN, hybrid CNN–LSTM and 1-D hybrid CNN–biLSTM models were 91.67%, 82.33% and 94.67%, respectively. The experimental results showed that the proposed CNN models can aid in atrial fibrillation (AF) diagnosis for healthcare advancement.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Health Informatics']"

In North America, landfilling is still the major waste treatment method; despite numerous stringent environmental regulations and public education programs on waste recycling. Unsustainable disposal practices and poorly managed landfills may have adverse effects on our environment, particularly from the fugitive emissions of landfill gases and toxic pollutants. As such, identification of problematic waste disposal sites and their fugitive emissions are of practical interest. The objective of the current study is to use land surface temperature as a proxy method to detect potential fugitive emission spots and their displacements at the City of Regina landfill using satellite imagery. Literature suggests higher land surface temperatures in disposal sites originate from the decomposition of organics, producing fugitive emissions of methane gas. Land surface temperature at the study area is computed using a set of empirical equations. Using a relative scale, hot spots at the Regina site are identified. Since applied remote sensing imagery is publicly available, it is believed that proposed method is equally applicable to other geo-spatial analysis of waste sites. Preliminary results for study area suggest that fugitive emissions occur near northern and southern central regions of the landfill. The southern region is larger compared to the northern one. This might be because of higher deposited waste with a higher proportion of organic material and maturity of waste, since methane gas release mostly comes from anaerobic process which occurs after aerobic decomposition.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

Even though adsorption has shown promising results in remediating As, the speciation of As poses a challenge. Bioavailability and mobility of As can be potentially improved with the addition of biochar to contaminated soil systems. Further, biochar modification can also aid in better As removal. Biochar, prepared via pyrolysis of organic materials is characterized with unique properties namely large surface area, elevated sorption capacity, ion exchange capacity, micro porosity, significant mineral, and carbon contents which are highly beneficial in water and soil remediation. The conditions of pyrolysis and the type of feedstock are two key factors that directly affect the characteristics of biochar. The abundant availability of feedstock, cost effectiveness and favorable physiochemical parameters of biochar aid in remediating metalloids like As in the environment. This chapter focuses on the principles, interactions, application of biochar in As remediation in soil and water and future perspectives.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Earth Sciences, general', 'Geography, general']"

One of the behavioral conditions encountered is related to changes in cognitive function. Many factors affect cognitive function changes in T2DM, one of which is an inflammatory condition which occurs because of hyperglycemia. Besides that, T2DM is strongly correlated with insulin resistance (IR). Inflammatory condition and IR can be caused by an increase of homocysteine (Hcy) levels. Other factors that can increase the level of homocysteine are deficiencies of vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folic acid. Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) can increase the risk of T2DM complications.

This chapter opens a small window with some examples that can serve to understand a little bit the trends of some (not all) sectors that are in full expansion all over the world simultaneously, with their pros and cons. There is a need to change the rules of the game, the paradigms to which we have so far been working with. It is not a simple exercise. It needs a lot of will and a deep understanding of what are the limits and dangers of the old model in which we still live immersed. Many examples show that the actual model runs too fast and has a direct impact on natural resources and ecosystem functioning. In this framework, aquaculture is coming under specific scrutiny. We have gone from an almost negligible aquaculture figure in the ‘70s in terms of fisheries production, to almost half of the biomass extracted from the sea and continental waters from this “farming” activity. This is a considerable achievement, but it has its consequences. The impact of monocultures (salmon, shrimp, etc.) has been, in many places, equal to or worse than overfishing. Eutrophication, salinization, introduction of drugs to contain diseases, the use of wild fish to feed mariculture species or the systematic hunting of potential predators (eagles, seals, etc.) are only some of the problems associated with aquaculture nowadays. The impact on wild ecosystems such as mangroves or fjords is very relevant, and has been highlighted as one of the most important problems to be solved in coastal waters. A new vision is that of the Integrated Multitrophic Aquaculture. This is a method that is gaining strength and that may be the change we need, especially if we move from species of high energy and carbon investment (carnivores) to those species that require less energetic effort (such as bivalves, macroalgae, holothurians, etc.). To do this, one of the first things to do is a good forecast of the impact of climate change, selecting the most suitable organisms (and areas) according to the changing environmental conditions. The regional possibilities (i.e., those areas that may be suitable for a mariculture expansion) and the carrying capacity of the surrounding ecosystems according to different areas must also be taken into account if we want a significant paradigm change. Also, the inclusion of stakeholders and clear co-governance roles of these kind of infrastructures has to be understood as a tool to a successful management of the products that will be available for the local people. The Blue Growth related to the mariculture is not the only open front for the future. The use of microalgae is another type of approach to a future in which low-energy cost organisms are gradually taking center stage. The possibilities have a wide spectrum, and now these microorganisms are beginning to be applied industrially in nutraceuticals, biofuels or for the generation of interesting molecules for biomedical applications. The solutions are there, and changing the priorities and the way we apply the different discoveries to be in line with SDG14 in this Blue Growth strategy is a challenge. In fact, it is not all positive prospects in Blue Growth. There are cases in which excessive acceleration of production and inadequate management of “new generation” resources can cause stress on systems, especially in places with fragile ecosystem balances. In addition, considering the production of alternative energies such as offshore wind, or the new planning of maritime traffic, we have to deeply change our way to proceed. The Blue Growth roadmap must change the paradigm if we really want to consider it sustainable. New solutions and new perspectives in a changing world that require spatial planning and a very different model of resource management than the one we are now applying are urgently needed, considering new models of production, economy and social interaction.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"

Renal biomarkers including serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) are all associated with the incidence and severity of DR; better control of these renal biomarkers may help slow down the progression of DR. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of blindness resulting from DR; the main treatment is intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents nowadays. Patients with low eGFR may have poorer visual outcome after anti-VEGF treatment for DME. Patients with albuminuria tend to have more severe serous-type macular edema at baseline, but respond well to anti-VEGF treatment.

However, often these wearables collect various sensitive personal information of a user with no to limited authentication, e.g., knowledge-based external authentication techniques, such as PINs. While most of these external authentication techniques suffer from multiple limitations, including recall burden, human errors, or biases, researchers have started using various physiological and behavioral data, such as gait and heart rate, collected by the wearables to authenticate a wearable user implicitly with a limited accuracy due to sensing and computing constraints of wearables. In this work, we explore the usefulness of blood oxygen saturation ( SpO 2 ) values collected from the Oximeter device to distinguish a user from others. From a cohort of 25 subjects, we find that 92% of the cases SpO 2 can distinguish pairs of users. From detailed modeling and performance analysis, we observe that while SpO 2 alone can obtain an average accuracy of 0.69 and F 1 score of 0.69, the addition of heart rate (HR) can improve the average identification accuracy by 15% and F 1 score by 13%. These results show promise in using SpO 2 along with other biometrics to develop implicit continuous authentications for wearables.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Professional Computing']"

Continuous high blood sugar levels will eventually damage vital organs and lead to complications in various systems such as the circulatory, immune, and nervous systems. Complications associated with T2D affect quality of life and are the leading causes of death, thus representing a major public health burden. Considering the complex nature of T2D and complication development, exploiting epigenetic modifications holds the promise of detecting powerful biomarkers for the early detection of complications and providing potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Impressively, advances in epigenetic profiling during the past 20 years have allowed biomarker discovery targeting not only 5-methylcytosines (5mC), the most investigated epigenetic system to date, but also novel epigenetic modifications, particularly 5-hydroxymenthylcytosines (5hmC). Notably, the 5hmC are biochemically stable cytosine modifications that show a distinct genomic distribution and gene regulatory function from 5mC. Earlier studies have implicated 5hmC in complex diseases including cancer and cardiovascular diseases and explored their biomarker value using circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) derived from plasma. Considering the need for convenient epigenetic tools in clinical applications, in this chapter, we focus our discussion on the most recent advances in detecting 5hmC biomarkers for diabetic complications using a liquid biopsy- (i.e., cfDNA)-based approach.

The design and implementation of an IoT-based security surveillance system employing Node MCUs and Wi-Fi network connectivity is described in this study. Adding wireless fidelity to embedded systems offers up a world of possibilities, such as worldwide monitoring and control, secure data storage, and much more. Sensor nodes and a controller part make up this surveillance system. Remote user alerts and mobility are two of the system’s primary features. When a Wi-Fi connected microcontroller is integrated with a PIR sensor, the sensor looks for object movements and sends an alert to the user via an online cloud platform (ThingSpeak). This surveillance system is made up of sensor nodes and a controller. Two of the system’s main characteristics are remote user alerts and mobility.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This work has the twofold purpose of analysing the role of PPT in the Leave campaign and discussing its implications from a theoretical standpoint. The chapter consists of four parts. The first one includes an overview of the literature on European disintegration, Brexit, and post-truth; it also offers a conceptualisation of post-factual politics, discussing how the notion evolved and how it relates to misinformation. The second part consists of an analysis of the Leave campaign; it identifies the actors behind misinformation and their role before and during the referendum campaign. The third section is an empirical analysis of the discourse on Brexit, with a focus on factually ambiguous or incorrect statements. The ties between deception and politics are further analysed in the fourth part, attempting to describe to which extent, during a crisis, political actors can exploit pre-existing ideological forces to construct a specific narrative. The conclusion addresses the effectiveness of misinformation on the Leave campaign and whether a similar approach will play a more significant role in the ongoing debate on EU integration. The ambition of the chapter is to analyse misinformation as a tool to create consensus, looking at the actors employing it, its effectiveness, and its role as a causal factor in the Leave campaign and the process of European disintegration.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Political Sociology', 'Political Communication']"

Prior to investigating disease microbiome biomarkers, a healthy state of biomarkers needs to be established. These can vary based on different conditions (including gender). We used the currently available technology to try to discover the difference between the microbiome of a different gender as this can help guide personalized medicine. We trained a Random Forest classifier model that used fecal 16S rRNA sequence data to differentiate between male and female subjects based on the same age, BMI, country of residence, and diet. Before the classification process, bioinformatics analysis was performed using the QIIME2–2020.2 tool which resulted in profiling microbiome communities present in host organisms. The Alpha diversity test that was conducted afterward did not discover differences in male and female subjects. Prior to classification, feature selection has been performed using the forests of trees to evaluate the importance of features in the dataset. It was experimented with 95%, 90%, and 85% coverage of features for each classification run. 5-fold cross-validation yielded high accuracy results on multiple subsets (subjects in the 30s, subjects in the 40s, non-omnivores), going above 80%. Our results have shown that Random Forest, as a stable algorithm, can be modeled on microbiome data to achieve high precision (close to 90%) with relatively few parameters. This suggests that the microbiome of different genders is highly distinguishable, and that gender is a possible suitable marker for personalized decision-making in medicine that involves gut microbiome data. The new methods of analysis of gut microbiome data can be used to confirm these results with more precise analysis.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The population in the higher age groups is a result of scientific and technological progress in the economic, social and medical fields. Although ageing is the final stage of a person’s life cycle, it is not necessary to perceive it as a threat but rather as a thoughtful possibility of active ageing. Generation 50 and more is known as the silver generation, which is mainly made up of a generation known as the baby boomer. It includes a generation of younger seniors 50–60 years old and over 65 years old. The silver generation is becoming more and more important economic and societal strength, which is growing in society, as the labour shortage continues to grow. It creates jobs, directly, through its own business or, indirectly, by caring for it. It is a significant group of potential consumers, who, in addition to established products, require brand new products. This generation is a strong group of potential consumers. It is therefore necessary to pay increased attention to it, in particular to its claims and requirements, including retail. The aim of this chapter is to identify the factors that determine the choice of shopping in retail entities, determine the types of shopping behaviour of both types of silver generation and point out their specifics in two regional cities of Western Slovakia, Nitra and Trnava, characterized by automotive industry. The chapter is based on a behavioural survey conducted in both regional cities and evaluated by the standard methods.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Facility Management']"

When it comes to the construction industry, safety culture is relatively new to the industry, and the nature of work is totally different when compared with other sectors of industries because the human behaviour and labour challenges vary from one construction sector to another sector. Employee’s safety is based on their safety culture, safety habits and safety awareness. Workplace culture is the basic reason that leads to many of the incidents and accidents that happen in the construction industry. The nature of worker’s behaviour in the industry is closely linked to the safety culture. A good safety culture shows how much the company is dedicated to their safety policy and it should be supported by the senior management. For an efficient foundation of the safety management system, the safety awareness should be an integral part and become a culture within the construction sector. With the help of this work, an insight is given to develop and maintain safety culture into organization. It broadly covered the various aspects to be consider for enhancing safety culture along with their pattern of implementation for assuring the establishment towards their best safety culture.

However, less is known about the gradients for preventive measures, including their respective prevalence and effectiveness. This chapter partly fills this gap with an analysis based on data from both 1856 fire fatalities in Sweden between 1999 and 2018 and a national survey performed in Sweden in 2018. This implies that the results are specific for Sweden, but there is reason to believe that the situation is similar in most other western countries. The results indicate, for example, that the effectiveness Effectiveness of smoke alarms decreases with age, especially for smokers, and therefore, additional measures are needed for these groups. Examples of effective additional measures are detector-activated sprinkler systems, fire-resistant clothing and safe cigarettes (e.g. e-cigarettes). Concerning the prevalence of preventive measures, the result shows that non-Europeans living in Sweden have a much lower level of fire Fires protection. Also, for example, low income Income , being divorced and living in a rented apartment are all linked to a lower protection level. Younger individuals tend to own smoke alarms to the same extent as older individuals, but they tend not to test them, which give room for improvement. Younger people, however, own extinguishers and fire Fires blankets to a larger extent than older people, but homeownership was the strongest determinant for ownership of extinguishers.","['Engineering', 'Fire Science, Hazard Control, Building Safety', 'Psychology, general', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Public Policy', 'Building Construction and Design']"

Therefore, the quality of decision processes is critical to your success as leader. In knowledge organizations such as hospitals, a process with several steps is needed before a decision is valid. When making big decisions with irreversible or long-term effects, one should be aware of the risk of biases which may lead to suboptimal or even wrong decisions. First, make sure that alternative solutions are fully explored, independently from the decision makers. Second, ask yourself if the decision makers have fallen in love with their own solution, and therefore are blind for its weaknesses. Third, unanimous decisions on complex issues may suggest that decision makers have degenerated into group think. Fourth, be careful when consulting companies are involved as their own interest, such as hope for future contracts, acts like a momentum, which drives the process forward.

Current OMA methods for rotating machines introduce data-pre-processing to adapt classical identification methods. However, they show strong limitations and rely on strong assumptions, such as the isotropy of the rotor, making them hardly applicable in practice. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes to employ the Floquet theory of periodic system to approximate rotating systems as time invariant systems. Thus, classical identification methods can be used to retrieve the parametric signature of the periodic systems. This Floquet-based approximation gives a physical meaning to the identified eigenmodes. The proposed approach is validated on both a small numerical model and an aero-servo-elastic numerical model of a rotating 10 MW wind turbine, with isotropic and anisotropic rotors, using the stochastic subspace identification to retrieve the modes and their uncertainty.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Improving comfort is the key condition to attract more passengers. On train journeys, the comfort is highly influenced by vibration, which derives from train motion and results in whole-body vibration. This type of vibration is evaluated by the ISO 2631 standard.Following the international standard, the present study performs a ride comfort evaluation on the Alfa Pendular trains regarding the Porto Campanhã – Lisbon Oriente connection. Measurements were performed on the floor, seat surface and seatback, run on both seat classes. Regarding the ride comfort evaluation, it should be highlighted that low acceleration values were found for all journeys. Maximum discomfort peaks were obtained on the middle of train. The journeys were ranked as “little uncomfortable” or “not uncomfortable” during around 97% of its duration, concerning the seat surface evaluation. This value increased up to 99% for the seatback. It was also observed that when compared with the floor, the seat surface amplifies the total acceleration during the entire trip. This was the first study evaluating vibration comfort on Portuguese trains.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Complexity']"

However, the expense of this is immense and the process is so complicated that a large population does not offer these services. So by using low-cost ECG with ESP32 module can check the heart monitoring. In this project, ESP32 module and AD8232 ECG sensor module were used without using Arduino board. Using ESP32 module can check the heart monitoring through online from anywhere or anyplace in this world. Ubidots platform is best IoT platform to connect the things and visualize the data. Ubidots have wide number of knowledge visualizing options, and it is an attention grabbing user-friendly interface. Signup by providing all the required details. After installing the required libraries in Arduino IDE, connect the ESP32 module to computer/laptop to upload the program. After successfully uploading in open serial monitor, on the serial monitor, we will see our ESP32 successfully connected to the programmed Wi-Fi and allocated with IP address. Then, it initiated MQTT connection with Ubidot cloud and connected to it. Then, it started publishing ECG data alongside a time stamp. Each data packet contains a variable label and 4 precise time-stamp data points. You can see the live Electrocardiogram on the Ubidots dashboardor platform. Ubidots will receive data from our ESP32 Module and plot the variable on the graph with provided Epoch Timestamp. Since we are sending data with timestamp, there will be no delay due to server latency on the graph. This helps to plot an exact electrocardiogram for Ubidots.

Two methods of training the autoencoder are evaluated, namely backpropagation and extreme learning machines. The root mean square (RMS) error in the reconstruction of successive fragments of the measured DC motor angular-frequency signal, which is fed to the input of autoencoder, is used to determine the health indicator (HI). A complete test bench is built using a Raspberry Pi system (i.e., motor driver controlling angular frequency) and Jetson Nano (i.e., embedded compute node to estimate motor degradation) to perform exploratory analysis of autoencoders for condition-based monitoring and comparison of several classical artificial intelligence algorithms. The experiments include detection of degradation of DC motor working in both constant and variable work points. Results indicate that the HI obtained with the autoencoders trained with the use of either training method is suitable for both work points. Next, an experiment with multiple autoencoders trained on each specific work point and running in parallel is reviewed. It is shown that, in this case, the minimum value of RMS error among all autoencoders should be taken as HI. Furthermore, it has been shown that there is a near-linear relationship between HI and the difference between measured and reconstructed angular-frequency waveforms.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Computational Intelligence']"

To properly design a mechanical device against fatigue failure, a long test campaign involving many specimens and time must be performed according to traditional fatigue tests protocol. However, fatigue is a very dissipative phenomenon in which a large amount of energy is dissipated in the surrounding environment. Moving from this assumption, the adoption of infrared thermography can dramatically decrease the amount of time to obtain reliable information regarding the fatigue life of materials and components. Risitano Thermographic Method (RTM) links the superficial temperature during a fatigue test with the dissipated energy for a given stress level. The whole fatigue life of a specimen is represented by an Energy Parameter, strictly dependent on the test frequency and stress ratio, and this allow to obtain, even with one specimen, the entire fatigue curve. The Static Thermographic Method (STM) allows to assess the first damage in a specimen subjected to static tensile test by monitoring the superficial temperature evolution. The obtained limit stress could be directly related with the onset of fatigue damage within the material if cyclically stressed. The aim of the present work is to investigate the relation between the energy release and the damage at different stress ratios within a stainless steel AISI 316L, both under static tensile and fatigue tests using RTM and STM. Moreover, microstructure analysis is carried out to identify possible failure sites.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

In order to extract the features with time sequence information better for prediction, we propose a data-driven method using multi-step long short-term memory (MS-LSTM) network for predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of bearings. Firstly, stacked denoised autoencoder (SDAE) and self-organizing maps (SOM) are combined to construct one-dimensional health index (HI) curve according to the original vibration signal, and then the HI curve is input into the MS-LSTM network to predict the long term future trend. Finally, the remaining useful life is calculated according to the failure threshold. Compared with the existing advanced methods, it achieves an absolute improvement of RMSE by 13.63% in the whole remaining life prediction and 7.43% in the last 840 steps.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics']"

However, its effects on axillary lymph nodes and lymph node yield (LNY) following axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) remain unclear. Given the importance of LNY for accurate axillary staging in patients with breast cancer, we retrospectively reviewed a large national cancer database to determine if NAC has an effect on LNY following axillary surgery. Methods A retrospective review of the National Cancer Database was performed. Patients diagnosed from 2010 to 2015 with T0–T4, clinical N0–3, and M0 breast cancer who underwent ALND were included. Patients were categorized by NAC and primary surgery (PS). A descriptive analysis of patient and tumor characteristics, as well as extrinsic factors, was performed. A univariate analysis using Student’s t -test was performed to evaluate LNY between the two groups. Results A total of 118,108 patients were included in our study. We found that 29,066 (24.6%) patients underwent NAC, and 89,042 (75.4%) had surgery as initial treatment (PS group). The median LNY by ALND in the NAC group was 11 (Q1, Q3: 6, 16). The median LNY in the PS group was 11 (Q1, Q3: 6, 17), p < 0.001. Conclusion Despite differences in patient characteristics and external factors, we found no difference in LNY following ALND between patients who underwent NAC and those who had initial surgery. Efforts should be made to achieve equivalent LNY whether or not patients receive NAC.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery']"

As remittances are sent directly to families and friends living at the place of origin, they have a significant impact on alleviating poverty. The literature on remittances suggests that most remittance-receiving households in urban areas use a major portion of the remitted income for food purchase–indicating a close relationship between remittances and food security. However, understanding of how remittances are related to urban food security is still limited. More specifically, what is the role of remittances in overcoming food insecurity both directly (as an additional means available to access food), and indirectly (as a source of investment for income-generating activities)?

Since phosphorus is poorly available in the soil rhizosphere, phosphorus stress occurs in susceptible crop plants. Phosphorus use efficiency may be improved by adapting phenotyping characters such as root, shoot, plant height, canopy structure, rhizosphere, photosynthesis, chlorophyll contents, biomass, and leaf area index. Here we review sensors for plant phenotyping and applications. Phenotyping assessment can be done using red, green and blue wavelength cameras, multispectral and hyperspectral imaging cameras, and thermal infrared cameras. In some plants, young leaves, meristems, flowers, transfer approximately half of the phosphorus back to the xylem. The proliferation of the lateral and shallow roots in rice may enhance the exploration of inorganic phosphate in the topsoil. Many plant species use arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to promote foraging and access to phosphorus. Vegetative and physiological traits are closely linked to phosphorus use efficiency.

However, owing to potential toxicities, the risk–benefit ratio of pembrolizumab must be considered. There is consensus that the addition of immunotherapy should be recommended in node-positive patients. This study is undertaken to determine nodal positivity rates in patients with TNBC presenting with cT1–2N0 disease undergoing upfront surgery and to evaluate the utility of axillary ultrasound and biopsy in the setting of a negative clinical examination. Patients and Methods Patients with cT1–2N0 TNBC undergoing upfront surgery were identified from our institutional database (January 2016–February 2021; n = 343) and from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) ( n = 46,015). Pathologic nodal status was determined. A second cohort of patients with cT1–T2 TNBC with a negative clinical examination was defined in our institutional database ( n = 499), and utilization of axillary ultrasound was examined. Results For patients undergoing upfront surgery, pathologically positive nodes were found in 14.6% patients of our institutional cohort: 9.4% cT1a/b, 14.9% cT1c, and 20.8% cT2 tumors. In the NCDB cohort, 13.7% patients were node positive: 4.9% cT1a/b, 11.4% cT1c, and 19.7% cT2 tumors. For patients with a normal clinical examination undergoing axillary ultrasound, 7.5% of cT1c and 8.7% of cT2 had suspicious nodes biopsied and confirmed positive for metastasis. Conclusions Pathologic node-positive disease is found in > 10 and 20% patients with cT1cN0 and cT2N0 TNBC, respectively.

The challenge of building inclusive and sustainable cities in the context of rapid urbanization is arguably the critical development issue of the twenty-first century and creating food secure cities is key to promoting health, prosperity, equity, and ecological sustainability. The expansion of Africa’s urban population is taking place largely in secondary cities. These are broadly defined as cities with fewer than half a million people that are not national political or economic centres. The implications of secondary urbanization have recently been described by the Cities Alliance as “a real knowledge gap,” requiring much additional research not least because it poses new intellectual challenges for academic researchers and governance challenges for policymakers. International researchers coming from multiple points of view, including food studies, urban studies, and sustainability studies, are starting to heed the call for further research into the implications for food security of rapidly growing secondary cities in Africa.","['Social Sciences', 'Human Geography', 'Urban Studies/Sociology', 'Public Policy', 'Sustainable Development', 'Environmental Policy', 'Sociology, general']"

Urbanism is the leading soul of our lives in work, housing, education, and open spaces. We experience urban patterns all day long through different steps (design, structure, environmental behavior, life cycle). Sustainable urban planning is a new trend that has emerged in recent decades and has become part of the design of some architects, helping to protect the environment and save resources. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is an excellent achievement for the building, engineering, and construction industries as a fantastic arrangement of execution equipment configurations and is of great interest throughout the structural life cycle. The incredible impact of BIM shifted not only construction efficiency but also information that supports current and future urban growth, improving quality of life and contributing to the growth of the country’s economy. In addition, Sustainable Urban Planning focused on promoting the long-term survival of cities by reducing consumption, waste, harmful effects on people and places, and improving overall health. Another trend to consider cities and practices for building cities (urbanism) is the study of how inhabitants of urban areas, such as towns and cities, interact with the built environment. Building Information Modelling (BIM) mechanisms applied at the city planning level help provide comprehensive data for guiding and improving the sustainability of cities, which is Urban Information Modelling (CIM). This will involve optimizing the demand for new buildings, infrastructure, and services through, for example, considering users’ needs, both building and the wider community. It will also influence the broader supply of buildings and infrastructure by seeking greater efficiency and effectiveness. This paper aims to present an invented vision towards an interactive connection between (CIM) and Sustainable Urbanism to enhance the quality of life and city livability.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Arts', 'Building Construction and Design']"

Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are a good example of learning systems where PII concerns may hamper data analysis, the well-being of users, and system innovation. PII is particularly hard to locate and clean because of the variations in formatting, texts, and assignments found in unstructured data. In particular, identifying and removing students’ names has proven difficult. This study examines the potential to use large, pre-trained language models to de-identify MOOC data and compares performance on these language models to human annotations. On a validation set, a pre-trained language model fine-tuned using spaCy default hyperparameters achieved 97% recall of student names in the validation set, including partial matches, and 30% precision. On a larger, unseen test set (n = 3,077), the model achieved 93% recall and 24% precision. The majority of the false positives leading to lower recall in the test set were known names belonging to authors and/or lecturers. The results of the ensemble approach used here show considerable promise for a difficult de-identification task and indicate that automated de-identification is, likely, mature enough for use on some education datasets. Clearing PII from smart learning systems would ethically protect learners within the systems, allowing for the release of large datasets that could be analyzed for intelligent insights to forward innovation within smart learning systems.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Sociology, general', 'Big Data', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

An anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is a routinely performed surgery whose purpose is to relieve spinal stenosis, remove intervertebral disk and bony matter which may be impinging upon neural elements, and to mechanically stabilize the cervical spine after such material is removed. The safety of an ACDF for patients with cervical radiculopathy, with or without neurophysiologic monitoring, is extremely high, with very low rates of temporary or permanent neurologic sequelae. The risk of neurologic injury during an ACDF for those patients with myelopathic symptoms and requiring a cervical corpectomy, laminectomy, or foraminotomy, while unknown, is thought to be higher than that for patients with radiculopathy alone. Posterior cervical spine surgery is usually performed for multilevel compression, instability of the spine, fracture, degenerative disk disease, or stabilization. Common posterior cervical surgical procedures include laminoplasty, laminectomy with or without instrumentation and fusion, and laminotomy.

Among the behavioral and physiological disturbances, changes in daily biological processes such as the sleep-wake cycle or hormonal rhythmic release are the most affected. People suffering of mood disorders (e.g., depression) show delays in the onset of sleep, awakenings during sleep, or sleepiness at daytime. Inversely, people experiencing circadian misalignment (e.g., jet lag, shift work) exhibit mood-related symptoms, emphasizing the reciprocal connection between affective and circadian disorders. Moreover, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments that improve daily rhythms have important benefit effects in emotional states, indicating that the circadian system is a good entrance for the successful treatment of mood disorders. Thereby, to understand the physiological mechanisms underlying mood alterations induced by disruptions of daily physiology, it is important to develop and use valid animal models that simulate human circadian activity.","['Biomedicine', 'Neurosciences']"

These interactions are often critical to the basic developmental processes of cellular proliferation and differentiation, as well as to both the onset of disease sequelae and prevention of disease progression. In many tissues, proteoglycans and especially their glycosaminoglycan (GAG) components are mediators of these processes. The GAG family is characterized by covalently linked repeating disaccharides forming long unbranched polysaccharide chains. Thus far in higher eukaryotes, the family consists of chondroitin sulfate (CS), heparin/heparan sulfate (HS), dermatan sulfate (DS), keratan sulfate (KS) and hyaluronan (HA). All GAG chains (except HA) are characteristically modified by varying amounts of esterified sulfate. One or more GAG chains are usually found in nature bound to polypeptide backbones in the form of proteoglycans; HA is the exception. In the nervous system, GAG/proteoglycan-mediated interactions participate in proliferation and synaptogenesis, neural plasticity, and regeneration.

Thus, this work introduces a resistive paper-based sensor for sensing glucose in sweat using the molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) method, which allows to create specific molecular templates for target detection. Our sensor is based on MIP over eco-friendly paper strips and screen-printed electrodes, coupled with a simple read-out hardware for wireless data streaming, ideal for wearable devices. We show the sensor fabrication stage and characterization tests in glucose levels from 0 to 80 $$\mu $$ μ M, achieving a detection limit of 4.2 $$\mu $$ μ M. The results show that our sensor is a low-cost and attractive alternative towards a sweat glucose wearable sensor, with high reliability, low detection limit, and easy fabrication process.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering', 'Bioinformatics']"

Its use facilitates the rehabilitation of patients and increases their participation in daily life. However, unlike some countries like the USA, Japan and Germany, in practice, these technologies are not necessarily available in Latin American countries due to a lack of resources, and demographic access barriers. In this work we present the design, development, and preliminary evaluation in terms of functionality and usability of MoveLeg, a low-cost assistive device for the motor rehabilitation of the lower limbs of patients with sequelae of stroke. The proposed device is based on design insights obtained from 14 motor rehabilitation specialists from different institutions, with characteristics that allow to: (i) care for remote patients, (ii) manage the therapy program online, (iii) personalize and monitor each session based on a mirror therapy, and (iv) decrease the intensity or stop the exercise in real-time. The results of the preliminary functional evaluation establish that the device is working properly. In addition, the results of the usability evaluation with an older adult and a physiotherapist suggest that the device is perceived as easy to use, easy to learn, and with a high intention to use, while providing motor tele-rehabilitation in real-time, in a supervised and safe way.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The pollutant from the burning pyrotechnic products causes ill health effects to all the living beings in the environment. The particulate matters like oxides of nitrogen (NO x ) exhausted out due to these pyrotechnic burning remains suspended in the atmospheric air for longer period of time in the size PM 2.5 and PM 10 (Tian et al. in Atmospheric Chemistry And Physics, China, 2014; Lin et al. in Air and Waste Management Association, Taiwan, 2016; Godri et al. in Environmental Science and Technology, U.K, 2010), which are easily diluted in the blood stream of the living beings when inhaled, ingested and injected by direct or indirect mode. So, in this piece of works, the future generation pyrotechnic chemical composition containing sodium oxalate as an oxidizer replacing barium nitrate is studied. A pyrotechnic product namely ground chakkar was made using the existing and proposed chemical composition. Also, in another study modifications in the existing chemical composition is carried out by reducing the dextrin content. Mechanical sensitivity analysis  was performed for the existing, modified and alternate chemical composition according to the standard procedure dictated in-EN 13,631–3. The test result shows that the use of an alternate chemical composition is safer  and it belongs to class III explosive (sensitive) whereas the existing chemical composition belongs to class IV explosive (very sensitive). The new generation proposed energetic chemical composition mixture is completely free from barium nitrate and it is better as well as safer to handle.","['Physics', 'Electronic Circuits and Devices', 'Materials Science, general', 'Optics, Lasers, Photonics, Optical Devices']"

Individual countries are struggling with the effects of the pandemic. The pandemic has resulted in significant global social and economic disruption , including the largest global recession since the Great Depression . Many countries are introducing lockdowns; that is, individual institutions, restaurants, factories, and schools are closed; people’s stays are restricted (thus eliminating physical contact); and many preventive measures are introduced. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, individual educational institutions were forced to switch from full-time to distance learning. As part of distance education, individual institutions had to react promptly and adapt their educational process. This chapter compares students’ approach to study before and during a pandemic and analyzes in more detail the method of distance learning during a pandemic. The research analyzes the forms and content of teaching, especially the use of innovative educational technologies and methods and ways of communication between teachers and students, and compares teaching at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic and during its second wave.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Facility Management']"

Process mining helps interconnect event logs data and find any patterns in the process flows. Process mining (PM) provides a simple visualization to identify and organize data available in the healthcare system. We collected information from the hospital and applied PM methods. We processed structured and unstructured data and models using PM algorithms. Hospitals generate events logs that are considered complex and inconsistent. We found deviations and inconsistencies by comparing an existing process model with the event logs. In this paper, we created the design of Petri nets and analyzed the abnormality of the process flow. We propose an effective model to detect deviations using the event logs. Then, the abnormal activities are identified and displayed on the Petri nets. The Petri nets create clusters of dependent activities. The healthcare information from the hospital is used in the research process to convey our work.

Common gantry- and robotic arm-based systems impose scalability limitations based on the printer size. Several research efforts proposed using multiple mobile 3D printers towards large-scale printing, relying however on unrealistic assumptions of continuous communication among all agents. Here, we explore an active sensing framework allowing individual agents to assess other agents’ progress without directly communicating with them. Our approach leverages environmental modifications introduced by each agent during printing to track the structure evolution. We focus on heat conduction in the structure, which we discretize as a 2D lattice embodying its topology. Using on-board sensors, agents measure temperature and heat at their location, which they use to infer structure’s topology. From the input-output time-series and prior knowledge of the printing task, an agent identifies the system state-matrix by using a subspace identification method and solving an inverse eigenvalue problem. We demonstrate the validity of our approach through numerical simulations, establishing conditions for successful inference. We highlight the potential of the framework in facilitating information flow among agents through the physical medium, paving the way for decentralized collective mobile 3D printing.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

The paradigm shift fueled by rapid data generation and higher storage capabilities has resulted in a massive transition across data storage technologies. Traditional database management systems being used in record-based transactional applications are paving the way for new rapid engagement-based data stores leading the newer applications. This transition is a result of a sharp growth trajectory witnessed across many parallel technology landscapes including cloud for storage and processing, Internet of things (IoT) for rapid data generation and transmission, support for unstructured, semi-structured and structured data by social media platforms, and polyglot persistence supported by NoSQL, to name a few. The emerging applications thrive on insights acquired by data analytics, and immutability of data storage is expected to be one of the key factors in growth of forward leaning enterprises. There has been a constant rise in application development requiring a full history of transactions, which is both trustworthy and traceable. Such applications mandate the append-only nature of the data storage to support analytics and trust. Immutability is also the underlying premise of popular cloud native storage systems. This paper explores blockchain technology as a solution for privacy and disclosure compliance in stored healthcare data. Blockchain as a data structure is primed to store only small amounts of data to maintain the properties of immutability, tamper proofing, security, and transparency in applications and is not suitable for storing big data. However, healthcare blockchain implementations have several possibilities for storage management, and the paper presents a comparative analysis of the aggregation-based storage with IoT-based streaming e-healthcare application data for the use case. The in-depth analysis for the potential blockchain storage in the paper includes the cost factors, in addition to immutability and privacy preservation, and the results show that costs may be saved up to an order of magnitude 300 with aggregation.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

Manufacturing in the Internet-of-Thing (IoT) era will be more efficient, better quality, easier to manage, and more transparent through integration of physical and cyber technologies in Industry 4.0-based smart factories. Factory automation relies heavily on sensors and AI to make the system intelligent. Sensor technology advancements and developments linked to Industry 4.0 serve as the backbone for the inclusive expansion of industry and the economic success of any country. It is imperative that manufacturing organizations and supply chains have access to the latest low-cost sensor technology for collecting data and putting it to good use. Standard sensor types include position sensors, flow, temperature, flow rate, pressure, and force. A wide range of fields, including motorsport, health care, manufacturing, the armed forces, and agriculture all make use of them on a day-to-day basis. Increasing efficiency through automation is the goal of Industry 4.0. The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief overview and viewpoint on the most recent advancements in AI and the associated problems. Attempts to define the main ideas and tools behind this new era of manufacturing in the early years of the so-called fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) always ended up referring to the concept of smart machines that could communicate with each other and with the environment. When it comes to the new industry 4.0, it’s the defined cyber physical systems connected by the IoT that get all the attention. Nonetheless, several tools and applications will benefit the new industrial environment, complementing the actual formation of a smart, embedded system capable of performing autonomous tasks. And the majority of these revolutionary ideas are based on the same background theory as artificial intelligence, in which the analysis and filtration of massive amounts of incoming data from various types of sensors aids in the interpretation and recommendation of the best course of action. As a result, artificial intelligence science is well suited to the challenges that arise during the fourth industrial revolution’s consolidation.

The use of private vehicles as daily commute to transport students to and from schools has caused school-related traffic congestion and air pollution problems. The after school waiting bay of most schools in urban areas is normally very crowded with students waiting for transport to travel home. Teachers on duty and school student council members are assigned to monitor and control the crowded situation. Some schools implement drive-thru pickup procedure in which the teacher on duty need to be very attentive and observe the cars approaching the bay for pickup in order to queue up the students at the pickup bay. With the outbreak of pandemic COVID-19, the teachers not only need to observe the vehicles heading to the pickup bay but to ensure the students obey social distancing norms. To alleviate after school pickup related problems, a mobile application for after school pickup is proposed. With this application, the school teachers would be able to obtain a list of pickup requests from the parents via the mobile application and queue up the students accordingly with safe social distancing at the pickup bay. This can ease the crowded situation, minimize parents’ waiting time at the pickup lane, and reduce air pollution problem caused by vehicle engines that are running while waiting at the pickup lane.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The fire models can be used to determine the emission of a fire, as well as determine the safety related to smoke and heat exposure for the building occupants. A brief history of fire models is shown, together with a description of the concept of design fires. Dispersion models varying in complexity from simple box and Gaussian plume, to complex Eulerian grid and Lagrangian particle models, allow determining the smoke dispersion over large areas (far-field), including the wind effects on the pollutant distribution. In the case of the most advanced models, they include mesoscale meteorological models and sub-models for complex phenomena, e.g. chemical reactions between smoke particles and air, soot agglomeration and sedimentation. CFD method provides unmatched resolution in the near-field, allowing investigation of building wake and downwash effects on the smoke contamination. As CFD method is commonly used in fire modelling, expansion of the area of interest to building surroundings may result in a more in-depth overview of the consequences of building fires. The chapter provides an elaborate introduction to wind and fire coupled modelling, including tips for building and discretizing the numerical domain and the introduction of the wind into the numerical model. Literature examples of modelling wind and fire are presented.

Life course theory/perspective suggests a multidisciplinary paradigm. It suggests to examine how people live in different structural contexts and how economic, social and cultural changes influence attitudes towards older people and their presence in public life. The social context is defined in micro and macro scales (e.g. individual and family situations of persons in different stages of their life, their economic situation, occupational experience, social activities) within different societies. The basic assumption is that a particular life course stage of a person influences subsequent experiences and also attitudes towards seniors. As predicted age, gender, education, and life satisfaction are factors that differentiate attitudes. The differences found in 1990 are still observed to some extent in 2012. A significant proportion of respondents expect older people to withdraw to the private sphere. Some of them expect older people to be active in non-governmental organizations, informal assistance relationships, institutions established for older people which allow the needs of older people to be satisfied. In reality older people are kept on the margins of mainstream public life. The data of World Values Survey conducted in 2012 have been used in the analyses shown in the chapter. Eleven countries have been selected to show the situation in different countries with different history and welfare systems. The data are unique. The set of questions asked internationally in the wave of the study has not been included in the next waves of WVS. However, we may consider that the findings presented in the chapter are important for understanding the actual situation of older people, the perception of their social and cultural capital, the respondents’ willingness to see them as part of labour force and to be included in public life. The recent statistical data and reports show that older people are still poorly represented on decision-making positions in politics and economic institutions.","['Social Sciences', 'Life course', 'Labor Economics', 'Aging', 'Social Structure, Social Inequality', 'Sociology of Work']"
