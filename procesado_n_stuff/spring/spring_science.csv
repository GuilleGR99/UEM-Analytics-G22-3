doi:10.1007/s42064-022-0144-2,en,A review of dynamic analysis on space solar power station,"['ReviewPaper', 'Review Article']","The concept of a space solar power station (SSPS) was proposed in 1968 as a potential approach for solving the energy crisis. In the past 50 years, several structural concepts have been proposed, but none have been sent into orbit. One of the main challenges of the SSPS is dynamic behavior prediction, which can supply the necessary information for control strategy design. The ultra-large size of the SSPS causes difficulties in its dynamic analysis, such as the ultra-low vibration frequency and large flexibility. In this paper, four approaches for the numerical analysis of the dynamic problems associated with the SSPS are reviewed: the finite element, absolute nodal coordinate, floating frame formulation, and structure-preserving methods. Both the merits and shortcomings of the above four approaches are introduced when they are employed in dynamic problems associated with the SSPS. Synthesizing the merits of the aforementioned four approaches, we believe that embedding the structure-preserving method into finite element software may be an effective way to perform a numerical analysis of the dynamic problems associated with the SSPS.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

The radiated massive primary was the Sun, and each planet in the solar system could be considered an oblate secondary. Because the problem has no closed-form solution, numerical methods were employed. Nevertheless, the general response of the problem could be non-periodic or periodic, which is significantly depended on the initial conditions of the orbit-attitude states. Therefore, the simultaneous orbit and attitude initial states correction (SOAISC) algorithm was introduced to achieve precise initial conditions. On the other side, the conventional initial guess vector was essential as the input of the correction algorithm and increased the probability of reaching more precise initial conditions. Thus, a new practical approach was developed in the form of an orbital correction algorithm to obtain the initial conditions for the periodic orbit of the P-CRTBP. This new proposed algorithm may be distinguished from previously presented orbital correction algorithms by its ability to propagate the P-CRTBP family orbits around the Lagrangian points using only one of the periodic orbits of the unperturbed CRTBP (U-CRTBP). In addition, the Poincaré map and Floquet theory search methods were used to recognize the various initial guesses for attitude parameters. Each of these search methods was able to identify different initial guesses for attitude states. Moreover, as a new innovation, these search methods were applied as a powerful tool to select the appropriate inertia ratio for a satellite to deliver periodic responses from the coupled model. Adding the mentioned perturbations to the U-CRTBP could lead to the more accurate modeling of the examination environment and a better understanding of a spacecraft’s natural motion. A comparison between the orbit-attitude natural motions in the unperturbed and perturbed models was also conducted to show this claim.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

Given that there are several special advantages of space relative navigation using angles-only measurements from passive optical sensors, angles-only relative navigation is considered as one of the best potential approaches in the field of space relative navigation. However, angles-only relative navigation is well-known for its range observability problem. To overcome this observability problem, many studies have been conducted over the past decades. In this study, we present a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art space relative navigation based on angles-only measurements. The emphasis is on the observability problem and solutions to angles-only relative navigation, where the review of the solutions is categorized into four classes based on the intrinsic principle: complicated dynamics approach, multi-line of sight (multi-LOS) approach, sensor offset center-of-mass approach, and orbit maneuver approach. Then, the flight demonstration results of angles-only relative navigation in the two projects are briefly reviewed. Finally, conclusions of this study and recommendations for further research are presented.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

Herein, an angles-only navigation algorithm with multisensor data fusion is proposed to derive the relative motion states between two noncooperative spacecraft. First, the design model of the proposed algorithm is introduced, including the derivation of the state propagation and measurement equations. Subsequently, models for the sensor and actuator are introduced, and the effects of various factors on the sensors and actuators are considered. The square-root unscented Kalman filter is used to design the angles-only navigation filtering scheme. Additionally, the Clohessy—Wiltshire terminal guidance algorithm is introduced to obtain the theoretical relative motion trajectories during the rendezvous operations of two noncooperative spacecraft. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed angles-only navigation algorithm is verified using a semi-physical simulation platform. The results prove that an optical navigation camera combined with average accelerometers and occasional orbital maneuvers is feasible for spacecraft noncooperative rendezvous using angles-only navigation.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

This is analyzed in this work with a novel method that combines the definition of a suitable homotopy with a classical perturbation approach, in which the low thrust is assumed to be a perturbation of the nominal Keplerian motion. The homotopy perturbation method provides the analytical (approximate) solution of the dynamical equations in polar form to estimate the corresponding spacecraft propelled trajectory with a short computational time.

To deal with this issue, a feasible attitude trajectory generation method is proposed that utilizes a multiresolution technique and local attitude node adjustment to obtain sufficient time and quaternion nodes to satisfy the pointing constraints. These nodes are further used to calculate the continuous attitude trajectory based on quaternion polynomial interpolation and the inverse dynamics method. Then, the characteristic parameters of these nodes are extracted to transform the path-planning problem into a parameter optimization problem aimed at minimizing energy consumption. This problem is solved by an improved hierarchical optimization algorithm, in which an adaptive parameter-tuning mechanism is introduced to improve the performance of the original algorithm. A numerical simulation is performed, and the results confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

A model for void fraction covariance has been developed for large diameter pipes. The newly developed model has been compared with two previously developed models in terms of void fraction prediction accuracy. The effects of these additions on the void fraction prediction uncertainty have been evaluated utilizing a computational tool developed in MATLAB. The results indicate that there are small differences in the void fraction prediction between the models evaluated and the two-fluid model without void fraction covariance. Higher void fractions above 0.7 show the most significant changes. However, the differences in the uncertainty are not significant when compared to the uncertainty in the data used for the comparison. The results highlight a need for additional data for higher void fractions, collected with steam-water systems in large diameter pipes.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

However, traditional sequential convex optimization algorithms suffer from shortcomings in terms of their poor real-time performance. This work focuses on applying the deep learning-based closed-loop guidance algorithm and error propagation analysis for powered landing, thereby significantly improving the real-time performance. First, a controller consisting of two deep neural networks is constructed to map the thrust direction and magnitude of the rocket according to the state variables. Thereafter, the analytical transition relationships between different uncertainty sources and the state propagation error in a single guidance period are analyzed by adopting linear covariance analysis. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed methods is verified via a comparison with the indirect method and Monte Carlo simulations. Compared with the traditional sequential convex optimization algorithm, our method reduces the computation time from 75 ms to less than 1 ms. Therefore, it shows potential for online applications.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

For some potential missions, the orbits of interest are selected as nearly stable to reduce the possibility of rapid departure. However, the linearly stable nature of these orbits is also a drawback for their timely insertion into or departure from the orbit. Stable or nearly stable near rectilinear halo orbits (NRHOs), distant retrograde orbits (DROs), and lunar orbits offer potential long-horizon trajectories for exploration missions and demand efficient operations. The current investigation focuses on leveraging stretching directions as a tool for departure and trajectory design applications. The magnitude of the state variations along the maximum stretching direction is expected to grow rapidly and, therefore, offers information for efficient departure from the orbit. Similarly, maximum stretching in reverse time enables arrival with a minimal maneuver magnitude.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"
doi:10.1007/s42757-021-0122-3,en,A multiphase approach for pyrolysis modelling of polymeric materials,"['OriginalPaper', 'Research Article']","In this study, a multiphase pyrolysis model has been proposed under the large eddy simulation (LES) framework incorporating moving boundary surface tracking, char formation, and detailed chemical kinetics combustion modelling. The proposed numerical model was applied to simulate the cone calorimeter test of two kinds of materials: (i) pinewood (charring) and (ii) low-density polyethylene (non-charring). Using a cone calorimeter setup, good agreement has been achieved between the computational and the experimental results. The model is capable of predicting the formation of the char layer and thus replicating the flame suppressing thermal and barrier effects. Furthermore, with the application of detailed chemical kinetics, the fire model was able to aptly predict the generation of asphyxiant gas such as CO/CO 2 during the burning process. However, the pinewood experiments showed significant CO/CO 2 emissions post flame extinguishment attributed to char oxidation effects, which were not considered by the fire model. Despite the limitation, the fully coupled LES model proposed in this study was capable of predicting the fluid mechanics and heat transfer for the turbulent reacting flow, solid-phase decomposition, and gaseous products under flaming conditions. In the future, it can be further extended to include char oxidation mechanisms to improve predictions for charring materials.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

Examples refer to coastal engineering applications as well as geotechnical or biomedical applications. Albeit the frequent applications, slight inconsistencies in the formulation of the governing equations can be found in the literature. The main goal of this paper is to identify these differences and provide a quantitative assessment of different approaches. Following a review of the different formulations, simulation results obtained from three alternative formulations are compared with experimental and numerical data. Results obtained by 2D and 3D test cases indicate that the predictive differences returned by the different formulations remain small for most applications, in particular for small porous Reynolds number Re P < 5000. Thus it seems justified to select a simplified formulation that supports an efficient algorithm and coding structure in a computational fluid dynamics environment. An estimated accuracy depending on the porous Reynolds number or the mean grain diameter is given for the simplified formulation.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

The gradient of the concentration and size of water droplets has been revealed. The results show that the simulation of PBM model is more realistic; the coalescence probability of water droplets is much greater than the fragmentation probability; due to the coalescence behavior of water droplets, the oil—water separation process will be easier; and the separation efficiency will be 1%–2% higher than that of conventional Euler—Euler model.

To better understand the flow behavior, many investigators did measurements, RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes) simulation, and LES (large-eddy simulation) of these types of flows. Most studies were done for weakly swirling gas-particle flows with swirl numbers less than unity. Experimental and numerical studies were done by the present author and his colleagues for PDPA measurements of swirling gas-particle flows with swirl numbers greater than unity, Reynolds-averaged two-fluid (Eulerian-Eulerian) simulation using k-ε-k p and USM (unified second-order moment) two-phase turbulence models, and two-fluid LES using a two-phase sub-grid stress model. The measurement and simulation results give the two-phase time-averaged and RMS fluctuation velocities, and particle concentration distribution, showing the complex recirculation structures in the two-phase axial velocities and the Rankine-vortex structures in the two-phase tangential velocities, the anisotropic two-phase turbulence properties, and the effect of swirl number on the two-phase flow behavior.

This may lead to overestimation of the CO 2 emissions from SOC decomposition. In calcareous soils, there is a chemical balance between precipitation and dissolution of CaCO 3 -CO 2 -HCO 3 − , which is affected by soil environmental factors (moisture, temperature, pH and depth), root growth (rhizosphere effect) and agricultural measures (organic materials input, nitrogen fertilization and straw removal). In this paper, we first introduced the contribution of SIC dissolution to CO 2 emissions from calcareous soils and their driving factors. Second, we reviewed the methods to distinguish two CO 2 sources released from calcareous soils and quantify the 13 C fractionation coefficient between SIC and SIC-derived CO 2 and between SOC and SOC-derived CO 2 , and to partition three CO 2 sources released from soils with plants and organic materials input. Finally, we proposed methods for accurately distinguishing three CO 2 sources released from calcareous soils. This review helps to improve the accuracy of soil C balance assessment in calcareous soils, and also proposes the direction of further investigations on SIC-derived CO 2 emissions responses to abiotic factors and agricultural measures.","['Environment', 'Soil Science & Conservation', 'Ecology']"

Pb pollution (>300 mg kg −1 ) significantly influenced the diversity and metabolic functions of soil microbial communities.

Among those, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are of concern due to their high environmental persistence, and as they might affect soil structure and function. However, data on impacts of PFAS on soil structure and microbially-driven processes are currently lacking. This study explored the effects of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) at environmental-relevant concentrations on soil health, using a 6-week microcosm experiment. PFAS (even at 0.5 ng g −1 for PFBS) significantly increased litter decomposition, associated with positive effects on β-glucosidase activities. This effect increased with PFAS concentrations. Soil pH was significantly increased, likely as a direct consequence of increased litter decomposition affected by PFAS. Soil respiration was significantly inhibited by PFAS in week 3, while this effect was more variable in week 6. Water-stable aggregates were negatively affected by PFOS, possibly related to microbial shifts. PFAS affected soil bacterial and fungal abundance, but not microbial and certain enzyme activities. Our work highlights the potential effects of PFAS on soil health, and we argue that this substance class could be a factor of environmental change of potentially broad relevance in terrestrial ecosystem functioning.","['Environment', 'Soil Science & Conservation', 'Ecology']"

However, the influence of fertilizer and weed species richness interaction is unclear. Nematode abundance and biodiversity in wheat and weed plots soil treated with nitrogen, phosphate and potassium fertilizer addition and weed species richness (0, 1, 2 and 4 weed levels) were investigated in a long-term microcosm experiment established in 2010 at Kaifeng, China. The results demonstrated that fertilizer treatment increased the abundance of total nematode, bacterivores, and plant parasites whereas it decreased the total genera number, the Shannon—Wiener diversity index (H′), Margalef richness index (SR), the total maturity index (ΣMI), and structure index (SI), and degraded the structure of the nematode community. In contrast, weed species richness increased these ecological indices and enhanced the structure of the nematode community. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the fertilizer’s effect was more significant than weed species richness. Redundancy analysis (RDA) demonstrated that fertilizer affected soil nematode mainly through increasing soil available phosphorus by 4.71 times and ammonium nitrogen content by 74.03%; weed species richness increased the diversity indices of soil nematode mainly through enhancing soil moisture by 2.07%.

In particular, an encoder—decoder network is utilized to detect specular highlights, and then a novel Unet-Transformer network performs highlight removal; we append transformer modules instead of feature maps in the Unet architecture. We also introduce a highlight detection module as a mask to guide the removal task. Thus, these two networks can be jointly trained in an effective manner. Thanks to the hierarchical and global properties of the transformer mechanism, our framework is able to establish relationships between continuous self-attention layers, making it possible to directly model the mapping between the diffuse area and the specular highlight area, and reduce indeterminacy within areas containing strong specular highlight reflection. Experiments on public benchmark and real-world images demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both highlight detection and removal tasks.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

A greenhouse study was conducted in which flue gas desulfurization gypsum (FGDG) was applied by using different application methods and rates to two agricultural soils. Phosphorus fertilizer was incorporated into the soils at 2.95 g kg −1 to simulate soil with high P levels. The FGDG was then applied at amounts of 0, 1.5, and 15 g kg −1 soil on either the soil surface or mixed throughout the soil samples to simulate no-tillage and tillage, respectively. Ryegrass was planted after treatment application. The study showed that FGDG reduced runoff DP loss by 33% and leachate DP loss 38% in silt loam soil, and runoff DP loss 46% and leachate DP loss 14% in clay loam soil, at the treatment of 15 g kg − 1 FGDG. Mixing applied method (tillage) provided strong interaction with higher FGDG. To overall effect, the mixing-applied method performed better in controlling DP loss from silt loam soil, while surface-applied (no tillage) showed its advantage in controlling DP loss from clay loam soil. In practice it is necessary to optimize FGDG concentrations, application methods, and DP sources (runoff or leachate) to get maximized benefits of FGDG application. The FGDG application had no negative effects on the soil and ryegrass.","['Environment', 'Soil Science & Conservation', 'Ecology']"

Various geophysical processes have modified these regolith layers since their origin. Therefore, the landforms on regolith-blanketed surfaces hold vital clues for reconstructing the geological processes occurring on small bodies. However, the mechanical strength of small body regolith remains unclear, which is an important parameter for understanding its dynamic evolution. Furthermore, regolith mechanical properties are key factors for the design and operation of space missions that interact with small body surfaces. The granular penetrometer, which is an instrument that facilitates in situ mechanical characterization of surface/subsurface materials, has attracted significant attention. However, we still do not fully understand the penetration dynamics related to granular regolith, partially because of the experimental difficulties in measuring grain-scale responses under microgravity, particularly on the longer timescales of small body dynamics. In this study, we analyzed the slow intrusion of a locomotor into granular matter through large-scale numerical simulations based on a soft sphere discrete element model. We demonstrated that the resistance force of cohesionless regolith increases abruptly with penetration depth after contact and then transitions to a linear regime. The scale factor of the steady-state component is roughly proportional to the internal friction of the granular materials, which allows us to deduce the shear strength of planetary soils by measuring their force-depth relationships. When cohesion is included, due to the brittle behavior of cohesive materials, the resistance profile is characterized by a stationary state at a large penetration depth. The saturation resistance, which represents the failure threshold of granular materials, increases with the cohesion strength of the regolith. This positive correlation provides a reliable tool for measuring the tensile strength of granular regolith in small body touchdown missions.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

However, the recovery outcomes of different areas with the same vegetation assemblage pattern are completely different after long-term evolution. Therefore, understanding the causes of differential vegetation recovery and the mechanism of plant succession is of great significance to the ecological restoration of mines. Three Pinus tabulaeformis plantations with similar initial site conditions and restoration measures but with different secondary succession processes were selected from the open-pit coal mine dump that has been restored for 30 years. Soil physicochemical properties, enzyme activities, vegetation and microbial features were investigated, while the structural equation models were established to explore the interactions between plants, soil and microbes. The results showed that original vegetation configuration and soil nutrient conditions were altered due to secondary succession. With the advancement of the secondary succession process, the coverage of plants increased from 34.8% to 95.5% ( P < 0.05), soil organic matter increased from 9.30 g kg −1 to 21.13 g kg −1 ( P < 0.05), and total nitrogen increased from 0.38 g kg −1 to 1.01 g kg −1 ( P < 0.05). The activities of soil urease and β-glucosidase were increased by 1.7-fold and 53.26%, respectively. Besides, the secondary succession also changed the soil microbial community structure and function. The relative abundance of Nitrospira genus which dominates the nitrification increased 5.2-fold.

A 42-day of microcosm incubation was conducted with two soils: a natural watermelon Fusarium wilt pathogen (i.e., Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (FON))-infested soil (Low-FON soil) and the soil further receiving the wilt pathogen inocula (High-FON soil). Both soils were supplemented with four simple sugars before incubation. The results show that, in both soils, FON was enriched by all sugars although co-living with tremendously diverse microbes; and bacterial richness, evenness, and diversity were decreased and bacterial community structure was changed by all sugars. Bacterial richness and evenness were negatively correlated with FON quantity in both Low-FON and High-FON soils, indicating that FON may tend to live in soil with low alpha-diversity. In both Low-FON and High-FON soils, the sugar-spiked networks had more links, higher density, larger modules, and shorter harmonic geodesic distance, suggesting greater potentials for microbial interaction and niche-sharing. The positive links between some of the keystone taxa and FON indicates that these keystone taxa may have promoted FON. This may be one of reasons why FON could proliferate vigorously after sugar supplementation.","['Environment', 'Soil Science & Conservation', 'Ecology']"

The requirements for the safety margin for advanced small modular reactor (SMR) systems are targeted even higher than the conventional commercial large-scale nuclear reactors incorporating the passive and inherent safety systems. The SMR systems are designed with the condensation passive containment cooling system (PCCS), which plays a critical role in removing reactor heat during a steam release accident case. However, the presence of non-condensable gas (NCG), like air, reduces the heat transfer performance. This physics phenomenon becomes multifactorial for nuclear reactor containment during a fuel failure accident case that releases hydrogen gas. Besides, the mixture component of steam-air-hydrogen varies in reactor accident cases, which needs simulation and validation keeping parameters of importance. Reviews showed that previous studies for SMR’s PCCS did not cover the condensation heat transfer (CHT) in the presence of multicomponent NCG mixture parametric computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation and validation, making a research gap in the SMR design safety. A comprehensive CHT parametric CFD study was performed for SMR PCCS to fill this research gap. This study used experimental data as simulation 3D physics domain inlet and outlet boundary conditions. However, the wall boundary conditions were constant temperature, curve-fit, and annular coolant for verifying the turbulence models. Parametric simulations were performed, verified, and optimized for steam-NCG mixtures. The multicomponent gases, multiphase mixtures, and fluid film condensation models were applied with associated turbulence models. The results of the parametric study were evaluated for realistic reactor conditions. Results showed that parametric study provided critical insight about the dependency of multicomponent gas mixture parameters that supports reactor safety design, analysis, and licensing.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

Our key observation is that to recover the underlying structures as well as surface details, given partial input, a fundamental component is a good feature representation that can capture both global structure and local geometric details. We accordingly first propose FSNet, a feature structuring module that can adaptively aggregate point-wise features into a 2D structured feature map by learning multiple latent patterns from local regions. We then integrate FSNet into a coarse-to-fine pipeline for point cloud completion. Specifically, a 2D convolutional neural network is adopted to decode feature maps from FSNet into a coarse and complete point cloud. Next, a point cloud upsampling network is used to generate a dense point cloud from the partial input and the coarse intermediate output. To efficiently exploit local structures and enhance point distribution uniformity, we propose IFNet, a point upsampling module with a self-correction mechanism that can progressively refine details of the generated dense point cloud.

However, the spatial distribution and the activity-density of termites on a fine-scale in tropical forests are still unknown. We checked the spatial distribution patterns of the feeding groups and species of termites and their co-occurrence pattern in a 1-ha (100 m × 100 m) plot, and their correlation with the environmental factors. We used a standard protocol to collect termite assemblages and classified them into five feeding groups based on their preferred diet: fungus growers, litter feeders, soil feeders, soil-wood feeders, and wood feeders. We measured the environmental factors: soil pH, litter mass, aboveground plant biomass, and topographic position index (TPI). Soil-wood feeders showed the highest activity-density, followed by wood feeders, fungus growers, soil feeders, and litter feeders. Soil-wood feeders and fungus growers demonstated a strong correlation while litter feeders showed weak correlations with other feeding groups. Termite feeding groups and most of the termite species displayed a positive association with the high TPI and the low soil pH patches.

First, the landmarks on the asteroid surface and markers on the lander were identified from the images acquired by the orbiter. Subsequently, an angles-only measurement model concerning the landmarks and markers was constructed to estimate the orbiter’s position and lander’s pose.

Additionally, some specific template feature samples are generated using the motion constraints for correlation filter learning, which is beneficial for training a scale and feature distortion adaptive correlation filter for accurate feature matching.

Combination of both joint lubrication and drug intervention may provide a promising nonsurgical strategy for treatment of OA. Developing novel and simple approaches to fabricate superlubricating nanoparticles with drug release property is highly required. Herein, dopamine triggered one-step polymerization method was employed to fabricate polydopamine/poly(3-sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium salt) (PDA—PSPMA) conjugate coating on hollow silica (h-SiO 2 ) nanosphere surfaces to engineer functional nanoparticles (h-SiO 2 /PDA—PSPMA). The as-prepared h-SiO 2 /PDA—PSPMA exhibits excellent aqueous lubrication performance on biomaterial substrates as well as natural bovine articular cartilage based on hydration effect of negatively charged PDA—PSPMA coating and “rolling” effect of h-SiO 2 nanospheres. In vitro drug loading-release experiments demonstrate that PDA—PSPMA coating functionalized h-SiO 2 nanospheres show high drug-loading and sustained-release capability of an anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac sodium (DS). Such h-SiO 2 /PDA—PSPMA nanospheres can be potentially used as a synergistic therapy agent for OA treatment combining by simultaneous joint lubrication and drug release.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

In this study, a new MEN system TiNbWN, forming a single fcc solution, is designed and its wear performance at temperatures ranging from 25 to 750 °C is explored. The wear mechanisms can be rationalized by examining the subsurface microstructural evolutions using the transmission electron microscopy as well as calculating the phase diagrams and interfacial adhesion behavior employing calculation of phase diagram (CALPHAD) and density functional theory (DFT). To be specific, increased wear losses occur in a temperature range of 25–600 °C, being predominantly caused by the thermally-induced hardness degradation; whereas at the ultimate temperature (750 °C), the wear loss is refrained due to the formation of nanocrystalline oxides (W n O 3 n −2 , TiO 2 , and γ TiO x ), as synergistically revealed by microscopy and CALPHAD, which not only enhance the mechanical properties of the pristine nitride film, but also act as solid lubricants, reducing the interfacial adhesion. Thus, our work delineates the role of the in situ formed nanocrystalline oxides in the wear mechanism transition of TiNbWN thin films, which could shed light on the high-temperature wear behavior of refractory HEN/MEN films.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

During this, the adhesive flows in such a way that, ideally, it completely fills the joint. In practice, however, areas with entrapped air frequently remain in the bonded adhesive layer. Within the scope of a research project, these flows are systematically analyzed in order to identify optimal initial application patterns for the adhesive and substrate geometry to minimise such risks. For this purpose, the authors use an efficient flow model, the partially filled gaps model (PFGM), extended in this study to include the functionality of trapped air pockets. Depending on the volume fractions of air and adhesive, the flow of both phases is computed. Therefore, the model is introduced and fully described, benchmarked with respect to its plausibility and functionality, and results obtained are compared with a CFD calculation. Thereafter, the functionality of openings and closings of the pockets are analyzed. Lastly, the model is then applied to a real scenario created with a Hele–Shaw cell measurement.

In this work, the frictional properties of phthalocyanine self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with face-on (aromatic cores parallel to the substrate) and edge-on (aromatic cores stand on the substrate) orientations have been compared and the in situ structural variation of edge-on SAMs under frictional shear has been revealed by atomic force microscope (AFM). Face-on oriented SAMs show lower adhesion, lower friction, and stronger wear resistance, compared with edge-on oriented SAMs. Hierarchical structures of edge-on oriented SAMs have been revealed by frictional topography, which are consisted of nanoscale columns, micron-scale stripes, and centimeter-scale monolayer. The column structure deforms under increasing load force, leading to a stepwise friction force curve and a transition among three friction states (ordered friction, collapsed friction, and worn friction). The structural deformation depends on both the order degree and anisotropic stiffness of columns. Columns in phthalocyanine SAMs show a larger stiffness when shearing against molecular plane than shearing along the molecular plane. The presented study on the interfacial structure and frictional mechanism promisingly supports the designing of novel boundary lubricants and their application in engineering.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

The maximal contact pressure in the superlubricity state could reach 1.42 GPa, which far exceeds the limit of the superlubricity regime in previous studies. The results indicate that a composite tribofilm (mainly containing molybdenum oxide and phosphorus oxide) that formed at the interface by a tribochemical reaction contributed to the excellent antiwear performance. Furthermore, the extremely low shear strength of the tribofilm and the interlayers of Mo 2 CT x MXene contributed to the superlubricity. This work demonstrates the promising potential of Mo 2 CT x MXene in improving superlubricity properties, which could accelerate the application of superlubricity in mechanical systems.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

Based on the phase space structure in the Sun–Earth circular restricted three-body problem, we find that the surface of 2016 HO 3 in the torus space is a compound surface formed by QS and HS portions. Its co-orbital motion is therefore a QS–HS transition. 2016 HO 3 is currently located in a QS state, and its locus clings to the QS portion in the isosurface in agreement with the semi-analytical results. We provide a criterion to separate the QS and HS stages in the transition and obtain accurate incoming and outgoing epochs of the QS motion. We then propose an approximate curve to describe the locus of 2016 HO 3 in the ω − e projection. Virtual asteroids (VAs) near 2016 HO 3 in the isosurface were created to study the influence of the initial state of the QS–HS transition. We find that the duration of the QS state is mainly influenced by the loci in the ω − e projection. The VAs with large QS durations usually have longer loci across the QS region than those with shorter durations. In addition, although some VAs are close to 2016 HO 3 in the ω − e projection, their co-orbital behaviors are significantly different from that of the latter. This indicates that the QS–HS transition of 2016 HO 3 is sensitive to the ( ω , e ) position.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

In this study, the past experimental studies performed in the gas-liquid metal two-phase flow are reviewed, and the void fraction and interfacial area concentration (IAC) database taken in the N 2 -Pb/Bi (nitrogen and lead/bismuth eutectic alloy) two-phase flow in a vertical circular flow channel are collected. In order to obtain the flow characteristics of the gas-liquid metal two-phase flow, the experimental data of the N 2 -Pb/Bi two-phase flow are compared with experimental data of the air-water two-phase flow. The void fraction gradient along the height (namely the flow direction) and the bubble diameter in the N 2 -Pb/Bi two-phase flow are found to be much larger than those in the air-water two-phase flow. These two unique flow characteristics can be explained, respectively, by the large density and surface tension of the Pb/Bi eutectic alloy in the N 2 -Pb/Bi two-phase flow. This study also reviewed the available IAC correlations and found that so far no IAC correlation has been developed for the gas-liquid metal two-phase flow. So, the available major IAC correlations for air- and steam-water two-phase flows are collected and compared with the collected experimental data of the N 2 -Pb/Bi two-phase flow. The comparison shows that these IAC correlations cannot give reliable predictions for the experimental data of the N 2 -Pb/Bi two-phase flow. So, a new IAC correlation has been developed based on the experimental data of the N 2 -Pb/Bi two-phase flow by taking into account the properties and flow characteristics of the two phases. The newly-developed IAC correlation can satisfactorily predict the experimental data of the N 2 -Pb/Bi two-phase flow with the mean relative error of 0.0609.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

This paper aims to use edge-tailored guide vanes to ease flow transition and improve flow efficiency, numerically.

Sensitivity studies were performed on the influence of number of guide vane and guide vane thickness in a 45° pipe elbow. In setting up the numerical model for the assumed two-phase flow system (crude oil and water), the volume of fluid model was activated to model time-dependent fluctuations of each interacting phase volume fraction throughout the flow period. Furthermore, the improved delayed detached-eddy simulation turbulence model is employed to resolve the flow features in and outside the wall boundary layer. From the findings, an improvement in flow performance was witnessed using guide vanes. Furthermore, three thin and non-contacting guide vanes were strategically positioned at the center and towards the circumference of the pipe within the bend area, causing an increase in flow efficiency by 78.87%. In addition, the guide vanes played a significant role in limiting turbulence effect to effective flow of the primary phase.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

Although suppression behaviours between hydrocarbon-fuelled fire and water-based suppression agents were extensively studied both numerically and experimentally, lack of numerical studies was conducted on fires involving water-reactive chemicals (i.e., Na, Li, and LiH), where extinguishment is barely performed by water-based active suppression system, as violent and explosive decomposition occurred between water and reactive fuel. In this research, a numerical investigation has been conducted on expandable graphite (EG) application for water-reactive fire suppression. Based on the discrete phase model (DPM) framework, a novel EG particle model is proposed to characterise the particle expansion that couples with superior thermal properties and chemical stability. A numerical assessment on large eddy simulation (LES) has been performed to study the temporal fire behaviours and the suppression effect of EG against the flame plume in various subgrid-scale (SGS) models. Four SGS models were adopted, which were namely Smagorinsky-Lilly, WALE, dynamic kinetic energy, and dynamic Smagorinsky-Lilly. As a result, the WALE SGS model was observed to be in a better agreement compared with the experimental data owing to its significant enhancement in flow diffusivity modelling.

Their effectiveness depends on their interactions with rubbing surfaces and may be mitigated by the choice of the base fluid. In this work, the performance of an imidazolium ionic liquid (ImIL) additive in polyethylene-glycol (PEG) and 1,4-butanediol for lubricating steel/steel and diamond-like-carbon/diamond-like carbon (DLC—DLC) contacts were investigated. ImIL-containing PEG reduces friction more effectively in steel—steel than DLC—DLC contacts. In contrast, adding ImIL in 1,4-butanediol results in an increase in friction in steel—steel contacts. Results from the Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and focused ion beam-transmission electron microscopy (FIB-TEM) reveal that a surface film is formed on steel during rubbing in ImIL-containing PEG. This film consists of two layers. The top layer is composed of amorphous carbon and are easily removed during rubbing. The bottom layer, which contains iron oxide and nitride compound, adheres strongly on the steel surface. This film maintains its effectiveness in a steel—steel contact even after ImIL additives are depleted. Such film is not observed in 1,4-butanediol where the adsorption of ImIL is hindered, as suggested by the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements. No benefit is observed when the base fluid on its own is sufficiently lubricious, as in the case of DLC surfaces. This work provides fundamental insights on how compatibilities among base fluid, FM, and rubbing surface affect the performance of IL as surface active additives. It reveals the structure of an ionic liquid (IL) surface film, which is effective and durable. The knowledge is useful for guiding future IL additive development.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

It plays a crucial role in runoff regulation. Investigations on the mechanisms of water and heat exchanges are necessary to understand the land surface processes over the alpine wetland. This study explores the characteristics of hydro-meteorological factors with in situ observations and uses the Community Land Model 5 to identify the main factors controlling water and heat exchanges. Latent heat flux and thermal roughness length were found to be greater in the warm season (June–August) than in the cold season (December–February), with a frozen depth of 20–40 cm over the alpine wetland. The transfers of heat fluxes were mainly controlled by longwave radiation and air temperature and affected by root distribution. Air pressure and stomatal conductance were also important to latent heat flux, and soil solid water content was important to sensible heat flux. Soil temperature was dominated by longwave radiation and air temperature, with crucial surface parameters of initial soil liquid water content and total water content. The atmospheric control factors transitioned to precipitation and air temperature for soil moisture, especially at the shallow layer (5 cm). Meanwhile, the more influential surface parameters were root distribution and stomatal conductance in the warm season and initial soil liquid water content and total water content in the cold season.

doi:10.1007/s00376-022-1445-3,en,A New Sensitivity Analysis Approach Using Conditional Nonlinear Optimal Perturbations and Its Preliminary Application,"['OriginalPaper', 'Original Paper']","Simulations and predictions using numerical models show considerable uncertainties, and parameter uncertainty is one of the most important sources. It is impractical to improve the simulation and prediction abilities by reducing the uncertainties of all parameters. Therefore, identifying the sensitive parameters or parameter combinations is crucial. This study proposes a novel approach: conditional nonlinear optimal perturbations sensitivity analysis (CNOPSA) method. The CNOPSA method fully considers the nonlinear synergistic effects of parameters in the whole parameter space and quantitatively estimates the maximum effects of parameter uncertainties, prone to extreme events. Results of the analytical g-function test indicate that the CNOPSA method can effectively identify the sensitivity of variables. Numerical results of the theoretical five-variable grassland ecosystem model show that the maximum influence of the simulated wilted biomass caused by parameter uncertainty can be estimated and computed by employing the CNOPSA method. The identified sensitive parameters can easily change the simulation or prediction of the wilted biomass, which affects the transformation of the grassland state in the grassland ecosystem. The variance-based approach may underestimate the parameter sensitivity because it only considers the influence of limited parameter samples from a statistical view. This study verifies that the CNOPSA method is effective and feasible for exploring the important and sensitive physical parameters or parameter combinations in numerical models. 数值模式中物理参数的不确定性是数值模拟和预测不确定性的重要来源之一。由于数值模式中包含大量的物理过程和参数，通过减少所有物理参数的不确定性以提高数值模式的模拟能力和预测技巧将花费大量的人力和物力。因此，识别敏感的参数或参数组合至关重要。本研究提出了一种识别物理参数敏感性的新方法：条件非线性最优扰动敏感性分析（CNOPSA）方法。该方法克服了传统方法的局限性，在参数不确定性范围内充分考虑了物理参数间的非线性协同效应，可识别出相对敏感和重要的物理参数和参数组合，并定量估计出由物理参数变化导致的数值模拟和预测不确定性的最大程度，因而适用于对极端事件的研究。 利用理论的g-函数和五变量草原生态系统模型检验了CNOPSA方法的可行性和有效性，结果表明CNOPSA方法可以有效地识别物理变量和物理参数的敏感性。本文进一步利用该方法，定量地估计了由物理参数不确定性导致的该草原生态系统模型中枯草量模拟和预测不确定性的最大程度，识别出的敏感参数的变化易使得草原生态系统发生突变。然而，基于方差分析的参数敏感性分析方法，仅从统计的角度考虑有限的参数样本，易低估物理参数的敏感性。","['Earth Sciences', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Meteorology', 'Geophysics/Geodesy']"

A positive correlation between the warming and thermal degradation in permafrost or seasonally frozen ground (SFG) has long been recognized. Still, a predictive relationship between historical wetting under warming climate conditions and frozen ground has not yet been well demonstrated, despite the expectation that it will become even more important because precipitation over the QTP has been projected to increase continuously in the near future. This study investigates the response of the thermal regime to historical wetting in both permafrost and SFG areas and examines their relationships separately using the Community Land Surface Model version 4.5. Results show that wetting before the 1990s across the QTP mainly cooled the permafrost body in the arid and semiarid zones, with significant correlation coefficients of 0.60 and 0.48, respectively. Precipitation increased continually at the rate of 6.16 mm decade −1 in the arid zone after the 1990s but had a contrasting warming effect on permafrost through a significant shortening of the thawing duration within the active layer. However, diminished rainfall in the humid zone after the 1990s also significantly extended the thawing duration of SFG. The relationship between the ground thawing index and precipitation was significantly negatively correlated (−0.75). The dual effects of wetting on the thermal dynamics of the QTP are becoming critical because of the projected increases in future precipitation. 自20世纪90年代以来,青藏高原经历了明显的增温变湿过程,这显著地改变了冻土的水热属性。气候增温与高原冻土热退化间的正相关关系目前已经被广泛认知,然而,历史时期高原变湿事实与冻土热状况变化之间的预测关系尚未建立。随着未来高原湿化过程的持续,气候变暖背景下高原降水量的增加对冻土热动力的影响将日益增强。本文使用陆面过程模式CLM4.5,模拟了高原增暖变湿过程中各气候区域土壤冻融指数的变化,计算了多年冻土和季节性冻土区冻融指数与降水量的相关系数, 探讨了不同冻土类型对降水量异常的热响应差异。结果表明,20世纪90年代之前,高原降水量的增加主要对多年冻土产生冷却效应:干旱区和半干旱区的变湿过程分别显著延长了活动层内的冻结时长及消融时长,相关系数分别为0.60和0.48；20世纪90年代后,高原降水量增加的空间差异性逐渐增强。干旱区的降水量持续增加（6.16 毫米/10年）,充足的降水对多年冻土起到了相反的暖化作用,具体表现为活动层内消融指数的显著减小,冻土消融期缩短；而湿润区的降水量呈下降趋势（20.10 毫米/10年）,这对季节性冻土的消融期的延长产生了显著地影响,相关系数为0.75。随着未来青藏高原湿化过程的加剧,降水量的增加对冻土热动态的双重影响将会变得至关重要。","['Earth Sciences', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Meteorology', 'Geophysics/Geodesy']"

Accordingly, various indices have been introduced to identify the SCSSM onset date. However, the onset dates as determined by various indices can be very inconsistent. It not only limits the determination of onset dates but also misleads the assessment of prediction skills. In 2021, the onset time as identified by the circulation criteria was 20 May, which is 12 days earlier than that deduced by also considering the convection criteria. The present study mainly ascribes such circulation-convection inconsistency to the activities of tropical cyclones (TCs) modulated by the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). The convection of TC “Yaas” (2021) acted as an upper-level diabatic heat source to the north of the SCS, facilitating the circulation transition. Afterward, TC “Cho-wan” (2021) over the western Pacific aided the westerlies to persist at lower levels while simultaneously suppressing moist convection over the SCS. Accurate predictions using the ECMWF S2S forecast system were obtained only after the MJO formation. The skillful prediction of the MJO during late spring may provide an opportunity to accurately predict the establishment of the SCSSM several weeks in advance. 南海夏季风爆发以显著的季节性环流与对流转换为特征。根据此，很多指标已经被提出用于定义南海夏季风爆发的日期。然而，根据不同指数决定的爆发日期可能非常不一致。这不仅限制了爆发日期的确定，而且会误导预报技巧的评估。在2021年，根据环流标准定义的爆发日期为5月20日，与考虑了对流标准推演得到的爆发日期相比提早了12天。本文主要将这样环流-对流不一致的现象归因于由MJO (Madden-Julian Oscillation) 引发的台风。热带气旋“Yass”作为南海北部高层非绝热加热的热源，加速了环流的转换。此后，西太平洋上空的热带气旋“Choi-wan”协助低层西风的持续，但同时也抑制了南海上空的湿对流。使用ECMWF的季节-次季节预报系统仅仅在得到MJO信息之后可以准确预报2021年南海夏季风爆发。在晚春时期MJO预报技巧的提高，可能会为提前几周准确预报南海夏季风的建立提供一个机会窗口。","['Earth Sciences', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Meteorology', 'Geophysics/Geodesy']"

Six simulations are run for the Chinese mainland on 0.1° × 0.1° grids from 1979 to 2008, and the simulated monthly soil moisture (SM), evapotranspiration (ET), and snow depth (SD) are then compared and assessed against observations. The results show that the meteorological forcing is the most important factor governing output. Beyond that, SM seems to be also very sensitive to soil texture information; SD is also very sensitive to snow parameterization scheme in the LSM. The Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5), driven by newly developed observation-based regional meteorological forcing and land surface parameters (referred to as CMFD_CLM4.5_NEW), significantly improved the simulations in most cases over the Chinese mainland and its eight basins. It increased the correlation coefficient values from 0.46 to 0.54 for the SM modeling and from 0.54 to 0.67 for the SD simulations, and it decreased the root-mean-square error (RMSE) from 0.093 to 0.085 for the SM simulation and reduced the normalized RMSE from 1.277 to 0.201 for the SD simulations. This study indicates that the offline LSM simulation using a refined LSM driven by newly developed observation-based regional meteorological forcing and land surface parameters can better model reginal land surface hydrological processes. 本文利用不同模式参数化方案、气象强迫和地表参数设计了六个模拟试验，并与观测进行对比分析，揭示了影响中国区域陆面水文要素（土壤湿度、蒸散发和雪深等）模拟的主要因子。结果表明，气象强迫是陆面水文过程模拟的主要影响因子，土壤湿度和雪深的模拟分别与土壤质地信息和陆面模式参数化方案紧密相关。利用新发展的融合观测信息的中国区域气象强迫和地表参数信息驱动陆面模式模拟，显著提高了中国大部分区域陆面水文过程模拟精度，并减少了模拟的不确定性。土壤湿度模拟与观测的相关系数从0.46提高到0.54，雪深模拟与观测的相关系数从0.54提高到0.67；土壤湿度模拟与观测的均方根误差从0.093降低到0.085，雪深模拟与观测的均方根误差从1.277降低到0.201。","['Earth Sciences', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Meteorology', 'Geophysics/Geodesy']"

doi:10.1007/s00376-022-2164-5,en,A Quantitative Method of Detecting Transient Rossby Wave Phase Speed: No Evidence of Slowing Down with Global Warming,"['OriginalPaper', 'Original Paper']","Based on the Complex Empirical Orthogonal Functions (CEOFs) of bandpass-filtered daily streamfunction fields, a quantitative method of detecting transient (synoptic) Rossby wave phase speed (RWPhS) is presented. The transient RWPhS can be objectively calculated by the distance between a high (or low) center in the real part of a CEOF mode and its counterpart in the imaginary part of the same CEOF mode divided by the time span between two adjacent peaks (or bottoms) of two principal component curves for the real and imaginary parts of that CEOF mode. The new detection method may partly reveal the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of Rossby wave prorogation. Although the mean westerly jet at 200 hPa doubles the speed of its counterpart at 500 hPa, the estimated RWPhS at both levels are around 1000 km d −1 and quantitatively consistent with the quasigeostrophic-theory-based RWPhS, confirming that the meridional potential vorticity gradient induced by the barotropic and baroclinic shears of mean flow, together with the β effect, play an essential role in Rossby wave propagation. Both observations over the past four decades and a 150-year historical simulation suggest no evidence for slowing wintertime transient Rossby waves in the Northern Hemisphere, but possible regional changes are not excluded. We emphasize that not only the mean flow speed, but also the barotropic and baroclinic shears of the mean flow, and their associated contributions to the meridional potential vorticity (PV) gradient, should be considered in investigating the possible change of Rossby waves with global warming. 本文提出了一种定量计算瞬变罗斯贝波相速度（RWPhS）的方法。该方法通过对带通滤波处理后的流函数场做复经验正交函数（CEOF）分解得到CEOF 实部和虚部异常中心对的距离，并将其除以复主分量实部和虚部曲线极值点间隔的时长便得到RWPhS。此方法一定程度上揭示了罗斯贝波传播的时空不均匀性。虽然200 hPa高度上的平均西风急流风速是500 hPa的两倍，但在两个高度上计算得到的RWPhS都约为每天1000 公里，与基于准地转理论得到的RWPhS相一致。这证明了由正压风切变、斜压风切变以及β效应所产生的经向位涡梯度在瞬变罗斯贝波传播中的重要作用。根据40年再分析资料和150年历史模拟结果的计算都说明了北半球冬季瞬变罗斯贝波传播整体上并未减慢，但这并不排除其可能的局地变化。本文强调了在研究罗斯贝波随全球变暖的变化时，除了要考虑平均西风风速变化本身的作用，还应考虑正压风切变和斜压风切变所产生的经向位涡梯度在罗斯贝波传播速度变化中对西风影响的抵消作用。","['Earth Sciences', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Meteorology', 'Geophysics/Geodesy']"

The results show that the dendrites growth zones (DGZs) and needles growth zones (NGZs) mostly contain dendrites (DN) and needles (NE), respectively. Clear σ v zones (1.1 < σ v (m s −1 ) < 1.3 and 0.3 < σ v (m s −1 ) < 0.7 for the DGZ and NGZ, respectively) could be identified in the case studies (27 and 28 February 2016) near altitudes corresponding to temperatures of −15°C and −5°C, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency and mesoscale model reanalysis data. Oblate particles with diverse particle shapes were observed in the DGZ with σ V > 1.2 m s −1 , a differential reflectivity (Z DR ) higher than 0 dB, and a cross-correlation coefficient ( ρ hv ) less than 0.96. In contrast, prolate particles with relatively uniform shapes were observed in the NGZ with σ v < 0.6 m s −1 , a Z DR less than 0 dB, and ρ hv higher than 0.97. The simulation results show that the DN exhibited a larger σ v compared to the NE, and this observed σ v was strongly dependent on the wind fluctuations ( v ’) due to turbulence or wind shear. In contrast, the NE exhibited a significantly small σ v ∼ 0.55 m s −1 , which converges irrespective of v ’. In addition, a strong correlation between the measured σ v values at five radar elevation angles ( θ = 6.2°, 9.1°, 13.1°, 19°, and 80°) and those simulated in this study confirmed the significance of the analysis results. 本文研究了模拟和实测雷达速度谱宽之间的相关性。结果表明,枝状固态水凝物增长区（DGZs）和针状固态水凝物增长区（NGZs）主要分别含有枝状冰晶（DN）和针状冰晶（NE）。 根据日本气象厅和中尺度模式再分析数据,在与-15°C和-5°C温度相对应的高度附近案例（2016年2月27日和28日）的研究中,雷达速度谱宽区（DGZ的雷达速度谱宽范围是1.1 m s –1 至 1.3 m s –1 ,NGZ的雷达速度谱宽范围是0.3 m s –1 至 0.7 m s –1 ）可以被清晰地识别出来。在DGZ中观察到具有不同颗粒形状的扁椭球粒子,其雷达速度谱宽大于1.2 m s –1 ,差分反射率高于0 dB,互相关系数小于0.96。相比之下,在NGZ中,观察到具有相对均匀形状的长椭球粒子,其雷达速度谱宽小于0.6 m s –1 ,差分反射率小于0 dB,互相关系数高于0.97。 模拟结果表明,与NE相比,DN对应着更大的雷达速度谱宽,并且观测到的雷达速度谱宽强烈依赖于湍流或风切变引起的风波动。相比之下,NE表现出明显较小的雷达速度谱宽~ 0.55 m s –1 ,其收敛与风波动无关。此外,在五个雷达仰角（θ=6.2°、9.1°、13.1°、19°和80°）下测得的雷达速度谱宽值与本研究中模拟得到的雷达速度谱宽值之间表现出一种强相关性,印证了分析结果的重要性。","['Earth Sciences', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Meteorology', 'Geophysics/Geodesy']"

To establish a new class of OFMs, we measured the friction and wear properties of N-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-oxyl-4-piperidinyl)dodecaneamide referred to as C 12 Amide-TEMPO. The effect of its head group chemistry, which is characterized by a rigid six-membered ring sandwiched by an amide group and a terminal free oxygen radical, was also investigated with both experiments and quantum mechanical (QM) calculations. The measurement results show that C 12 Amide-TEMPO outperforms the conventional OFMs of glyceryl monooleate (GMO) and stearic acid, particularly for load-carrying capacity, wear reduction, and stability of friction over time. The friction and wear reduction effect of C 12 Amide-TEMPO is also greatly superior to those of C 12 Ester-TEMPO and C 12 Amino-TEMPO, in which ester and amino groups replace the amide group, highlighting the critical role of the amide group. The QM calculation results suggest that, in contrast to C 12 Ester-TEMPO, C 12 Amino-TEMPO, and the conventional OFMs of GMO and stearic acid, C 12 Amide-TEMPO can form effective boundary films on iron oxide surfaces with a unique double-layer structure: a strong surface adsorption layer owing to the chemical interactions of the amide oxygen and free radical with iron oxide surfaces, and an upper layer owing to the interlayer hydrogen-bonding between the amide hydrogen and free radical or between the amide hydrogen and oxygen. Moreover, the intralayer hydrogen-bonding in each of the two layers is also possible. We suggest that in addition to strong surface adsorption, the interlayer and intralayer hydrogen-bonding also increases the strength of the boundary films by enhancing the cohesion strength, thereby resulting in the high tribological performance of C 12 Amide-TEMPO. The findings in this study are expected to provide new hints for the optimal molecular design of OFMs.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

The number of HPCV events showed an upward linear trend, with the highest frequency of occurrence in summer. The most active region of HPCV samples was the Northeast China Plain between 40°–55°N. Most HPCV events lasted 3–5 days and had radii ranging from 250 to 1000 km. The duration of HPCV events with larger sizes was longer. About half of the HPCV events moved into (moved out of) the definition region (35°–60°N, 115°–145°E), and half initiated (dissipated) within the region. The initial position was close to the western boundary of the definition region, and the final position was mainly near the eastern boundary. The locations associated with the precipitation were mostly concentrated within 2000 km southeast of the HPCV systems, and they were farther from the center in the cold season than in the warm season. 东北冷涡(NCCV)是影响东亚地区暴雨的重要环流系统。本文利用美国国家环境预测中心的全球再分析资料(NCEP_FNL)和全球降水测量计划卫星反演的降水数据(GPM_IMERG),建立了一套强降水型东北冷涡(Heavy-Precipitation NCCV, HPCV)的客观识别算法,并对2001–19年共164个HPCV过程的特征进行了分析研究。结果表明,HPCV呈现增加的趋势,且夏季发生频次最高。HPCV主要活动于40°–55° N的东北平原上。大部分HPCV过程的持续时间是3–5天,半径在250–1000 km之间。尺度较大的HPCV过程持续时间也较长。在本文的研究区域(35°–60°N, 115°–145°E)内,55.83% (51.53%)的HPCV过程是移入(移出)的,其余的则是在原地生成(消亡)的。在研究区域内,HPCV过程的初始位置主要在西边界,而结束位置则在东边界附近。强降水主要落在HPCV系统东南方向2000 km的范围内,与暖季相比,冷季强降水落区与HPCV中心的距离更远。","['Earth Sciences', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Meteorology', 'Geophysics/Geodesy']"

The proposed framework consists of an expert module focusing on scenes analysis, a CV module for automatic detection, an evaluation module containing thresholds, and an output module for data analysis. Based on this, the changes in the adoption of different CBR technologies (CBRTs), including light-translucent CBRTs (LT-CBRTs) and non-light-translucent CBRTs (NLT-CBRTs), in 24 villages in southern Hebei were identified from 2007 to 2021. The evolution of CBRTs was featured as an inverse S-curve, and differences were found in their evolution stage, adoption ratio, and development speed for different villages. LT-CBRTs are the dominant type but are being replaced and surpassed by NLT-CBRTs in some villages, characterizing different preferences for the technology type of villages. The proposed research framework provides a reference for the evolution monitoring of vernacular buildings, and the identified evolution laws enable to trace and predict the adoption of different CBRTs in a particular village. This work lays a foundation for future exploration of the occurrence and development mechanism of the CBR phenomenon and provides an important reference for the optimization and promotion of CBRTs.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"

Sensors with accurate and reliable measurements are critical for ensuring the precise indoor thermal demand. Owing to its high calibration accuracy and in-situ effectiveness, a virtual sensor (VS)-assisted Bayesian inference (VS-BI) sensor calibration strategy has been applied for HVACs. However, the application feasibility of this strategy for wider ranges of different sensor types (within-control-loop and out-of-control-loop) with various sensor bias fault amplitudes, and influencing factors that affect the practical in-situ calibration performance are still remained to be explored. Hence, to further validate its in-situ calibration performance and analyze the influencing factors, this study applied the VS-BI strategy in a HVAC system including a chiller plant with air handle unit (AHU) terminal. Three target sensors including air supply (SAT), chilled water supply (CHS) and cooling water return (CWR) temperatures are investigated using introduced sensor bias faults with eight different amplitudes of [−2 °C, +2 °C] with a 0.5 °C interval. Calibration performance is evaluated by considering three influencing factors: (1) performance of different data-driven VSs, (2) the influence of prior standard deviations σ on in-situ sensor calibration and (3) the influence of data quality on in-situ sensor calibration from the perspective of energy conservation and data volumes. After comparison, a long short term memory (LSTM) is adopted for VS construction with determination coefficient R -squared of 0.984.

The potential of using a prior standard deviation σ to improve the calibration accuracy is limited, only 8.61% on average.

The government and emergency responders need to take measures to mitigate disasters according to the forecast of landfall position, while slight timing error can be ignored. The reliability of operational model forecasts of typhoon landfall position needs to be evaluated beforehand, according to the forecasts and observation of historical cases. In the evaluation of landfalling typhoon track, the traditional method based on point-to-point matching methods could be influenced by the predicted typhoon translation speed. Consequently, the traditional track evaluation method may result in a large track error even if the predicted landfall position is close to observation. The purpose of this paper is to address the above issue using a simple evaluation method of landfalling typhoon track forecast based on the time neighborhood approach. In this new method, the timing error was lessened to highlight the importance of the position error during the landfall of typhoon. The properties of the time neighborhood method are compared with the traditional method based on numerical forecast results of 12 landfalling typhoon cases. Results demonstrated that the new method is not sensitive to the sampling frequency, and that the difference between the time neighborhood and traditional method will be more obvious when the moving speed of typhoon is moderate (between 15–30 km h −1 ). The time neighborhood concept can be easily extended to a broader context when one attempts to examine the position error more than the timing error. 登陆台风可以引起大范围的灾害。为了减轻登陆台风引起的灾害，政府应急响应部门需要根据登陆地点的预报采取相应的防御措施。从防灾减灾的角度来说，只要模式能够准确预报出登陆的地点，即使出现一定的时间偏差也是可以接受的。在评估登陆台风路径误差时，传统的点对点方法评估结果受台风移动速度影响较大。因此，即使模式能准确预报登陆地点，登陆时间的预报偏差也有可能会导致传统方法的评估结果出现较大的误差。 为解决以上问题，本文针对登陆台风路径评估提出了一种基于时间邻域的简便方法。新方法通过引入时间邻域来弱化时间误差对路径误差计算的影响，从而强调了位置误差在登陆台风评估结果中的重要性。基于12个华南区域登陆台风个例模拟结果，对时间邻域法和传统方法的评估结果进行了对比分析。结果表明，新方法对于时间邻域半径内的取样频率并不敏感，而且它与传统方法评估结果的差异主要体现在中等移速（15-30米/秒）的台风个例中。时间邻域法的概念可以被很容易地推广到那些位置偏差比时间偏差更加重要的情形。","['Earth Sciences', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Meteorology', 'Geophysics/Geodesy']"

The purpose of modifying BT with an IL is to improve the dispersion stability and lubricity of BT in lubricating oil. The dispersibility and tribological properties of IL—BT as oil-based additives for 500SN depend on the increase in interlamellar space in BT and improve as the chain length is increased. More importantly, the IL—BT nanomaterial outperforms individual BT in improving wear resistance, owing to its sheet layers were deformed and sprawled in furrows along the metal surface, thereby resulting in low surface adhesion. Because of its excellent lubrication performance, IL-modified BT is a potential candidate for the main component of drilling fluid. It can be used as a lubricating additive in oil drilling and oil well construction to reduce equipment damage and ensure the normal operation of equipments.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

This issue has rarely been considered in studies pertaining to erosion damage. In the present study, the ABAQUS software is used to investigate the erosion crater morphology and stress distribution on a target material subjected to overlapping impacts of spherical particles. Subsequently, the validated model is applied to investigate the effect of the overlapping impacts of particles on the target. Accordingly, the correlation between erosion severity and the impact locations of the two incident particles is quantified. The results show that the horizontal distance between two solid particle impact locations can significantly affect the erosion magnitude and pattern. The interactions of the resulting craters diminish when the horizontal distance exceeds 0.6 times the particle diameter. When the horizontal distance is approximately 0.06 times the particle diameter, the energy loss originating from collisions reaches the maximum, which modifies the crater morphology. The present study is expected to provide in-depth insights into erosion mechanisms and erosion modeling.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

However, the functional groups of GO that can contribute to anti-friction, anti-wear, and superlubricity are yet to be elucidated. Hence, further improvement in GO-family materials in tribology and superlubricity fields is impeded. In this study, macroscale superlubricity with a coefficient of friction of less than 0.01 is achieved by exploiting the high adhesive force between amino groups within aminated GO (GO-NH 2 ) nanosheets and SiO 2 . It was observed that GO-NH 2 nanosheets form a robust adsorption layer on the worn surfaces owing to the high adsorption of amino groups. This robust GO-NH 2 adsorption layer not only protects the contact surfaces and contributes to low wear, but also causes the shearing plane to transform constantly from solid asperities (high friction) into GO-NH 2 interlayers (weak interlayer interactions), resulting in superlubricity. A SiO 2 -containing boundary layer formed by tribochemical reactions and a liquid film are conducive to low friction. Such macroscale liquid superlubricity provides further insights into the effect of functional groups within functionalized GO materials and a basis for designing functionalized GO materials with excellent tribological performances.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

It allows occupants to connect and experience outdoor freshness within a semi-enclosed environment.

Using a validated computational fluid dynamics model, this study investigates the potential of various vegetative barriers or shelterbelts in attenuating the high wind speeds encountered in such spaces and the impact on wind and thermal comfort. Three skygarden configurations were investigated with and without vegetative barriers, simplified and modelled as porous zones, and their effect was studied on the velocity and temperature profile at the occupants’ level. The results indicate that while hedges and trees can offer resistance to airflow, trees provide higher temperature reduction. However, a combination of vegetative and geometrical barriers provides the most optimal condition in the skygarden. The study has identified the importance of assessing wind attenuation characteristics of tree plantations on highrise skygarden, and the results can be used in designing intervention strategies. Moreover, vegetation can attenuate pollutants and mitigate poor air quality by surface deposition, and future studies should investigate in that direction.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"

However, the airflow inside is more complicated and unpredictable. This study proposes a zonal temperature control strategy with a thermal coupling effect integrated for air-conditioned large-scale open spaces. The target space was split into several subzones based on the minimum controllable air terminal units in the proposed method, and each zone can be controlled to its own set-point while considering the thermal coupling effect from its adjacent zones. A numerical method resorting to computational fluid dynamics was presented to obtain the heat transfer coefficients (HTCs) under different air supply scenarios. The relationship between heat transfer coefficient and zonal temperature difference was linearized. Thus, currently available zonal models in popular software can be used to simulate the dynamic response of temperatures in large-scale indoor open spaces. Case studies showed that the introduction of HTCs across the adjacent zones was capable of enhancing the precision of temperature control of large-scale open spaces. It could satisfy the temperature requirements of different zones, improve thermal comfort and at least 11% of energy saving can be achieved by comparing with the conventional control strategy.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"

Multi-objective optimization could be an effective tool for tackling the aforementioned challenges. Therefore, this paper proposes a life-cycle optimization framework considering thermal comfort, which is beneficial to promoting residents’ motivation for low-carbon retrofit in arid climate regions. First, in response to the above problems, three objective functions are specified in the framework, which are global warming potential (GWP), life cycle cost (LCC), and thermal discomfort hours (TDH). To improve the optimization efficiency, this research uses Deep Neural Networks (DNN) combined with NSGA-II to construct a high-precision prediction model (meta-model for optimization) based on the energy consumption simulation database formed by the orthogonal multi-dimensional design parameters. The accuracy index of the modified model is R 2 > 0.99, cv(RMSE) ≤ 1%, and NMBE ≤ 0.2%, which gets rid of the dilemma of low prediction accuracy of traditional machine learning models. In the scheme comparison and selection stage, the TOPSIS based on two empowerment methods is applied to meet different design tendencies, where the entropy-based method can avoid the interference of subjective preference and significantly improve the objectivity and scientific nature of decision analysis. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is conducted on the variables, which supports guidance for practitioners to carry out the low-carbon design. Finally, the multi-objective optimization analysis for a farmhouse in Turpan is taken as a case study to evaluate the performance of the framework. The results show that the framework could significantly improve the building performance, with 60.8%, 52.5%, and 14.2% reduction in GWP, LCC, and TDH, respectively.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"

Physics-informed machine learning could address this need by adding physical consistency to such models. This paper presents metamodeling of thermal comfort in non-air-conditioned buildings using physics-informed machine learning. The studied metamodel incorporated knowledge of both quasi-steady-state heat transfer and dynamic simulation results. Adaptive thermal comfort in an office located in cold and hot European climates was studied with the number of overheating hours as index. A one-at-a-time method was used to gain knowledge from dynamic simulation with TRNSYS software. This knowledge was used to filter the training data and to choose probability distributions for metamodel forms alternative to polynomial. The response of the dynamic model was positively skewed; and thus, the symmetric logistic and hyperbolic secant distributions were inappropriate and outperformed by positively skewed distributions. Incorporating physical knowledge into the metamodel was much more effective than doubling the size of the training sample. The highly flexible Kumaraswamy distribution provided the best performance with R 2 equal to 0.9994 for the cold climate and 0.9975 for the hot climate.

However, the FMP-MR energy dissipation mechanism is not fully understood owing to its disordered grid interpenetrating structure. In this work, computer-aided preparation technology is used to accurately reconstruct the complex spiral network structure of FMP-MR multipoint random contact, and a cell group model with an energy dissipation mechanism is proposed to obtain the dynamic energy distribution of the contact friction in both space and time dimensions. By judging the effective contact point, a global displacement ablation phenomenon of hooked staggered porous materials is induced. The macro- and micro-equivalent frictions are introduced to effectively explain the characteristics of the strong energy dissipation in FMP-MR under fretting excitation. A real and effective damping hysteresis constitutive model is then constructed to dynamically capture the mapping relationship between the complex nonlinear topological structure effect of the materials and spatial random contact dry friction in real time. The results indicate that the contact behavior between turns of the FMP-MR wire follows a clear quasi-Gaussian distribution under an external load, forcing the topological results to change. The energy dissipation of the materials revealed peak energy consumption lagging behind the loading limit for a certain distance, which can be determined by the effective contact point and contact dry friction slip. The consistency between the quasi-static compression tests and constitutive curves of the model was quantitatively verified through residual analysis. The data demonstrated the differential behavior of the FMP-MR meso-structure to follow a phased growth law during loading with different action mechanisms in the guiding, main growth, and relaxation stages of the energy consumption displacement curve. In summary, these findings provide an acceptable theoretical basis for the damping energy consumption mechanism and lifetime prediction of FMP-MR.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

Based on experimental results obtained on a simple test structure and corresponding numerical validation using both complex eigenvalue analysis (CEA) and transient dynamic analysis (TDA), this study attempts to propose a new fundamental mechanism for FIVN, which is the repeated cycles of partial detachment and then reattachment of the contact surfaces.

Recent FFM measurements on a NaCl crystal immersed in liquid (ethanol) surroundings displayed an increase of the effective contact stiffness, K eff , with the applied load, differently from similar measurements performed under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, where K eff showed negligible load dependency. Additionally, under UHV conditions multiple slip length friction with increasing load was reported, while in ethanol surroundings only single (lattice unit length) slips were observed. Our current understanding of this behavior relates the transition from single jumps to multiple jumps dynamics to the normal load (manifested through the amplitude of the interaction potential at the contact, U 0 ) and to the damping of the system. Here we have incorporated the effect of the load dependency on both U 0 and K eff within Prandtl—Tomlinson based simulations, accompanied by variations in the damping coefficient of the system. Introducing the experimentally observed load dependency to K eff resulted indeed in single slip jumps at critical damping, while multiple slip jumps were obtained at constant K eff . The average slip length increased with the normal load, particularly when the system became underdamped. Our work provides a glimpse on the relation between the characteristic observables in atomic-scale sliding friction (maximal slip forces, stiffness, and slip dynamics) with respect to their governing parameters (corrugation energy, effective stiffness, and damping). While common understanding in nanotribology relates the effect of surrounding media mainly to the interaction potential at the contact, here we show that the media can also greatly affect the elastic interaction, and consequently play an important role on the transition from single to multiple stick-slip.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

However, the efficiency of these models relies on their capability to estimate more realistic building performance indicators at different temporal and spatial scales. The uncertainty of modelling occupants’ behaviours (OB) aspects is one of the main reasons for the discrepancy between the UBEM predicted results and the building’s actual performance. As a result, research efforts focused on improving the approaches to model OB at an urban scale considering different diversity factors. On the other hand, the impact of occupants in the current practice is still considered through fixed schedules and behaviours pattern. To bridge the gap between academic efforts and practice, the applicability of OB models to be integrated into the available UBEM tools needs to be analyzed. To this end, this paper aims to investigate the flexibility and extensibility of existing UBEM tools to model OB with different approaches by (1) reviewing UBEM’s current workflow and the main characteristics of its inputs, (2) reviewing the existing OB models and identifying their main characteristics and level of details that can contribute to UBEM accuracy, (3) providing a breakdown of the occupant-related features in the commonly used tools.

Micro-dimples were generated by a dual-frequency surface texturing method, in which a high-frequency (16.3 kHz) three-dimensional (3D) vibration and a low-frequency (230 Hz) one-dimensional (1D) vibration were applied at the tool tip simultaneously, resulting in the generation of the hierarchical micro-dimples in a single step. Rotating cylinder-on-pin tribological tests were conducted to compare the tribological performance of the non-textured reference specimen and micro-dimple samples. The effect of surface textures generated with various shape parameters (long drop and short drop), dimension parameters (length and surface texture density), and operation parameters (load and sliding velocity) on the tribological performance was evaluated. Stribeck curves indicate that the hierarchical micro-dimples exhibit a lower coefficient of friction than the reference specimen in the high contact-pressure regions. It is also observed that variation in the length of a micro-dimple, the shape effect, is the major factor affecting the friction response of the textured surfaces. The generation of additional hydrodynamic pressure and lift effect by hierarchical structures is the main reason for the improved performance of hierarchical micro-dimple surfaces.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

The oil starvation in and around the contacts is harmful to the performance and fatigue life of rolling bearings. Therefore, it is of necessity to understand the behaviors of oil transfer and the patterns of air-oil two-phase flow in bearings, especially with the influence of different capillary properties. This work established a transient air-oil two-phase flow model in a ball bearing based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Groups of cases are implemented to investigate the behaviors of oil transfer and air-oil flow under different capillary conditions with speed, surface tension, and viscosity. Flow patterns are classified by the morphological features of the air-oil flow. Staged phenomena are analyzed with flow patterns and reach good agreements with the observations from experiments. It is found that the oil distribution and air-oil flow behaviors in a ball bearing are strongly related to the speed and the ratio of oil viscosity and air-oil surface tension ( μ oil / σ ). The flow maps imply that the levels of capillary number (Ca) may be the boundaries and the critical points of flow pattern transition between the different flow patterns in bearing.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

We point to larger forces and specific practices that contribute to social reproduction within the academy, as well as those that have potential to restructure training and scholarship within academic disciplines. This chapter identifies cross-cutting themes that reflect ongoing challenges in understanding the convergence of institutional, disciplinary, and societal structures with the agency of individuals whose array of identities, motivations, goals, and needs are their own .","['Education', 'Higher Education', 'Educational Policy and Politics', 'Administration, Organization and Leadership', 'Sociology of Education', 'Curriculum Studies']"

Accounts of results produced from reinvigorated attention to the measurement, management, and improvement of the outcomes of health care show that much has been learned, and much remains to be done. This article proposes that causes of the failure to replicate in health care the benefits of “lean” methods lie in persistent inattention to measurement fundamentals. These fundamentals must extend beyond mathematical and technical issues to the social, economic, and political processes involved in constituting trustworthy performance measurement systems. Successful “lean” implementations will follow only when duly diligent investments in these fundamentals are undertaken. Absent those investments, average people will not be able to leverage brilliant processes to produce exceptional outcomes, and we will remain stuck with broken processes in which even brilliant people can produce only flawed results. The methodological shift in policy and practice prescribed by the authors of the chapters in this book moves away from prioritizing the objectivity of data in centrally planned and executed statistical modeling, and toward scientific models that prioritize the objectivity of substantive and invariant unit quantities. The chapters in this book describe scientific modeling’s bottom-up, emergent and evolving standards for mass customized comparability. Though the technical aspects of the scientific modeling perspective are well established in health care outcomes measurement, operationalization of the social, economic, and political aspects required for creating new degrees of trust in health care institutions remains at a nascent stage of development. Potentials for extending everyday thinking in new directions offer hope for achieving previously unattained levels of efficacy in health care improvement efforts.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Health Informatics', 'Psychometrics', 'Health Administration']"

To support research and practice promoting collective action to address sustainability issues, we define the term “collective environmental literacy” by delineating four key potent aspects: scale, dynamic processes, shared resources, and synergy. Building on existing collective constructs and thought, we highlight areas where researchers, practitioners, and policymakers can support individuals and communities as they come together to identify, develop, and implement solutions to wicked problems.

How this microscopic-macroscopic interaction occurs is poorly understood, as researchers frequently examine models within particular ranges of abstraction and scale. Computational neuroscience and machine learning models offer theoretically powerful analyses of plasticity in neural networks, but results are often siloed and only coarsely linked to biology. In this review, we examine connections between these areas, asking how network computations change as a function of diverse features of plasticity and vice versa. We review how plasticity can be controlled at synapses by calcium dynamics and neuromodulatory signals, the manifestation of these changes in networks, and their impacts in specialized circuits. We conclude that metaplasticity—defined broadly as the adaptive control of plasticity—forges connections across scales by governing what groups of synapses can and can’t learn about, when, and to what ends. The metaplasticity we discuss acts by co-opting Hebbian mechanisms, shifting network properties, and routing activity within and across brain systems. Asking how these operations can go awry should also be useful for understanding pathology, which we address in the context of autism, schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Psychiatry', 'Neurosciences', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Biological Psychology']"

Worldwide, millions of people are affected due to the consequence of climate change and particularly become the most vulnerable, by increasing the frequency and virulence of extreme meteorological events that cause population displacement and reduction in agricultural productivity.

Today there are three dominant schools of thought which consider how evidence can be used to inform policy outcomes; political science, decision-making theory, and policy studies. Political science emphasises the design of evidence, through classical models of social enquiry, as fundamental to ensuring political impact (Green 2005). Decision-science or decision-making theory emphasises the processes of deliberation and contestation through which decisions are reached thereby highlighting potential entry points at which evidence can be presented (Goldie et al. 2006). Meanwhile policy studies emphasises the process of policy formulation, with models ranging from decade-long cycles, to messy non-linear processes of coalitions weighing-up evidence inputs, beliefs, and political influences to design and advocate for interventions (Sabatier 1988; Cairney 2013). The most expansive literature on evidence to policy-uptake stems from the field of policy studies referred to as Evidence-Based or Evidence-Informed Policy (EBP / EIP), which has borrowed heavily from the evidence-based practice movement which started in medical research.","['Environment', 'Sustainable Development', 'Social Policy', 'Public Policy']"

Citizen science has been shown to be a very good tool for providing useful data for scientists, if well directed. For example, the monitoring of invasive species is impossible to do from research institutes due to lack of money, tools and personnel. But well trained, even sporadic tourists can give useful information about their distribution. This is also true in the case of rare or endangered species, or in migrations or the detection of anomalies. They can also be useful in tracking marine litter, not only helping to clean beaches and seabed, but also observing the origin of that waste thanks to photos or collections that can be used to understand where the objects come from. Other observations and data collection are more complex, and require specialists to make adequate quantitative observations, but may still benefit from broad support from people who want to help in the logistical part. Once again, indigenous people are put in the spotlight, because they help to solve many problems thanks to their great local wisdom. We are realizing that many of the things we do to monitor and give keys for conservation are provided by local populations who have lived in, protected or managed the areas we want to study for hundreds of years or millennia. That is why it is important to accelerate the follow-up processes by broadening the spectrum of people who can help in these processes, professionals and non-professionals alike. However, there are limits. Specialist teams are still needed to do sampling, monitoring or experiments. The tools used by scientific research teams to make such monitoring programs have substantially advanced. The technology to keep track of the problems we have in the oceans has made a really important qualitative leap. For example, although attempts have been made to track oil spills in certain circumstances, only the collection of data by specialists can help to understand the origin of contaminants. Coastal and ocean governance needs a paradigm change. We need co-governance processes in which democratic decisions, education and awareness-raising fit together. The models in which people interact with science, problems and solutions about the oceans are more and more demanded, and the last two decades have been crucial. An authentic bottom-up process in which all these advances and the different ways of observing nature and the impacts suffered are available to non-specialists. Without that bridge, we will not be able to create the necessary conditions to reverse the process of deterioration of our oceans.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"

Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) is such a framework that aims to improve the relationship between science and society. Now a decade after its conceptualization, it still seems to suffer from conceptual unclarity and lack of implementation. Since responsibility in research and innovation practice remains as important as ever, we propose to revive the normative potential of RRI by approaching it as a matter of collective democratic experimentation. To further develop this approach, we propose a pragmatist conceptualization inspired by John Dewey, his work on democracy as an ethical way of life and his attention to the contextual nature of responsibility. Furthermore, we show how his interest in social inquiring publics provides a particularly apt foothold from which to operationalize collective democratic experimentation with RRI. We will illustrate the utility of this approach, with specific attention to the social, experimental and public character of social inquiry, by connecting it to the recent call to use social labs methodology to experiment with RRI. From this we draw lessons for future collective democratic experimentation with responsibility in research and innovation practice.","['Philosophy', 'Research Ethics', 'R & D/Technology Policy', 'Innovation/Technology Management']"

More specifically, climate change is a multifaceted challenge that can affect Pest’s dynamics and behavior. Besides, climate change consequences can lead to changes in the abundance and geographic distribution of different pests. These changes are responsible for the emergence of emerging pests that are commonly thought to be related to the global trade in agricultural products. For various reasons, such as the lack of a natural enemy, it is impossible to control emerging pests by biological methods, while many pests are resistant to pesticides. Due to this fact, awareness of climate change’s effects on emerging pests’ emergence is now essential.

This has resulted in a posthumanism that from the beginning has been more embodied, more aware of the “difficult entanglements” involved in “making kin” with non-human subjects. We offer a survey of important Latin American thinkers such as Eduardo Viveiros de Castro and Arturo Escobar as important figures in a Latin American tradition of what we may now call posthumanism and we review the recent literature on posthumanism, the limits of the human, and new materialisms in the field of Latin American studies. Finally, we show how the authors in this collection argue for the ways in which Latin American and Latinx works of speculative imagination produce new strands of posthumanist thought from these sites of enunciation.","['Literature', 'Latin American/Caribbean Literature', 'Fiction', 'Latin American Cinema and TV', 'Latin American Culture']"

The aspiration principles tell us what level of safety or risk reduction we should aim at or aspire to. Important examples are Vision Zero, continuous improvement, ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable), BAT (best available technology), cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, risk limits, and exposure limits. The error tolerance principles are based on the insight that accidents and mistakes will happen, however much we try to avoid them. We therefore have to minimize the negative effects of failures and unexpected disturbances. Safety principles telling us how to do this include fail-safety, inherent safety, substitution, multiple safety barriers, redundancy, and safety factors. Finally, evidence evaluation principles provide guidance on how to evaluate uncertain evidence. Major such principles are the precautionary principle, a reversed burden of proof, and risk neutrality.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

This chapter provides a typology and systematic overview of safety principles and an analysis of how they relate to Vision Zero. Three major categories of safety principles are investigated. The aspiration principles tell us what level of safety or risk reduction we should aim at or aspire to. Important examples are Vision Zero, continuous improvement, ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable), BAT (best available technology), cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, risk limits, and exposure limits. The error tolerance principles are based on the insight that accidents and mistakes will happen, however much we try to avoid them. We therefore have to minimize the negative effects of failures and unexpected disturbances. Safety principles telling us how to do this include fail-safety, inherent safety, substitution, multiple safety barriers, redundancy, and safety factors. Finally, evidence evaluation principles provide guidance on how to evaluate uncertain evidence. Major such principles are the precautionary principle, a reversed burden of proof, and risk neutrality.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

The authors intend to reach out to many readers with different backgrounds and interests. The study employs inter- and transdisciplinary framing of the knowledge systems. This includes an implicit criticism of the typical narrowing of study to disciplinary siloes. It is claimed that traditional academic research misses the importance and positive contributions of different knowledge traditions and thought styles, and it is further claimed that inclusivity of these traditions is an ethical component of responsible research. In this sense, it is hoped that the following chapter inspires researchers to transcend institutionalized knowledge framings and opt for co-production of knowledge that is ethically responsive to rich cultural traditions in the Arctic.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-19467-2_4,en,Fishing and Overfishing-Sustainable Harvest of the Sea,OriginalPaper,"The impacts of industrial fishing have been present in the oceans for over one hundred years, but the exponential increase all over the world and the systematic exploitation of different areas started after world war II. The phenomenon of fishing has to be understood in order to understand the changes in the oceans, and such deep transformation is essential to capture the essence of the resilience: the collapse of fish stocks, the lack of biodiversity, and the profound transformation of ecosystems due to overfishing is in part responsible for the ocean’s impacted functioning that we witness today. It now seems that the collapse of many habitats is to blame for rising acidification or temperature, but the reality is that the impact of overfishing on pelagic and benthic systems is largely responsible for the profound transformations we see today. Trawling has devastated entire ecosystems, destroying the complexity of marine forests, both those that are dominated by vegetal organisms (macroalgae and phanerogams) and those dominated by animals (corals, gorgonians, sponges, etc.). It has been possible to verify that it is not only the destruction of the structures, but the compaction of the sediment and the continuous resuspension that made possible the impoverishment of the communities and therefore of the impoverishment of the fishing stocks. Beyond these impacts, pelagic fisheries have seen profound changes in populations, which evolve to the sound of fishing pressure. The minimum size of successful reproduction (i.e. the size in which the fish is lying eggs to promote the continuity of the populations), for example, has been drastically changed in many species, making possible for populations to survive despite the immense pressure of the predator, us. In addition, these fisheries highlight the fact that many animals are trapped with nets and long lines (dolphins, turtles, birds, etc.). The solutions to these problems are sometimes difficult to apply. These large organisms are usually essential for the health status of the ecosystem and the maintenance of the biodiversity, but we are impacting them in such a way that they have become irrelevant from an ecosystem functioning point of view. The so-called by-catch of smaller organisms is another huge problem. Discards (sometimes more than 50% of fisheries) profoundly harm and transform the ecosystem, and are difficult to sell in the fishing market. Solutions have been sought for decades and this collateral damage has been denounced, but there is still a long way to go. There is also a long way to go to eliminate the high percentage (calculated in more than a quarter of the fish landings of the entire planet) of those known as illegal, unreported and unregulated fisheries. This type of mismanagement of the sea is at the heart of the active policies of many countries, but without transparency and transnational actions, it will it will be difficult to reach a good agreement to suppress or minimize them. In fisheries models, apart from direct impacts, the effects of climate change have long been implemented. As already explained in the previous chapter, rising temperatures and the effects of acidification are transforming the landscape of primary and secondary productivity. The most obvious of these changes is the fact that there will be less fishing, and therefore less production. The effect of lower productivity is already felt in several long-lasting time series, where fishing is being affected by the decrease in phytoplankton. But, in addition, there are less obvious effects. One is the substitution of species, because some are more vulnerable than others to the increase in temperature, so that in the same taxonomic and functional group those who are best adapted to the new conditions win. Another is the expansion of invasive species that directly affect the food chain, and that may feel more comfortable with the new “rules” of fisheries impact and climate change. Some animals are already undergoing these changes, such as cetaceans dying of starvation in certain areas where the synergistic effects of fishing and climate change are felt. The co-governance of fisheries, in which scientists, politicians and society work together, is essential to move forward. They are not hollow words; they are real needs in a world of an excessively accelerated change.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"

The feats of human creativity and innovation provide our conspecifics too much to marvel at and feel proud of what human civilization has achieved in the course of its evolution down the ages. However, despite all our technological sophistications, we have failed to achieve this glory without compromising the ecological balance of nature. The ecological fallout of anthropogenic activities makes us ponder over the drawbacks inherent in man-made technologies. From this perspective, insects emerge as serious competitors to man because their intriguing evolutionary history is a unique success story which saw their domination in all habitats and resulted in their unprecedented diversity without disturbing the environment and its delicate balance. This is such a remarkable thing that tempts us to learn a lot from insects and come up with novel, environment-friendly, and more efficient technologies. Many branches of life sciences such as genetics, molecular biology, developmental biology, and chronobiology have benefitted so much from the studies on insects that insect models have become indispensable for their growth. Interestingly, insects have been an inspiration behind many of the technological advancements of our contemporary world. The fields of aviation and architecture owe a lot to insects for some of the bizarre designs and out-of-box ideas. Over the past few decades, there has been a significant rise in the application of insects for achieving technological breakthroughs. Materials science is coming forward as a major beneficiary of insect-derived substances with interesting properties which find application in various industries and are appearing in a large variety of useful products. Further, the movement patterns of insects are leading to innovations in robotics and prosthesis. The present review takes a closer look at the uses of insects in the growth of science and technology. It gives a bird-eye-view of the major developments in insect-inspired breakthroughs in basic sciences and their applications in technology and is expected to grab the attention of entomologists and technocrats alike. Given the rapid pace at which this subject is growing today, it is quite likely that it will soon find a prominent place in mainstream entomology syllabi.","['Life Sciences', 'Zoology']"

The basic contrast is between statistical and metrological definitions of measurement. The mainstream statistical tradition focuses attention on numbers in centrally planned and executed data analyses, while metrology focuses on distributing meaningfully interpretable instruments throughout networks of end users. The former approaches impose group-level statistics from the top down in homogenizing ways. The latter tracks emergent patterns from the bottom up, feeding them back to end users in custom tailored applications, whose decisions and behaviors are coordinated by means of shared languages. New forms of information and knowledge necessitate new forms of social organization to create them and put them to use. The chapters in this book describe the analytic, design, and organizational methods that have the potential to open up exciting new possibilities for systematic and broad scale improvements in health care outcomes.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Health Informatics', 'Psychometrics', 'Health Administration']"

Traditionally, statisticians only focused on the analysis of small datasets, but now they have to interact with big data. The analysis of big data is complex and requires the collaboration of key stakeholders, such as business managers, IT specialists and statisticians to manage, store, analyze and interpret all the data. The objective of this paper is to re-assess the role of the statistician in this new and unfamiliar territory and to develop a big data life cycle framework to explain the purpose of the statistician in the big data life cycle from a business perspective. Qualitative analyses were conducted with senior managers at Woolworths South Africa and business consultants from South Africa and abroad. A quantitative analysis was performed with 15 senior managers in JSE-listed organizations in the Western Cape of South Africa. The findings from both the quantitative and qualitative information revealed different meanings from an organizational point of view, both in terms of the importance of being data driven and using big data. Based on the results of the study, we see that statisticians play a collaborative role due to the way they link the various phases of the phases of the big data lifecycle together. The role or function of a statistician and the way in which stakeholders need to collaborate to drive financial gain from the organization’s data, is not clearly understood. A big data life cycle framework is formulated based on the findings, highlighting the role of statisticians in each stage of the big data life cycle framework.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Spatio-temporal variation in abiotic and biotic conditions in these ecosystems results, however, in a mosaic of microhabitats that could differently affect juvenile growth and survival. To deepen our understanding of juvenile fish habitat requirements and their spatio-temporal use of lagoons, microhabitat characteristics and fish assemblages were monitored jointly in a small temperate lagoon (the Prévost lagoon), from March to October 2019. A total of 2206 juvenile fishes belonging to 22 species were collected. Resident lagoon species, especially Atherina boyeri , dominated the assemblage (74%), while, among migrant species, Sparus aurata (8%) and Liza aurata (5%) were the most represented. Changes in overall juvenile abundance were mainly temporal, following the seasonal shifts in water temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll a concentration (44.9% of the co-inertia). However, our results revealed that distinct types of microhabitats exist in small lagoons and that juvenile fish distribution among them is non-random. Indeed, fish species richness mainly differed among sampling sites in relation to their distance from the inlet and the complexity of the three-dimensional habitat structure (36.5% of the co-inertia). Juveniles preferentially selected microhabitats with medium to high structural complexity, which were essentially created by macroalgae. However, microhabitat preferences were both species and ontogenetic stage dependent, with more contrasting microhabitat requirements in young juveniles. These results underline the need for conservation measures to consider each lagoon as a dynamic mosaic of microhabitats with radically different importance for the juveniles of the various fish species that colonize them.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Freshwater & Marine Ecology', 'Environmental Management', 'Coastal Sciences', 'Water and Health']"

This adaptability relies, at least in part, on the fine-tuned expression of genes involved in plant colonization. The large-scale sequencing of fungal genomes, together with the wealth of associated transcriptomic data collected during plant infection, highlights that genes involved in plant colonization exhibit sophisticated waves of expression and are often enriched in particular regions of the fungal genome (e.g., in repeat-rich heterochromatic or sub-telomeric regions, or on accessory chromosomes). These specific locations suggest that an epigenetic control mechanism might be involved in the regulation of their expression. In this chapter, we provide a historical perspective on the tremendous amount of work accumulated on chromatin organization and remodeling, and on recent data on genomes and epigenomes of plant-interacting fungi, which have refined our understanding of the impact of chromatin structure on the regulation of genes involved in host colonization. We also highlight how functional analyses support the hypothesis of a chromatin-based control of gene expression in plant-interacting fungi, associated with the action of specific transcription factor(s). We conclude by outlining the next challenges to be addressed concerning the epigenetic regulation of fungal genes involved in plant colonization.","['Life Sciences', 'Microbiology', 'Plant Pathology', 'Microbial Genetics and Genomics', 'Plant Physiology', 'Mycology', 'Plant Sciences']"

In most of the RRI discourse, ‘stakeholders’ are used as a catchall phrase denoting societal actors without actually pointing to who they are, why their participation is important, what exactly they contribute and why they should be involved in the R & I processes. In the case of citizen engagement, a typical bias emerges around the inclusion of easily accessible groups of publics. In this chapter we look at stakeholder theory as it has been developed and used for strategic business purposes from the mid 80’s and suggest how stakeholder theory may be combined with RRI, RI and QH approaches and applied to research and innovation.

In addition, CO 2 fertilization can effectively improve ecosystem resilience on the TP. On the northwest plateau, the effects of LULCC and CO 2 fertilization on WUE are more pronounced during the driest years than the annual average.

Thousands of people provided input, in one way or another, to the post-2015 deliberations and each goal area (as well as the many topics that did not become goals) enjoyed lengthy debates both inside of and outside of the formal deliberation chambers, suggesting there is not one objective evidence to policy process which needs to be understood but instead a wide range of processes across different sectors and scales. To help focus this analysis and to provide an inter-sectoral perspective on these processes, Part 3 focuses on three very diverse themes of the debate; health, urban sustainability, and data.

Studies comparing fish use of estuarine habitats have focused disproportionately on sand and seagrass habitats, and along the U.S. east coast, previous studies that have made the direct comparison between subtidal salt marsh creeks, sand, and seagrass habitats were spatially narrow in scope. Here, we performed a comprehensive comparison of fish species composition, abundance, diversity, richness, and fish lengths across subtidal salt marsh creek (upper creek and creek mouth sites), sand, and seagrass habitats within a temperate lagoonal estuary. Daytime otter trawl sampling occurred at 45 sites within Barnegat Bay (New Jersey) in April, June, August, and October during 2012–2014. Seventy species representing estuarine transients, residents, southern strays, and shelf strays were observed, and juvenile and small adult fishes dominated the collections. There were some differences in species composition between habitats, with the assemblages in upper creek and seagrass habitats being the most dissimilar. Fish abundance, diversity, and richness were often higher in creek mouth and seagrass habitats than in sand habitat. Similar to seagrass habitats, creek mouths were shallow, more saline, and contained complex physical structure (macroalgae, marsh banks). Many fishes used all habitats (e.g., bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli ), but others were partial to certain habitats (e.g., fourspine stickleback Apeltes quadracus in seagrass). This study reaffirmed that many interacting factors shape fish assemblages and demonstrated the significance of marsh creeks to the subtidal habitat mosaic of this temperate lagoonal estuary.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Freshwater & Marine Ecology', 'Environmental Management', 'Coastal Sciences', 'Water and Health']"

doi:10.1007/978-981-19-5566-2_7,en,Harnessing Scientific Knowledge and Technological Innovation for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) in Sub-Saharan Africa-Case of Social Media,OriginalPaper,"The biggest challenge to disaster risk reduction (DRR) in Sub-Saharan Africa is being presented by climate change due to the continent’s acute vulnerability inherent in multiple stresses and low adaptive capacity. It is common knowledge that the task of managing disaster risks and disaster events is heavily dependent on scientific knowledge and evidence-based technique which doubles up as a pillar for investment in DRR and used as a basis for formulating disaster risk management techniques. In this way, the application of science and technology has the potential to substantially reduce losses of lives and property. The current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report (AR6) on managing the risk of extreme events and disasters thoroughly interrogates this aspect and provides the essential evidence base. Equally important is to note that climate change appreciation and discourse demands high scientific standards. As such, its acceptance and readiness to move to reduce its impacts through DRR techniques requires much more systematic and proven sets of data, methods and tools and much stronger scientific and technical support capacities than is the case at present in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Sendai Framework for DRR 2015–2030 (SFDRR) sent clear signals to the mandate of science, technology, and innovation in driving government activities that is based on developing and sharing the knowledge and solutions needed to improve the resilience of communities. As such, there is need to harness the new global scientific challenges to DRR if Sub-Saharan Africa is to remain afloat in the DRR framework. Fortunately, the current science and technology advances have reached levels where a global village has been created which makes available more than ever before, immeasurable amounts of information relevant to DRR through a simple mouse click. In this way, more actors from different disciplines and policy areas can harness the emerging scientific challenges for the enhancement of DRR in Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper is predominantly concerned with how disaster risks and losses in Sub-Saharan Africa can be further reduced through harnessing science and technology innovation in the case of Social Media.","['Earth Sciences', 'Natural Hazards', 'Environmental Policy', 'Sociology, general', 'Earth System Sciences', 'Governance and Government']"

Electric field strength (EFS) and specific energy (SE) of PEF ranged from 0 to 0.85 kV/cm and 0 to 110.96 kJ/kg, respectively, and SV processing for 12, 24, or 36 h at 60 °C was applied. The optimum PEF-SV processing conditions for short ribs were found at EFS of 0.85 kV/cm and SE of 110.96 kJ/kg with SV processing at 60 °C for 23.96 h. In the absence of PEF pre-treatment, the optimum SV time at 60 °C was 36 h. PEF pre-treatments (SE, 99–110.96 kJ/kg) followed by SV (24 h) at 60 °C resulted in a significantly lower cooking loss (%) and texture profile analysis hardness compared to PEF at all treatment intensities, followed by SV at 60 °C for 36 h. Furthermore, significant differences were not observed in the redness, hue angle, and chroma at different PEF-SV processing parameters. Therefore, for industrial applications, PEF-SV processing with EFS (0.85 kV/cm), pulse width (20 µS), pulse frequency (50 Hz) and SE (110.96 kJ/kg), and SV temperature–time combination of 60 °C and 23.96 h is highly recommended.","['Chemistry', 'Food Science', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general', 'Agriculture', 'Biotechnology']"

We review what “responsible practice” means in relation to the plant environments being documented, the infrastructures used to circulate data, the institutions involved in data governance and the communities involved in plant data work. We show how, across these domains, responsible plant data linkage involves consideration of technical, legal, ethical and conceptual dimensions, thereby: (1) creating and maintaining digital infrastructures, technical standards and discussion venues focused on critical data reuse; (2) developing adequate legal and institutional frameworks that work transnationally; (3) identifying and implementing guidelines for what constitutes acceptable data use, together with systems to monitor and allocate responsibility for breaches and mistakes; and (4) considering the variety of views on what constitutes agricultural development in the first place and how plant research can sustainably, reliably and responsibly contribute to achieving food security. The production of sustainable, responsible and reliable agricultural solutions in the face of climatic and political change depends on the flourishing of transnational, interdisciplinary collaborations such as those represented in this volume.","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy of Science', 'Plant Sciences', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Big data is a relatively new concept in the area of food science and not yet widespread, but it has excellent prospects for the future. With the emergence of this new concept, new science has also emerged, i.e., data science. The data scientist needs to operate under different disciplines, in comparison to the traditional mycologist, to extract the maximum potential from the data, through disciplined approaches strongly supported by statistics, computer science, and bioinformatics. In the near future, this new science could address issues related to the dynamics of food mycology and accelerate problem-solving and the creation of new insights. This chapter gives a snapshot of the history of classical methodologies and the advances in molecular technologies in foodborne fungi, a brief overview of the main omics approaches, and some perspectives on the use of omics in parallel with the science of data in the field of food mycology and mycotoxins.","['Life Sciences', 'Food Microbiology', 'Big Data', 'Big Data/Analytics', 'Food Science']"

CRISPR-Cas is a robust, straightforward, and programmable genome editing tool capable of mediating site-specific DNA modifications. The rapid advancements from discovery to clinical adaptation have expanded the therapeutic landscape to treat genetically defined diseases. Together with the technical developments in human DNA and RNA sequencing, CRISPR-directed gene therapy enables a new era to realize precision medicine where pathogenic mutations underlying monogenic disorders can potentially be corrected. Also, protective or therapeutic genomic alterations can be introduced as preventative or curative therapy. Despite its high therapeutic potential, CRISPR-Cas´ clinical translation is still in its infancy and is highly dependent on its efficiency, specificity in gene corrections, and cell-specific delivery. Therefore, this chapter focuses on the challenges and opportunities the CRISPR-Cas toolbox offers together with delivery vehicles to realize its use for therapeutic gene editing. Furthermore, we discuss the obstacles the CRISPR-Cas system faces for successful clinical translation and summarize its current clinical progress.","['Biomedicine', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Genetics and Genomics', 'Physiology']"

However, despite favourable conditions, empirical evidence shows that efforts to mainstream RRI at the level of policy practice and implementation by and large failed. With the aim of better understanding the reasons for the limited success of mainstreaming RRI, the authors draw on the concept of Deep Institutionalisation (DI) and adapt it to the analysis of institutionalisation processes related to policy practice and implementation. The adapted DI concept is applied to H2020 by using recent findings from RRI research to provide empirical illustration. The results suggest that key preconditions for the successful institutionalisation of RRI policies were not fulfilled. Specifically, broader policy debates reaching beyond the confines of a small policy arena within the European Commission, a lack of experimental embedding allowing for adjustment to different contexts, and the development of ownership in particular were not achieved. Building on the cornerstones of the DI concept, the authors conclude that attempts to mainstream RRI in H2020 have been premature.","['Philosophy', 'Research Ethics', 'R & D/Technology Policy', 'Innovation/Technology Management']"

Rasch analysis, absent construct theory Construct theory and an associated specification equation, is a black box in which understanding may be more illusory than not. Finally, the quantitative hypothesis can be tested by comparing theory-based trade-off relations with observed trade-off relations. Only quantitative variables (as measured) support such trade-offs. Note that to test the quantitative hypothesis requires more than manipulation of the algebraic equivalencies in the Rasch model or descriptively fitting data to the model. A causal Rasch model Rasch model involves experimental intervention/manipulation on either reader ability or text complexity or a conjoint intervention Interventions on both simultaneously to yield a successful prediction of the resultant observed outcome (count correct).

This purpose is linked with the general interest of science for analyzing interactions between human societies and natures, which is currently relevant not only from theoretical perspectives but also to design strategies to face environmental problems characterizing the global socio-ecological crisis. Ethnobotany, as ethnobiological sciences in general, has advanced in the construction of valuable theoretical and methodological frameworks, which have made visible the enormous value of the local experience of thousands of communities throughout the world, whose knowledge and techniques of managing plants and ecosystems are the foundation of sustainable forms of biocultural interactions. In this chapter, some relevant theoretical and methodological advances and challenges for ethnobotanists working in Mexico are identified, emphasizing the importance of ethnobotany and ethnobiological sciences in establishing bridges of dialogue among different sectors of the societies that make decisions on biodiversity issues. Such role positions ethnobotany as a key transdisciplinary field for research and action for: (1) understanding traditional botanical knowledge, (2) developing criteria to protect biodiversity and intellectual property rights, (3) understanding the origin, diversification, and diffusion of agrobiodiversity, (4) the sustainable management of plants and ecosystems, and (5) to continue biocultural diversity conservation, as the central point in the agenda of ethnobotany. Such agenda is intimately linked to anthropology, ecological economy, and ecological and evolutionary sciences. In addition, one main challenge is to link ethnobiological sciences with sustainability science. This is an emerging scientific approach based on new paradigms for conducting research, which are needed to understand and act in the context of the global environmental crisis. The chapters of this book reflect the different perspectives and research approaches developed by ethnobotanists in Mexico, but also their views about the ways ahead. We emphasize the need of making explicit the insertion of ethnobotany with other research fields for constructing new theoretical and methodological perspectives, but, especially, to promote studies about cultures, ecosystems, and regions scarcely explored. We identify areas and cultures that are research priorities at present. Also, we emphasize the necessity to enhance the insertion of ethnobotany and ethnobiological sciences in educational programs as well as in institutions that make decisions through public policies related to biocultural issues. This final chapter summarizes views emerging from the cases included in the book and provide some reflections we consider relevant to study the ethnobotany of the mountain regions of Mexico but that may also be helpful for ethnobotanists in other regions of the world.","['Life Sciences', 'Plant Systematics/Taxonomy/Biogeography', 'Plant Anatomy/Development', 'Plant Physiology', 'Plant Breeding/Biotechnology', 'Plant Pathology']"

Here, various examples of unidirectional motion at surfaces are presented, which cover both rotation and translation of single molecules. Two ways to achieve unidirectionality are discussed. First, the presence of a local gradient that deforms the potential energy surface and leads to unidirectionality. This can be caused by the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope, which is also a very suitable instrument to follow the motion of individual molecules. Second, intrinsic unidirectionality of a molecule-surface system, which is of particular interest to be employed in molecular machines for useful work at the atomic scale.","['Materials Science', 'Materials Science, general', 'Nanoscale Science and Technology']"

This chapter scrutinizes the top academic performance attained by Taiwanese students by reviewing the national intended curriculum and guidelines, implemented teacher education and instruction, established textbook policies, and effects of national entrance examinations based on the Tri-Partite model. Intended curriculum defines what students should learn in schools at the country level; implemented curriculum refers to how and with what tools teachers instruct; attained curriculum is what students achieve. How the intended, implemented, and attained curricula interact to result in top performances for Taiwanese students among the education systems participating in international large-scale assessments is explained in detail. The traditional emphasis on the attained curriculum in Taiwan’s society seems to enhance Taiwanese students’ academic performance by ensuring they acquire basic skills and content knowledge in subject domains and related learning areas. Nonetheless, the need for modern citizens with high-level cognitive reasoning, autonomous problem-solving skills, modern digital learning abilities, and elevated well-being calls for advanced educational policies and practices in Taiwan. Investing educational resources in disadvantaged populations would ameliorate the serious achievement gap observed in Taiwan and thus strike a balance between equity and excellence. Along with the 12-Year Basic Education, Taiwan integrates the three parts of the curriculum to maintain its students’ top academic performance while aiming to reduce the achievement gap and improve educational equity. Concurrently, Taiwan helps students’ well-being by encouraging them to become modern citizens who take initiatives, engage in interaction, and seek the common good.","['Education', 'International and Comparative Education', 'Education, general']"

The recurring theme of prosthetics in González Fernández’s texts is explored on two levels. First, the prosthesis motif affects the plot; that is, how the characters use or act as prostheses and the ways in which the discourse of anomaly frames their posthuman exceptionalities. Second, prosthetics concerns the act of representation: science fiction itself acts as a prosthetic device that supplements reality. Ugarte’s reading of González Fernández’s short stories thus depends upon a literal sense of the word prosthesis—artificial body parts—and a figurative use of the prosthesis as a tool for extension or amplifying that improves the functioning of a damaged or maladjusted reality—in this case, Cuba’s reality. Prosthetics in this collection function as a master trope for representational and fictionalization processes that, in turn, point to what she identifies as genre self-consciousness. Through meta-fictional references, nods to the reader, and self-referential tropes, González Fernández problematizes the understanding of science fiction and, ultimately, posthumanism, as primordially metaphorical narratives.","['Literature', 'Latin American/Caribbean Literature', 'Fiction', 'Latin American Cinema and TV', 'Latin American Culture']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-18720-9_1,en,Introduction,OriginalPaper,"Human desires and inquisitiveness often give rise to new scientific and technical developments. Nanoparticles (NPs) and nanostructures (NS) comprise an active area of research and a rapidly expanding innovative business with a diverse array of application industries. Due to its changeable physicochemical features such as melting temperature, water sorption, electrical and thermal capacitance, catalytic activity, and light absorption and emission, NPs and NS have risen to prominence in technological advancements, resulting in greater efficiency than their bulk substance. In contrast to their bulk counterparts, the nanoscale properties of matter vary considerably by modifying the sizes and topologies of nanomaterials (NMs), as well as their other distinctive properties. The surface charge of nanoparticles governs various aspects of NMs, including the selective adsorption of nanoparticles. As surface charge is a main predictor of colloidal activity, it modulates the organism's reaction to nanoparticle exposure by modifying the nanoparticles’ shape and size through aggregation or agglomeration formation. Agglomerated carbon nanotubes have more adverse effects than well-dispersed carbon nanotubes and aggravate lung interstitial fibrosis. The morphology or shape of NMs differs based on their mode of synthesis. The key morphological properties are planarity, sphericity, and aspect ratio. Small aspect ratio morphologies are often round, oval, cubic, prismatic, spiral, or columnar. Morphologies with a high aspect ratio resemble zigzags, helixes, and belts. Carbon-based, organic, inorganic, bimetallic, composite, metallic, metallic oxides, silica-based, ceramic, and polymeric nanoparticles make up the bulk of current NMs. Bottom-up and top-down processes, including precipitation, reduction, green synthesis, spinning, biological synthesis, molecular self-assembly, and vapor-phase deposition, may be used to manufacture NMs.","['Materials Science', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nanoscale Science and Technology', 'Materials Science, general', 'Immunology', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Veterinary Microbiology, Parasitology and Infectious Diseases']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-17215-1_2,en,Effects of Organic Agriculture on the Soil Carbon Stock,OriginalPaper,"The soil carbon (C) stock is comprised of the soil inorganic carbon (SIC) and the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock. A site-specific steady state equilibrium soil C stock evolves under natural conditions depending on the balance between soil C inputs (plant residues) and losses (decomposition, erosion, leaching). The SIC stock is perceived as being less dynamic than the SOC stock with uncertain effects of organic agriculture (OA) on SIC sequestration rate, and not the focus of agricultural soil and land-use management. In contrast, the SOC stock receives increasing attention due to its importance for the global climate and soil health. However, increases in the SOC stock may also alter the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance and this must be addressed in the assessment of soil C sequestration practices to mitigate climate change. The historical loss of SOC due to the conversion of natural ecosystems to agroecosystems provides an opportunity to use soil and land-use management practices to partially replenish lost SOC stocks. Topsoil (0–15 cm depth) SOC stocks have been shown to increase under OA management by 1.98–3.50 Mg C ha −1 compared to nonorganic management. But the addition of exogenous C (e.g., with manure) for this improvement and SOC sequestration for climate change adaptation and mitigation may be important. Compared to nonorganic management, topsoil SOC sequestration rates did either not differ or were 0.29–0.45 Mg C ha −1  year −1 higher under OA, respectively. However, assessments of SOC sequestration and stocks for the entire rooted soil profile are scanty but needed to fully address long-term effects of agricultural management on SOC. Lower primary soil C inputs due to lower OA yields and higher losses by tillage compared to conventional no-tillage (NT) system may result in lower steady state equilibrium SOC stocks in OA systems. There is some evidence that root C allocation is higher under OA than that under nonorganic management. More agricultural soils will be managed in the future by OA driven by increasing consumer demand. The net effects of increased soil and land-use management for OA on the global soil C stocks must be critically assessed also in relation to long-term field experiments to support the design of climate-smart and climate resilient agroecosystems. Therefore, the objectives of this chapter are to describe in detail what processes and practices result in changes in SIC and SOC stocks and sequestration in soils under OA management.","['Life Sciences', 'Agriculture', 'Climate Change', 'Climate Change/Climate Change Impacts', 'Climate Change Management and Policy']"

In the case of winemaking, a particular application of interest for food informatics is the sensory analysis of wines. This problem can benefit from the strong development that machine learning has achieved in recent decades. However, these data-driven techniques require accurate and sufficient information to generate models capable of predicting the sensory profile of wines. A review of the sensory analysis and volatile composition of wines is presented in this work, along with significant studies on the use of machine learning models to predict wine-related characteristics such as the antioxidant activity of polyphenols of wine and aroma compounds. In this sense, data from a sensory panel and analytical technology were gathered. This literature review reveals the lack of a homogeneous and sufficiently large database of sensory analysis related to the volatile composition of wines to develop machine learning models. However, among artificial intelligence approaches, the application of quantitative structure-odour relationship (QSOR) models is currently gaining importance. Recent studies show that it would be possible to predict quantitatively the sensory analysis of wines by QSOR models, using general volatile composition information. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to identify key aspects and guidelines for the development of this area.

Most organic banned pesticides belong to the insecticides based on chlorinated hydrocarbons, organophosphorus, carbamate, triazine, organotin, and pyrazole(phenyl-) insecticide classes. Notwithstanding the harmful effects of numerous pesticides, their application in agriculture is still practiced in many regions of the world. In this framework, this chapter is a literature review focused on highlighting (i) the role in agriculture and the actually annual production of 15 banned pesticides with high persistence (lindane, dieldrin, aldrin, endosulfan, parathion and parathion-metil, tributyltin oxide, DDT, pentachlorophenol, chlordane, heptachlor, paraquat, carbofuran, fenbutatin oxide, fipronil, and atrazine), (ii) its spreading in soil, water, air, and products, (iii) its toxicity on animals and humans and its fate in the environment compartments, and (iv) the ability of microorganisms to remove these compounds from the environment. Following the analysis of databases on the production, marketing and use have been found that pesticides such as lindane, dieldrin, aldrin, endosulfan, pentachlorophenol, chlordane, and heptachlor are still produced and marketed, even if the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants impose measures to eliminate their production and use. Furthermore, these pesticides are detected in fruits, vegetables, cereals, dairy products, meat products, chicken eggs, and aquatic organisms, thus increasing the risks to human health.

The teaching of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) is no stranger to this phenomenon, and there are numerous examples of it. In order to better understand how RVTs are implemented in MSE teaching, this review presents an analysis that has been carried out after a systematic search in three different databases. This systematic search aimed to find academic works describing tools based on RVTs to improve the teaching-learning process of MSE. The results obtained provide an overall picture of how RVTs have been used since 2010 in teaching MSE: (i) virtual reality (immersive and non-immersive) is the most widely used technology, followed at a considerable distance by augmented reality, while mixed reality is a technology that is rarely used currently; (ii) the field of MSE on which most papers have focused is Materials structure, processing, and properties . Based on this information, it is possible to open up lines of research that have not been explored until now.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Yet, it remains unclear if and how assessment frameworks influence urban planning, design and management. We contend that the potential of current NBS assessment frameworks is not fully exploited due to: (1) limited contextualisation of monitoring and assessment to place-specific contexts and (2) the depoliticisation of co-production. To address this, we present a practical five-step action framework to guide inclusive participation across different stages of monitoring and assessment of urban NBS, including indicator selection. Unlike previous approaches, applying selection criteria at the level of individual indicators, we also use criteria at the aggregate level of the indicator set. We conclude that participatory assessment contributes to mainstreaming urban NBS for sustainable and just cities, provided data is contextualised to local decision-making contexts and the process is designed to amplify marginalised voices.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Physical Geography', 'Environmental Management', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

We now understand that it is not enough to conserve, we need to regenerate. That regeneration goes through two different paradigm changes. The first takes into account upscaling plans. That concept is based on the fact that restoration to regenerate ecosystems is on the verge, but there is a lack of a good plan to create large-scale animal and plant forest restoration programs in different areas of the oceans. The second paradigm is the participation of people, but not only as volunteers; the restoration plans need them as customers. The first paradigm is closely linked to the second. There has to be a business model that allows, in part, to pay for conservation and restoration, which, in turn, will allow for regeneration. However, we are not talking about a privatization process, as has sometimes been attempted. It is not about allowing access only to those who can afford it. Is about making people of different economic statuses and possibilities a part of the process of restoring, and giving them a real return in terms of awareness, education and enthusiasm related to the enhancement and recovery of biodiversity and complexity. People are willing to pay to maintain that complexity, that beauty, that diversity of animals and plants. Tourism can, therefore, make a difference in new conservation plans. It is not enough to expand marine protected areas, we must provide financial mechanisms so that the surveillance and infrastructure of the area we want to regenerate can be maintained. At the same time that this area is preserved, it can be replanted. Methods to quantify biodiversity, calculate the metabolism of the system and recover degraded areas with underwater gardening exist. It is demonstrated, for example, in the advances made in transplant methods for phanerogams, the environmental DNA to calculate the biodiversity of the area, and the calculations on the state of health of a coral reef. However, technology and great advances are not enough. We need to implement an inclusive policy in which local people, especially indigenous people, help in both conservation and restoration processes. They are the first that want (and need) to maintain or recover the lost habitats, but in many cases the policy makers and some stakeholders do not consider them in the equation. We must create those conditions of synergy in which the academic world, the political world and society itself (local and foreign) come together to solve the problems related to the loss of ecosystem services in the oceans.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"

In this chapter attention will be focused on those particular kinds of abductive cognition that generate deep results, able to go beyond data thanks to a rich explanatory strength, in which asking “why” is the key-factor. Hypothetical cognition beyond data will be also described thanks to the illustration of model-based aspects of abduction, in which the activity of grasping the world, beyond what mere rough data suggests, takes advantage of models, diagrams, and simulations of various nature. Moreover, I will delineate the concept of manipulative abduction, first introduced in my book of Abduction, Reason, and Science , by showing how we can find methods of manipulative constructivity, in which cognitive processes are centered on the exploitation of external representations to the aim of reaching deep and very abstract results, able to powerfully transcend data, at the same time to create cognitive values “in” and “out” of data. In two separated sections I will illustrate (1) how the excessive emphasis on the merits of the computational programs which learn from data renders human abductive “creative” cognition increasingly assaulted and jeopardized, and (2) the challenges against human abduction and epistemic rigor on the part of what I call computational invasive “subcultures” based on rough computational explanations. Finally, thanks to the analysis of the computational system called AlphaGo , I will stress the attention to what I call locked and unlocked strategies that shed further light on the cognitive aspects of both humans and deep learning machines. The character and the role of these cognitive strategies is strictly related to the generation of cognitive outputs, which range from weak (closer to data) to strong level (beyond data) of knowledge creativity. Locked abductive strategies, even if cognitively weak, characterize (sometimes amazing) kinds of hypothetical creative reasoning and are typical of intelligent machines based on a massive exploitation of data, but they are limited in eco-cognitive openness , which instead qualifies human cognizers who are performing higher kinds of abductive creative reasoning, where cognitive strategies are instead unlocked and are able to transcend data.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

IPM is based upon the principle that some degree of plant injury is tolerable without requiring pest control. In addition, the most environment-friendly pest control tools should be combined in order to have a longer lasting pest solution.

This will cause severe environmental consequences because salinity can be detrimental to agriculture, aquaculture and human consumption. Tidal dynamics are important in regulating salinity in river deltas. However, there is still uncertainty about the influence of different tidal amplitudes on deltas’ salinity. This paper investigates the impact of various tidal amplitudes on the spatiotemporal salinity distribution in deltas through three-dimensional idealized modelling. Numerical simulations are carried out with a common hydrograph and different tidal ranges. Both tide-influenced and river-dominated cases were considered. Results suggest that small increases in the tidal amplitude in river-dominated or low tidal regimes cases can have positive effects against salinization. Tide-induced mixing helps to increase freshwater areas and volumes. The water in the delta remains fresh for longer periods in scenarios representative of microtidal regimes. Further increases in the tidal amplitude to meso- and macrotidal levels reverse these effects and reduce freshwater areas and volumes. Results were used to test how salinity correlates with channel orders and river discharge in the presence of tides. These correlations are controlled more by bathymetry than tidal forcing. This study provides important insights into how changes in tidal range could impact spatiotemporal salinity distributions in deltas.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Freshwater & Marine Ecology', 'Environmental Management', 'Coastal Sciences', 'Water and Health']"

This chapter conducts a comprehensive review of the literature on the strategies for agricultural carbon sequestration and GHG emissions reductions and their economic feasibility. A general lesson from this review is that carbon sequestration and GHG emissions reductions in agriculture is potentially attractive, depending on the environmental conditions, socioeconomic contexts and strategies analysed. Various agricultural strategies have been identified as appropriate measures to increase carbon sequestration and/or reduce GHG emissions, including conservation tillage, crop rotations, continuous cropping, residue retention, improved fertilisation, and afforestation. Adopting conservative tillage and continuous cropping might be economically feasible, while the economic feasibility for crop rotations varies across regions. Studies on the economic feasibility of improved fertilisation and residue retention provide mixed findings. The economic variable costs of afforestation in developing countries are relatively lower than the costs in developed countries. More considerations of co-benefits should be integrated into relevant climate policies. We need to further improve our recognition and understanding of the policy-making of agricultural climate policies, thereby substantially increasing their effectiveness and robustness.","['Energy', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Sustainable Development', 'Climate, general', 'Fossil Fuels (incl.

In lieu of these unintentionally performed services, the pollinating insects are rewarded with their food (pollen and nectar) by the flowering plants they visit. The International Community has recognized the importance of pollinators as an element of agricultural diversity supporting human livelihoods. The insect pollinators play a major role in global food production, which makes them a key element of crop production all over the world. The bees form the most important group of pollinators; however, different kinds of insects, such as flies, beetles, weevils, butterflies, moths and wasps are also important pollinators of several crops. To ensure a reliable source of pollinators, both managed and native, a more comprehensive strategy for management of crop pollination is needed. Several insect species are known for their use in managed pollination systems of important crops. This chapter covers and discusses the co-evolution of angiosperms and insect pollinators, types of pollination and pollinators occurring in the nature, types of insect pollinators and their diversity, impact of insect pollination on the crop production, importance of insects as pollinating agents for managed pollination, major insect pollinators of different crops and effects of managed pollination on native ecosystem with conclusive remarks on the importance of conserving pollinators for a brighter future of the crop production.","['Life Sciences', 'Zoology']"

To assess the local characteristics of the concretes, universal calculation dependencies are proposed, in which the characteristics of concrete (strength, ultimate deformations, and moduli of elasticity in compression and tension) are used as functions, and the distances from the center and angular speed of rotation are used as arguments.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Materials Science, general', 'Structural Materials']"

Then existing methods of electrophysical (in particular, electrothermal) impact in cement concrete technology are discussed. The electromagnetic activation of mixing water being one of the directions in the field of improving the technology for preparing concrete mixtures is considered and experimental results are presented. The electrophysical impact on concrete aggregates is treated, too. In this case, the surface is activated by a pulsed discharge, and the specific granulometric composition of the aggregate is provided. The electrophysical effect on cement slurries and concrete mixtures is studied with classification of corresponding processes and phenomena. By this, the polarization and electrization of concrete mixtures in an external high-voltage electric field in the process of vibration compaction change their rheological properties and create an activated nonequilibrium state of the system improving physical and mechanical properties of the final concrete structure.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Materials Science, general', 'Structural Materials']"

It would be the first three-year La Niña since the 1998–2001 event, which is the only observed three-year La Niña event since 1980. By examining the status of air—sea fields over the tropical Pacific in March 2022, it can be seen that while the thermocline depths were near average, the southeasterly wind stress was at its strongest since 1980. Here, based on a quaternary linear regression model that includes various relevant air-sea variables over the equatorial Pacific in March, we argue that the historic southeasterly winds over the equatorial Pacific are favorable for the emergence of the third-year La Niña, and both the anomalous easterly and southerly wind stress components are important and contribute ∼50% of the third-year La Niña growth, respectively. Additionally, the possible global climate impacts of this event are discussed. 根据美国气候预测中心/国际气候与社会研究所 (CPC/IRI) 和中国多模式集合预测系统 (CMME) 2022 年 4 月发布的厄尔尼诺-南方涛动 (ENSO) 预测结果, 拉尼娜现象很可能持续到北半球夏季和秋季, 即三年拉尼娜事件 (2020-2023) 发生的可能性很高. 这将是自 1998–2001 年以来的第一个三年拉尼娜现象, 而前者也是 1980 年以来唯一观测到的此类现象. 通过考察 2022 年 3 月热带太平洋地区的海气分布情况, 可以看出, 虽然温跃层深度接近平均水平, 但东南风应力达到了 1980 年以来最强. 基于包含 3 月份赤道太平洋地区重要海气变量的四元线性回归模型, 我们认为这一出现在赤道太平洋上的历史性东南风有利于第三年拉尼娜的出现, 且异常的东风和南风分量都很重要, 分别可贡献约 50% 的增长率. 此外, 本文还讨论了该事件对全球气候可能产生的影响.","['Earth Sciences', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Meteorology', 'Geophysics/Geodesy']"

A three-layer model of the functionally gradient structure of centrifuged and vibro-centrifuged concrete has been experimentally confirmed. Differentiation of the characteristics of layers of functionally gradient concrete is obtained: the concrete of the outer layers has the highest strength, modulus of elasticity, and the least deformability; the concrete of the inner layers demonstrates the lowest strength, modulus of elasticity, and the highest deformability; the concrete of the middle layers shows average characteristics. The corresponding deformation diagrams are also differentiated by layers.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Materials Science, general', 'Structural Materials']"

Underdeveloped conceptual theories that fail to expose a measurement mechanism are one reason for the incommensurable measurements. Without such a mechanism measurements cannot be linked to a fundamental reference as required by metrological traceability. However, traditional metrological concepts can be extended by allowing for direct links between different instruments, so-called crosswalks. In this regard, Rasch Measurement Theory proves particularly useful as it facilitates a co-calibration of different instruments onto a common metric. The example of the measurement of nicotine dependence through self-report instruments serves as a showcase of the problems in social measurement and how they can be overcome contributing to metrological traceability in the social sciences.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Health Informatics', 'Psychometrics', 'Health Administration']"

The HP was extruded using a co-rotation twin screw extruder at 30–60% FMC and 200–400 rpm SRS. Results showed that significant differences were observed from FMC, SRS and the interaction of FMC and SRS on the product expansion index, integrity index, water and oil absorption capacity (WAC and OAC), some texture profile parameters and colour characteristics. Decreasing FMC and increasing SRS tended to increase the texturization index, expansion index, WAC, OAC, integrity index and texture profile characteristics but decrease density, L * and b * values.

In recent years, studies have sought to propose milk proteins as natural carriers for bioactive compounds and develop nanostructures containing these compounds. Although most bioactive compounds have beneficial effects on health, some limitations such as low solubility in aqueous media, low stability to pH and temperature variations, and low bioavailability have hampered their use. We carried out a systematic review analyzing interaction mechanism studies and nanoencapsulation studies to analyze the progress of using milk proteins as carriers of bioactive compounds. To better understand the subject, a brief review of the characteristics of milk proteins and the techniques used in interaction mechanism studies were also included in this review. We initially discuss interaction mechanism studies involving milk proteins and β-carotene (BC), a bioactive compound chosen to be explored. These studies are essential because they report the different mechanisms of milk proteins in BC complexation. Thus, it made it possible to understand that hydrophobic forces were the main ones involved in the interaction mechanism between milk proteins and BC. Changes in pH and/or temperature can cause changes in the structure of proteins, which influence the complexation process. Finally, we analyzed the studies that formed nanostructures containing BC from milk proteins. Emulsification was the outstanding methodology in nanoencapsulation of BC by milk proteins. The use of polysaccharides and polyphenols improved the milk proteins’ performance in formingation and stabilizing nanostructures containing BC.","['Chemistry', 'Food Science', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general', 'Agriculture', 'Biotechnology']"

A survey-based approach is however costly and time-consuming, and hence its information can be dated and limited to a particular region. Mobile network data thus emerges as a promising alternative data source that is massive in both cross-sectional and longitudinal perspectives, which provides a wider geographic coverage of travelers and a longer time of travel behavior observation. From the point of view of urban informatics, there are new opportunities as well as challenges in utilizing such data in travel behavior research.

In geopolymer concrete, the IBWA is partly replaced for GGBS by 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, and 50%, respectively. The primary objective of this research is to analyse the fresh and mechanical characteristics of geopolymer concrete combined with GGBS and IBWA. The findings were compared between groups that did not include any IBWA and material containing IBWA content. Results indicated that the 30% IBWA replacement level provided the greatest compressive strength at seven as well as twenty-eight days, with 35.3 N/mm 2 and 48.5 N/mm 2 , respectively. Addition of IBWA resulted in unfavourable effects when the content was higher than the recommended 30%. The results of the microstructure investigation also suggest a compact and dense geopolymer concrete micrograph at 30% IBWA, which may be attributed to the coexistence of geopolymerization products with additional calcium-based hydration products, according to the researchers. After the testing was completed, it was revealed that the presence of IBWA might be partly substituted as a raw material for geopolymer concrete, which would result in a cost reduction for the product. There is a possibility that this study will impact the use of hazardous IBWA as a construction material.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Building Materials', 'Construction Management']"

In conjunction with local impacts such as fishing, eutrophication or the invasion of alien species, to give just a few examples, the acidification of the oceans and the warming of the sea began to show its effects more than twenty years ago. These signals were ignored at the time by the governing bodies and by the economic stakeholders, who now see how we must run to repair the huge inflicted damage. Today, different processes are accelerating, and the thermodynamic machine has definitely deteriorated. We see, for example, that the intensity and magnitude of hurricanes and typhoons has increased. Most models announce more devastation of flash floods and a decomposition in the water cycle, which are factors directly affecting ecosystems all over the world. Important advances are also observed in the forecasting of impacts of atmospheric phenomena in coastal areas with more and more accurate models. Rising temperatures and acidification already affect many organisms, impacting the entire food chain. All organisms, pelagic or benthic, will be affected directly or indirectly by climate change at all depths and in all the latitudes. The impact will be non-homogeneous. In certain areas it will be more drastic than in others, and the visualization of such impacts is already ongoing. Some things may be very evident, such as coral mortalities in tropical areas or in the surface waters of the Mediterranean, while others may be less visible, such as changes in microelement availability affecting plankton productivity. In fact, primary productivity in microalgae, macroalgae and phanerogams is already beginning to feel the impact of warmer, stratified and nutrient-poor waters in many parts of the planet. Nutrients are becoming less available, temperature is rising above certain tolerance limits and water movement (turbulence) may change in certain areas favoring certain species of microplankton instead of others. All these mechanisms, together with light availability (which, in principle, is not drastically changing except for the cloudiness), affect the growth of the organisms that can photosynthesize and produce oxygen and organic matter for the rest of the trophic chain. That shift in productivity completely changes the rest of the food chain. In the Arctic or Antarctic, the problem is slightly different. Life depends on the dynamics of ice that is subject to seasonal changes. But winter solidification and summer dissolution is undergoing profound changes, causing organisms that are adapted to that rhythm of ice change to be under pressure. The change is more evident in the North Pole, but is also visible in the South pole, where the sea ice cover has also dramatically changed. In the chapter there is also a mention about the general problem of the water currents and their profound change do greenhouse gas effects. The warming of the waters and their influence on the marine currents are also already affecting the different ocean habitats. The slowdown of certain processes is causing an acceleration in the deoxygenation of the deepest areas and therefore an impact on the fragile communities of cold corals that populate large areas of our planet. Many organisms will be affected in their dispersion and their ability to colonize new areas or maintain a connection between different populations. The rapid adaptations to these new changes are apparent. Nature is on its course of restart from these new changes, but in this transitional phase the complexity and interactions that have taken thousands or millions of years to form can fade away until a new normal is consolidated.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"

Applying clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated proteins (CRISPR-Cas) for therapeutic gene editing represents a promising technology to correct this devastating disease through elimination of underlying genetic Genetics mutations. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has been widely used for gene therapy due to its low immunogenicity and high tissue tropism. In particular, CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing components packaged by self-complementary AAV (scAAV) demonstrate robust viral transduction and efficient gene editing, enabling restoration of dystrophin expression throughout skeletal and cardiac muscle in animal models of DMD. Here, we describe protocols for cloning CRISPR single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) into a scAAV plasmid and procedures for systemic delivery of AAVs into a DMD mouse model. We also provide methodologies for quantification of dystrophin restoration after systemic CRISPR-Cas9–mediated correction of DMD.","['Biomedicine', 'Human Genetics', 'Anatomy', 'Behavioral Therapy']"

These two alloys are not only comparable to commercial AZ31 alloy in extrudability, but also have superior mechanical properties, especially in terms of yield strength (YS). The excellent extrudability is related to less coarse second-phase particles and high initial melting point of the two as-cast alloys. The high strength—ductility mainly comes from the formation of fine grains, nano-spaced submicron/nano precipitates, and weak texture. Moreover, it is worth noting that the YS of the two alloys can maintain above 160 MPa at elevated temperature of 250°C, significantly higher than that of AZ31 alloy (YS: 45 MPa). The Zn/Ca solute segregation at grain boundaries, the improved heat resistance of matrix due to addition of RE, and the high melting points of strengthening particles (Mn, MgZn 2 , and Mg—Zn—RE/Mg—Zn—RE—Ca) are mainly responsible for the excellent high-temperature strength.","['Materials Science', 'Materials Science, general', 'Metallic Materials', 'Characterization and Evaluation of Materials', 'Ceramics, Glass, Composites, Natural Materials', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings']"

The ability to collect, purify, and manipulate primary cells outside the body permits testing of many different gene editing approaches. RNA-guided nucleases, such as CRISPR, have revolutionized gene editing based simply on Watson-Crick base-pairing, employed to direct activity to specific genomic loci. Given the ease and affordability of synthetic, custom RNA guides, testing of precision edits or large random pools in high-throughput screening studies is now widely available. With the ever-growing number of CRISPR nucleases being discovered or engineered, researchers now have a plethora of options for directed genomic change, including single base edits, nicks or double-stranded DNA cuts with blunt or staggered ends, as well as the ability to target CRISPR to other cellular oligonucleotides such as RNA or mitochondrial DNA. Except for single base editing strategies, precise rewriting of larger segments of the genetic code requires delivery of an additional component, templated DNA oligonucleotide(s) encoding the desired changes flanked by homologous sequences that permit recombination at or near the site of CRISPR activity. Altogether, the ever-growing CRISPR gene editing toolkit is an invaluable resource.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-19467-2_2,en,Marine Solid Pollution—From Macroplastics to Nanoplastics,OriginalPaper,"It is not surprising that we are interested in plastics as one of the most prominent polluting agents of the twenty-first century. We have gone from producing less than 10 million tons in the 1960s to more than 300 million in the 2010s. That plastic has had time to distribute itself, fragment and enter food chains of the oceans. Studies related to the three phenomena are now one of the main objectives of various research projects and groups around the planet. The first is understanding how fragmentation is increasing the volume of macro and microplastics, how they are dispersed at the oceanic and local level, and what their chemical characteristics are. In line with these observations and quantifications, we have to understand what influence they have on organisms and how we can reduce their concentration. For example, the displacements of macroplastics are modeled relative to their dispersion according to global and local currents, giving importance to the phenomena of fouling and fragmentation, as well as understanding how the creation of microplastics is heterogeneous according to latitude, water temperatures or seasonal conditions. One of the biggest problems is, without a doubt, the chemical, morphological and size classification of plastics, especially micro and nanoplastics. This topic is crucial, as is the standardization of the measures that we consider to classify them in one way or another. This topic has been largely discussed during the last decade, and in this chapter there are cues to understand that the consensus is very close. Other issues are still pending in the complex agenda of the understanding of these pollutants. For example, the adherence of certain types of elements such as heavy metals is a relevant issue on which much information is lacking. But it is not the only knowledge gap that we have. Dynamics in the water column and in the sediment is also a main issue, since this sediment is a sink for microplastics and nanoplastics that is continually disturbed by organisms from the meiofauna. Some of these microplastics become airborne, and their range from likely emission sources is still poorly understood. The understanding of these fluxes from the land-river to the sediments passing through the water column is one of the main challenges to solve the problems derived from the presence of such macro, micro and nano items. Marine organisms are the ones that, apparently, are the most affected by this increase in solid contamination, especially microplastics. Today they are found at any latitude, from the poles to the equator, even in places as surprising as sea ice or abyssal depths. In fact, microplastics are found in very remote places, interfering with the diet of various planktonic and benthic organisms. There are many questions to be resolved, among others, how temperature affects the retention of microplastics in organisms, or which are the most vulnerable species. And we have to understand one important issue: many of those marine organisms affected by micro and nano plastics are part of our diet. Therefore, understanding the rate of transmission in food chains in general and in our consumption in particular is a major issue. That is why we looked for solutions, such as the use of bioremediators (active suspension feeders such as sponges, sea squirts, etc.) in areas where the abundance of microplastics is especially high. Bacteria are also beginning to be used as active decomposers of microplastics, a solution that could help eliminate a large amount of this material about which we still have too many knowledge gaps regarding the health of ecosystems and our own health. The synergy of efforts to understand all these different variables is crucial. During the next decade we do have to solve this plastic problem, with coordination, standardization and the application of different tools to execute the solutions of different associated problems.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"

Supported by the literature, we argue that corporate sustainability is often weak sustainability, where sustainability issues are sought to be integrated into business rather than positioning business within sustainability. Drawing on a research-based understanding of sustainability, we propose the following definition of sustainable business: A business is sustainable when it, in aggregate, contributes to securing the social foundations for humanity, now and for the future, within planetary boundaries. We then focus on the role of interdisciplinarity for sustainable business research. We present the Daughters of Themis Network and its call for papers, which focused on moving beyond the widely accepted acknowledgement of the need for interdisciplinarity and instead explored how interdisciplinarity can be brought into effect. We briefly present the contributions in this volume, organised in three parts: Reflections, Theory, and Practice. The chapters present the depth and variety of interdisciplinary business research. We conclude with a call for strong interdisciplinarity in sustainable business research to overcome the limitations of our disciplines and to work towards the development of new methodologies and new knowledge to further sustainable business.","['Business and Management', 'Sustainability Management', 'Economic Geography', 'Diversity Management/Women in Business', 'Law and Economics', 'Business Ethics']"

These interactions are often critical to the basic developmental processes of cellular proliferation and differentiation, as well as to both the onset of disease sequelae and prevention of disease progression. In many tissues, proteoglycans and especially their glycosaminoglycan (GAG) components are mediators of these processes. The GAG family is characterized by covalently linked repeating disaccharides forming long unbranched polysaccharide chains. Thus far in higher eukaryotes, the family consists of chondroitin sulfate (CS), heparin/heparan sulfate (HS), dermatan sulfate (DS), keratan sulfate (KS) and hyaluronan (HA). All GAG chains (except HA) are characteristically modified by varying amounts of esterified sulfate. One or more GAG chains are usually found in nature bound to polypeptide backbones in the form of proteoglycans; HA is the exception. In the nervous system, GAG/proteoglycan-mediated interactions participate in proliferation and synaptogenesis, neural plasticity, and regeneration. This review focuses on the structure, chemistry and function of GAGs in nervous system development, disease, function and injury response.","['Biomedicine', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurochemistry']"

However, for tens of millions of people, this groundwater contained high levels of arsenic, which has led to what the WHO has called the “largest mass poisoning of a population in history.” This case study describes the development of ElectroChemical Arsenic Remediation (ECAR), which is a technology that uses iron electrodes to oxidize and remove aqueous arsenic from drinking water. Pilot evaluation of ECAR began in 2011, with a 100 L reactor at a school in Amirabad. However, political tensions in Amirabad caused the subsequent 600 L reactor pilot to be relocated to a school in Dhapdhapi. The findings from this pilot enabled the construction of a 10,000-liter per day (LPD) ECAR plant at Dhapdhapi. During this scaling up process, technical and contextual challenges were encountered and overcome, including those arising from intermittent power supply and a hot/humid climate. Additionally, implementation challenges included training of local operators, ensuring continuity of knowledge within the team, revisiting and correcting early mistakes, and additional engineering work needed during commissioning. The 10,000 LPD plant has been successful both technically and financially. However, after the handoff of the ECAR technology and plant to the local partner, Livpure in 2016, no widespread replication of ECAR plants in the region has occurred. The engineering science behind ECAR continues to be an active area of research, with ongoing projects investigating the implementation of next-generation ECAR technologies in rural California and the Philippines.","['Environment', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Development Economics', 'Development and Sustainability', 'Engineering Design', 'Social/Human Development Studies']"

Unfortunately, the allele linkage information needed to perform phased genome assemblies has been difficult to generate. Hence, most current genome assemblies are a haploid mixture of the two underlying chromosome copies present in the sequenced individual. Sequencing technologies providing long (20 kb) and accurate reads are the basis to generate phased genome assemblies. This chapter provides a brief overview of the main milestones in traditional genome assembly, focusing on the bioinformatic techniques developed to generate haplotype information from different specialized protocols. Using these techniques as a knowledge background, the chapter reviews the current algorithms to generate phased assemblies from long reads with low error rates. Current techniques perform haplotype-aware error correction steps to increase the quality of the raw reads. In addition, variations on the traditional overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) graph have been developed in an effort to eliminate edges between reads sequenced from different chromosome copies. This allows for large presence–absence variants between the chromosome copies to be taken into account. The development of these algorithms, along with the improved sequencing technologies has been crucial to finish chromosome-level assemblies of complex genomes.","['Life Sciences', 'Genetics and Genomics']"

In addition to posing a threat to human health, human waste contains high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus, which can wreak ecological harm when improperly discharged. However, nitrogen and phosphorus are also key ingredients for fertilizers used in agricultural food production. This case study follows the development of ElectroSan, a pre-revenue process engineering spinoff that focuses on novel processes for converting urine into valuable products. The two primary technologies ElectroSan uses to extract nitrogen from urine are ion exchange and electrochemical stripping. The efficacy of these technologies (primarily ion exchange) was investigated through field trials enabled by a partnership with Sanergy in Nairobi, Kenya. Through experimentation and market analyses, Dowex Mac 3 was identified as the most suitable resin for nitrogen recovery. Additionally, this process could produce ammonium sulfate fertilizer at a lower cost to competing products and also had the advantages of providing a steady, local supply of fertilizer that could be applied by fertigation. This approach thus avoided local ecosystem damage from improper disposal, created local economic opportunities, and partially closed the nutrient cycle locally.

Apel’s work is discussed as a challenge to analytical language philosophy via transcendental semiotics and discourse ethics. Three objections by Apel are identified here as a lacking grounding of objectivism ; methodological solipsism ; and a missing ethical dimension. Apel’s broader aim at reconciling analytic and hermeneutic philosophy is shown to draw on three notions of knowledge-interest : control via objectivity; communicative understanding; and emancipatory self-reflection, argued by means of a normative-hermeneutic social science approach to discourse ethics. The chapter then turns to Jürgen Habermas in his agreement with Apel on the critique of a too narrowly conceived notion of communication. A commentary on his confrontation with Gadamer is followed by an overview of Habermas’s writings on the public sphere , his distinction between purposive-rational action and symbolic interaction, the ideas of communicative competence and distorted communication , and his version of discourse ethics. In conclusion, the chapter identifies Habermas’s three hermeneutic principles, the inevitable involvement of the observer in interpretation, the context dependency of all interpretations, and the Kantian replacement of truth claims by explicatory negotiations.","['Philosophy', 'Continental Philosophy', 'Hermeneutics']"

The history of each unique subject and inability to impose rigid control of behavior without influencing behavior guarantees the impossibility of experimentation or the discovery of inexorable laws. Psychology is restricted to demonstration studies: empirical but not experimental. Behaviorism is the application of phenomenalism (presentationalizm): all that exists for science is overt behavior. Realism (representationalizm) is abandoned for instrumentalism: theories are just shorthand data summaries, never having “real” hypothetical constructs. Behavioristic external control buys regularity only by turning subjects into purely physical objects. Realism is superior to phenomenalism: it explains why different independently evolved senses point to one thing outside sense experience—an independent real world.","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy of the Social Sciences', 'Economic Psychology', 'Epistemology', 'Cognitive Psychology']"

As intrinsic interaction patterns also prevail at hierarchically different scales of ecological organization, organismic associations scale-invariantly represent holobiont-like systems (HLSs). This essay explores how high-ranking HLSs (ecosystems, biosphere) do evolve, in particular, under the conventionally gene-centric view at the Darwinian principles of mutation, heredity, and selection. Re-visiting evolution theory, shortcomings by DNA-restricted interpretations impede perceptions of HLS evolution, notably, at hierarchically high ecological scales. Any HLS is discernable as a selection unit, however, through considering genericness by widening DNA-encoded to structurally and functionally stored information upon historical contingencies in “E vo D evo E co ” processes, relating evolution, development, and ecology. On such grounds, HLS evolution proceeds through adaptive cycling and sequential selection, examining predictability versus stochasticity of aggregated information for adaptiveness to environmental variation. Each turn mirroring evolutionary advancement, cycling does not require resource-related competition as evolutionary driver. However, selection is reflected in competition in a sense of facing the challenge to maintain internal stability upon environmental changes. Such challenge becomes evident also in biospheric HLS Earth evolution through traded contingency effects upon manifold biogeochemical impacts. Although repeatedly inciting global species mass extinctions, such were pulse generators towards niches diversification and ecological complexity, owed to recurrent valuing scrutiny of sequential selection. Abandoning gene-centric perspectives, HLS evolution is borne by oscillating phases of consolidation versus renewal.","['Life Sciences', 'Plant Sciences', 'Forestry', 'Plant Biochemistry', 'Ecosystems', 'Plant Genetics and Genomics', 'Plant Physiology']"

Its application in other domains of social sciences is also limited. Few new industrial sectors have been proposed to be included in Perrow’s (1948) model. Geographical inequality was observed in the publication. Slight movement from high-reliability organizations (HROs) to other less hazardous organizations was also observed for mindfulness research. Our research is unique as bibliometric analysis on mindfulness constructs is almost non-existent in the present literature. Our study contributed to the present knowledge of the body by providing a holistic view of mindfulness research for over 16 years.

This chapter shows the application of measurement in a social science context where the motivation is transparency and equity rather than the advancement of scientific laws. However, to achieve these, the realization of measurement needs to be no less rigorous than it is in the advancement of scientific laws. Rasch measurement theory provides the basis for such rigor. The context in this chapter is competitive selection into universities in Western Australia based on a summary performance on a series of instruments which assess achievement in a range of discipline areas. Such selection tends to determine life opportunities; therefore to ensure consistency and fairness, performances on different instruments need to be transformed into measurements which are in the same, explicit unit relative to a specified origin. Because the illustrative context is complex, it is considered that the Rasch measurement theory applied in this chapter could be applied to a range of social contexts where assessments on different instruments need to be transformed to measurements in a common unit referenced to a common origin and where the focus is on making decisions at the person level.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Health Informatics', 'Psychometrics', 'Health Administration']"

The relationships of the three types of NCCV intensity with atmospheric circulations in late summer, the sea surface temperature (SST), and Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) in the preceding months, are analyzed. The sensitivity tests by the Community Atmosphere Model version 5.3 (CAM5.3) are used to verify the statistical results. The results show that the coordination pattern of East Asia-Pacific (EAP) and Lake Baikal high pressure forced by SST anomalies in the North Indian Ocean dipole mode (NIOD) during the preceding April and SIC anomalies in the Nansen Basin during the preceding June results in an intensity anomaly for the first type of NCCV. While the pattern of high pressure over the Urals and Okhotsk Sea and low pressure over Lake Baikal during late summer—which is forced by SST anomalies in the South Indian Ocean dipole mode (SIOD) in the preceding June and SIC anomalies in the Barents Sea in the preceding April—causes the intensity anomaly of the second type. The third type is atypical and is not analyzed in detail. Sensitivity tests, jointly forced by the SST and SIC in the preceding period, can well reproduce the observations. In contrast, the results forced separately by the SST and SIC are poor, indicating that the NCCV during late summer is likely influenced by the coordinated effects of both SST and SIC in the preceding months. 在利用高时空分辨率位势高度场和温度场资料对东北冷涡 (NCCV) 过程进行客观识别的基础上, 本文采用机器学习方法, 按活动路径特征将盛夏 NCCV 过程客观划分为三类. 在统计分析冷涡强度指数与同期盛夏大气环流场和前期海温 (SST)、 北极海冰 (SIC) 关系的基础上, 利用 CAM5.3 大气环流模式的敏感性试验对统计分析结果进行了模拟验证. 结果表明: 前期 4 月的北印度洋偶极子 SST 和 6 月南森海盆 SIC 异常造成第一类冷涡 (Clus-1) 对应的关键环流型—东亚太平洋 (EAP) 和贝加尔湖高压配合型, 进而造成 Clus-1 强度异常. 前期 6 月南印度洋偶极子 SST 异常型和前期 4 月巴伦支海 SIC 异常强迫形成盛夏乌拉尔山、 鄂霍次克海高压与贝加尔湖低压相配合的环流型, 进而造成第二类冷涡 (Clus-2) 强度异常. 前期印度洋 SST 和 SIC 共同强迫盛夏环流场的敏感性试验能较好地再现观测结果, 但 SST 与 SIC 各自单独强迫的结果较差, 说明前期 SST 和 SIC 信号对盛夏 NCCV 的影响可能是二者共同作用的结果.","['Earth Sciences', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Meteorology', 'Geophysics/Geodesy']"

A complementary function of engineering is also proposed, analogous to the translation between the objective lawfulness uncovered by theoretical sciences and the social lifeworld, through the materialization of truth in processes and commodities. These definitions make it possible to consider an ethical framework for the practice of engineering, which goes back to the Humboldtian maxim of transforming knowledge into deeds, that is, the question of how to convert the universality of facts into the particularism of values. Engineering ethics should not be confused with just another professional ethics, guided only by the internal regulations of the profession and by ethical standards and codes. On the other hand, it must not turn engineers into new moral heroes, the only social players responsible for solving dilemmas and ethical issues that arise with the massive arrival of technologies. Engineering should be understood as a collective practice of translation, creation and cooperation of alternative designs. This can contribute to the discussion of the philosophical relevance and ultimate goals of engineering practice.","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy of Technology', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'History of Technology']"

Then, in the light of the predominance that commercially oriented technoscience has gained in contemporary scientific institutions, we argue for the importance of developing multi-strategic research in areas such as agriculture. This is needed so that adequate evaluation of the potential risks of large scale applications of technoscience, as well as harm they may have actually occasioned, can be made; and also so that these applications can be rigorously compared with scientifically informed practices, such as agroecology, which are not as problematic for human health and the environment and which explore the regenerative powers of nature itself.","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy of Technology', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'History of Technology']"

Genome editing is a technology utilized to alter endogenous genes. Genome editing also provides an option to induce cardioprotective genes or inhibit genes linked to adverse cardiac remodeling and thus has promise in ameliorating DMCM. Non-coding genes have emerged as novel regulators of cellular signaling and may serve as potential therapeutic targets for DMCM. Specifically, there is a widespread change in the gene expression of fetal cardiac genes and microRNAs, termed genetic reprogramming, that promotes pathological remodeling and contributes to heart failure in diabetes. This genetic reprogramming of both coding and non-coding genes varies with the progression and severity of DMCM. Thus, genetic editing provides a promising option to investigate the role of specific genes/non-coding RNAs in DMCM initiation and progression as well as developing therapeutics to mitigate cardiac remodeling and ameliorate DMCM. This chapter will summarize the research progress in genome editing and DMCM and provide future directions for utilizing genome editing as an approach to prevent and/or treat DMCM.","['Biomedicine', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Genetics and Genomics', 'Physiology']"

Using Palestine as a case study, this chapter examines the category of baladi seeds as a community-generated characterization of population, and one which arguably defies reduction to data. Drawing on quantitative research on farmer participation in informal seed production for wheat in the occupied Palestinian territories (oPt) and oral histories of farmers in the West Bank, this chapter analyzes the relation between participatory plant breeding initiatives, heritage narratives, and international agricultural research in rendering baladi seeds legible for archiving. It considers the multiple technological practices through which these institutions characterize and manage access to cultivated seeds, and how they differently approach problems of standardization, scalability, and variability. Through case studies of national and local seed saving initiatives, it asks, in turn, whether baladi seeds can be reduced to data, how they might be reduced to data, and whether they should be reduced to data.","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy of Science', 'Plant Sciences', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Political correctness has prevented actual scientific inquiry into momentarily “hot” issues through the government takeover of science funding and direction of research.

Historically, Puccinia species have posed a threat to members of the Poaceae plant family; however, recent outbreaks have raised awareness of their destructive nature. This chapter focuses on Puccinia species that have caused epidemics affecting crops that account for half of the global food production. Advances in high-throughput sequencing technology and computational approaches have increased our understanding of virulence evolution in rust fungi and the molecular factors behind disease epidemics. Pioneering research has revealed the first few avirulence ( Avr ) genes from Puccinia species, and novel mechanisms behind the diversification of pathogen populations, which enable the coevolutionary arms race between Puccinia members and their hosts. The majority of Avr genes in Puccinia species remain to be identified and additional research is required to develop a broad picture of the mechanisms these pathogens use for host manipulation. These topics are likely to remain a strong focus for future research; however, the development of high-quality genomic resources is imperative.","['Life Sciences', 'Microbiology', 'Plant Pathology', 'Microbial Genetics and Genomics', 'Plant Physiology', 'Mycology', 'Plant Sciences']"

Plant disease epidemics historically played a significant role in the starvation and displacement of the world population. Despite huge progress made by researchers in managing diseases of staple commodities, the threat level remains very high, as disease-causing organisms adapt to new hosts, become more virulent by changing their genetic makeup, and show increased resistance against fungicide products. The history of blast disease, which affects one of the world’s staple foods, rice, goes back centuries and has been a continual problem for rice production worldwide with the recent inclusion of wheat blast. Extensive studies on the biology, pathogenicity, and population genetics of Maganaporthe oryzae (Synonym: Pyricularia oryzae ), the causal agent of blast disease, have enriched our understanding of the potential threat that this pathogen poses to rice and wheat production, and therefore world food security. Based on host specificity, mating ability, and genetic relatedness, M. oryzae is divided into several subgroups or pathotypes (different crop-adapted lineages). The genome structure of M. oryzae , characterized by instability, parasexual recombination, and the presence of transposon elements, enabling this pathogen to evolve rapidly and jump from one host to another, has raised real concerns for scientists, growers, and food policy makers. All available options such as forecasting and mapping of disease and pathogen race distribution, early and reliable quick diagnostics, biological and chemical control measures, inclusion of cultivars with resistance genes, and development of blast-resistant variety using CRISPR-Cas genome editing should be considered and deployed as a package for successful control of M. oryzae .","['Life Sciences', 'Microbiology', 'Plant Pathology', 'Microbial Genetics and Genomics', 'Plant Physiology', 'Mycology', 'Plant Sciences']"

Global shocks (e.g., war, economic recession, pandemic) can severely disrupt these interconnections and generate cascading consequences across local to global scales. To comprehensively evaluate these consequences, it is crucial to use integrated frameworks that consider multiple interconnections and flows among coupled human and natural systems. Here we use the framework of metacoupling (human–nature interactions within as well as across adjacent and distant systems) to illustrate the effects of major global shocks on the evolution of global interconnectedness between the early 1900s and the 2010s. Based on these results we make a few actionable recommendations to reduce the negative impacts of an ongoing global shock, the COVID-19 pandemic, to promote global sustainability.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Physical Geography', 'Environmental Management', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

Natural biomacromolecular lubricants are essential for maintaining ultra-low coefficients of friction between sliding biological interfaces. However, when the surface lubrication performance of tissues or organs destroys heavily, it will bring friction/shear damage for sliding contact interfaces. Therefore, the application of exogenous biological lubricating materials to improve the lubrication situation of damaged tissue or organ interfaces has attracted extensive attention of researchers. In this review, based on a simple summary of lubrication mechanism at sliding biological interface, we systematically introduce the research progress of several kinds of representatively biolubrication materials, including eye drops, tissue anti-adhesion agents, joint lubricants, and medical device lubricants. Meanwhile, the lubrication mechanism and individual advantage and shortcoming for each of these synthetic exogenous lubricated materials are clarified. Correspondingly, the important lubrication application functionality of these biolubricant materials in typically medical surgery scenes, such as dry eye syndrome, tissue adhesion, arthritis, and interventional medical devices, is discussed. Finally, we look forward to the future development direction of artificial biolubricant materials.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

This polyphony of voices is still little known in European and North American philosophical circles, even though they address the same twentieth- and twenty first-century challenges – challenges which are difficult to deal with without the achievements of science and technology (and techno-scientific systems) and their consequences for the natural world, the human condition and collective life, as well as in terms of new uncertainties in the future. Some of the voices collected here view technology in a world historical period characterised by the twilight of empires, dictatorial domination, the destruction brought about by wars already carried out under industrialized science, the nuclear threat, and propaganda, but also by the winds of decolonization, economic growth driven by the science-technology complex and by big science, the increase in the influence of the media and the birth of the consumer society. Other voices, from a subsequent generation, have experienced a context in which new dilemmas have arisen, associated with the irruption of the techno-sciences, in particular in the domains of biotechnology and information, the continuous expansion of markets, the deep technologization of war, and the acceleration of innovation, generally more technical and commercial than social. Genetic manipulation of human beings, the environmental crisis and climate change, artificial intelligence, the virtualization of social relations, the imaginaries of the subcultures of high technology and their dreams of downloading minds to computers and the cyborgization of the body, among so many other developments associated with techno-science, define the horizon for all those who made the transition into the twenty-first century and have to find answers within it. Philosophical and social thought on technology in the Portuguese language fully incorporates the international discussion of these issues, but there are different nuances and emphases in each of the Portuguese-speaking countries, linked to their specific continents and cultural and social contexts. Clear examples are the question of technological dependence, historical experience (particularly in Latin America and Africa) with the incorporation of Western technology into the social structure of ancestral communities and critical distancing on the inter-penetration of techno-science and economic globalization. But they all offer us thought-provoking reflections for the possible fertile interaction of philosophy and technology.","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy of Technology', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'History of Technology']"

Based on experiences in a large, interdisciplinary research project, the authors rather show how the interdisciplinary of the project changed over time. Drawing on the work of Donna Haraway, Joan Tronto, and Maria Puig de la Bellacasa, interdisciplinarity is explored and conceptualised as a doing of care and an object of care. The authors provide examples of what supported and hampered the doing of such care work. The boundary concept of regulatory ecology advanced both theoretical and methodological development in the project as well as contributed to strengthening relationships and communication within the team. Care work was sometimes hampered by the disciplinary dialects of the participants, which can also result in different interpretations given to metaphors and visualisations. As an object of care, interdisciplinarity requires time for dialogue and critical reflection. The authors show how the disciplinary power of project implementation and deadlines took precedence in the second half of the project, challenging the project’s critical and exploratory edge. Interdisciplinarity needs to be cultivated, to be cared for, which takes time, and which should already be expressed in the project proposal.","['Business and Management', 'Sustainability Management', 'Economic Geography', 'Diversity Management/Women in Business', 'Law and Economics', 'Business Ethics']"

This approach offers an alternative to conventional university entrance criteria, establishing a means to better advice prospect university students on which degree streamline they are best suited for based on their displayed abilities. This will assist in the measures taken to reduce student attrition at universities. Student skill-sets are composed of pre-college marks (high school leaving results and National Benchmark Test scores) and home language. The composition of skill-sets is based on key student abilities associated with student university performance, and these are characterised as follows: mathematical ability, computer proficiency, academic literacy and language communication. The best performing prediction model proved to be the random forest classifier which gave an accuracy of 95%. This research, conducted at a South African research intensive institute, shows that skill-sets can be used as an alternative to current university entrance requirements as they provide a more holistic view of a student’s ability. With the advent of machine learning, this study also demonstrates the capabilities of data mining in education as viable solutions to the student attrition problem with skill-sets giving a more holistic representation of the students capabilities making for better classification predictions.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This chapter opens a small window with some examples that can serve to understand a little bit the trends of some (not all) sectors that are in full expansion all over the world simultaneously, with their pros and cons. There is a need to change the rules of the game, the paradigms to which we have so far been working with. It is not a simple exercise. It needs a lot of will and a deep understanding of what are the limits and dangers of the old model in which we still live immersed. Many examples show that the actual model runs too fast and has a direct impact on natural resources and ecosystem functioning. In this framework, aquaculture is coming under specific scrutiny. We have gone from an almost negligible aquaculture figure in the ‘70s in terms of fisheries production, to almost half of the biomass extracted from the sea and continental waters from this “farming” activity. This is a considerable achievement, but it has its consequences. The impact of monocultures (salmon, shrimp, etc.) has been, in many places, equal to or worse than overfishing. Eutrophication, salinization, introduction of drugs to contain diseases, the use of wild fish to feed mariculture species or the systematic hunting of potential predators (eagles, seals, etc.) are only some of the problems associated with aquaculture nowadays. The impact on wild ecosystems such as mangroves or fjords is very relevant, and has been highlighted as one of the most important problems to be solved in coastal waters. A new vision is that of the Integrated Multitrophic Aquaculture. This is a method that is gaining strength and that may be the change we need, especially if we move from species of high energy and carbon investment (carnivores) to those species that require less energetic effort (such as bivalves, macroalgae, holothurians, etc.). To do this, one of the first things to do is a good forecast of the impact of climate change, selecting the most suitable organisms (and areas) according to the changing environmental conditions. The regional possibilities (i.e., those areas that may be suitable for a mariculture expansion) and the carrying capacity of the surrounding ecosystems according to different areas must also be taken into account if we want a significant paradigm change. Also, the inclusion of stakeholders and clear co-governance roles of these kind of infrastructures has to be understood as a tool to a successful management of the products that will be available for the local people. The Blue Growth related to the mariculture is not the only open front for the future. The use of microalgae is another type of approach to a future in which low-energy cost organisms are gradually taking center stage. The possibilities have a wide spectrum, and now these microorganisms are beginning to be applied industrially in nutraceuticals, biofuels or for the generation of interesting molecules for biomedical applications. The solutions are there, and changing the priorities and the way we apply the different discoveries to be in line with SDG14 in this Blue Growth strategy is a challenge. In fact, it is not all positive prospects in Blue Growth. There are cases in which excessive acceleration of production and inadequate management of “new generation” resources can cause stress on systems, especially in places with fragile ecosystem balances. In addition, considering the production of alternative energies such as offshore wind, or the new planning of maritime traffic, we have to deeply change our way to proceed. The Blue Growth roadmap must change the paradigm if we really want to consider it sustainable. New solutions and new perspectives in a changing world that require spatial planning and a very different model of resource management than the one we are now applying are urgently needed, considering new models of production, economy and social interaction.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"

There is a need to investigate and promote the indigenous and emerging plant resources ( climate smart emerging crops ) which have been neglected by research, policy and decision-makers and consumers, but have the potential to contribute to food and nutrition security, income generation and combat the effects of climate change. This chapter discusses selected climate smart emerging crops : morama bean ( Tylosema esculentum (Burch.) A.Schreib.), mungongo ( Schinziophyton rautanenii (Schinz) Radcl.-Sm.), mosukujane ( Lippia javanica (Burm.f.) Spreng), moringa ( Moringa olifera Lam), Kgengwe ( Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai) and mahupu ( Kalaharituber pfeilii Trappe), with a focus on their unique chemical and medicinal properties, and explores how the indigenous communities have used them towards food security. To contextualize this, research projects that have been carried out in Botswana and Namibia are discussed and the lessons learned highlighted. The success of these projects has been dependent on symbiotic relationship, especially in terms of knowledge sharing, between researchers and communities where the plant species are abundant and used. These communities have demonstrated high levels of indigenous knowledge on conservation, sustainable collection, processing and utilization. It is within this context that appropriation of knowledge related to these climate smart emerging crops , through intellectual property protocols and guidelines, is found to be critical so that these communities can be protected and derive commercial benefits if any. Within the broad aim of promoting these climate smart emerging crops towards food security and food scarcity, there is a need for operational policy framework and strategy on domestication and cultivation of these that could lead to adequate research and development on domestication, cultivation and value chains to improve and promote the production, value adding and marketing of these species.","['Chemistry', 'Food Science', 'Agriculture']"

We consider genetic gain-focused plant breeding strategies that envision a data-intensive mode of breeding in which genomic, environmental and socio-economic data are mobilised for rapid crop variety development. Focusing on socio-economic data linkage, we examine methods of product profiling and how they accommodate gendered dimensions of breeding in the field. Through a comparison with participatory breeding methods, we argue that the conceptual commitments underpinning current methods of integrating socioeconomic data into calculations of genetic gain can preclude the achievement of key social development goals, and that better engagement with participatory approaches can help address this problem. We conclude by identifying three key avenues towards a data-intensive approach to plant breeding that utilises the diverse sources of relevant evidence available, including socio-economic data, and maximises the chance of developing sustainable and responsible strategies and research practices in this domain: (1) reliable, long-term management of data infrastructures; (2) ongoing critical analysis of the conceptual foundations of specific strategies; and (3) regular transdisciplinary consultations including expertise in the social studies of agricultural science as well as participatory breeding techniques.","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy of Science', 'Plant Sciences', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Visual arts have been linked with anatomy for centuries, but typically biomedical science has existed in a utilitarian relationship with art only used as an aid. In this chapter, we discuss the rationale underpinning a cross-disciplinary anatomy and art course and describe our experience of devising activities and assessment that create a stimulating and mutually beneficial environment for visualizing the experience and physicality of the human body. We describe the structure of the course which integrates art and anatomy to train students in the language of anatomy and visual representation, by engaging them in a process of attempting their own visual communication.

Previous studies have shown that different mechanisms are responsible for different subtypes of CP El Niño events (CP-I El Niño and CP-II El Niño). By comparing the evolutions of surface winds, ocean temperatures, and heat budgets of the CP-I El Niño, CP-II El Niño, and 2018/19 El Niño, it is illustrated that the subtropical westerly anomalies in the North Pacific, which led to anomalous convergence of Ekman flow and surface warming in the central equatorial Pacific, played an important role in the 2018/19 El Niño event as well as in the CP-II El Niño. Although the off-equatorial forcing played a vital role, it is found that the equatorial forcing acted as a driving (damping) term in boreal spring (summer) of the 2018/19 El Niño.

The coded language of insects has been effectively decoded and used by Forensic Entomologists in solving homicidal cases. Forensic Entomologist can help to establish the post-mortem interval (PMI) of a body, geographic location of death, site of trauma and if the death has occurred due to poisoning or drug overdose. There are two ways of using insects in solving death cases: (a) Deciphering maggot age and development, (b) Insect faunal succession during different stages of decomposition. Calliphoridae (Blow flies), Sarcophagidae (Flesh flies) and Muscidae (House flies) of order Diptera (true flies) are the predominant species involved in forensic investigations. These flies possess the capability of finding a dead body within minutes following death. The flies immediately oviposit/larviposit on the carcass and larvae hatch within 12–24 h depending upon the temperature of the death scene. The larvae of these flies are voracious feeders and possess the capacity as well as capability to consume a carcass in less than a week. The close association of these immature stages on a carcass, their development rates are tapped by the forensic experts to solve homicidal cases. The carcass during decomposition undergoes rapid physical, chemical and biological changes, and attract varied groups of insects. Certain species prefer the carcass during early period of decomposition, like the true flies, some prefer the dead body during its decay or dry stage (beetles, ants) and some arrive to feed on insects present on the corpse. Therefore, with the knowledge about regional insect fauna, their succession pattern of colonization, the insect assemblage on carrion is used by an expert to calculate the minimum time since death. Besides, different groups of insect species assemblages are found on decomposing carcass in different habitats and environments. Apart from calculating Post-Mortem Interval (PMI), with the knowledge of geographical distribution of insect species, an expert can determine whether the body has been moved from one geographic location to the other. Furthermore, the insect larval forms found on a carcass could be tested for death due to drugs or poisoning as the larvae feed on flesh and accumulate drugs ingested by a deceased person. Forensic Entomology is a fast-emerging field in forensic sciences and has become an added tool in legal investigations in the developed countries. Considering the applicability of this field, it becomes imperative that this branch of forensic sciences should be encouraged, popularized, and recognised in the developing countries as well.","['Life Sciences', 'Zoology']"

The first essay, “The living and the artificial”, gives an account of the convergence of two trends: the production of artificial objects which mimic human behaviour and the artificial programming of human behaviour. Both are outcomes of Western culture and of a conception of the object-world of a transcendent subject. Both move in the direction of an object which is artificially alive and to the artificially mechanised man. This, involving the “materialization of the spirit”, threatens to do away with the “transcendent subject” and annihilate humanity. The second essay, “Towards the new man”, examines the issue of technological domination and the subsequent alteration and decline of values. This “absurd” replacement of models of behaviour by modes of operation, by pseudo-values, by technocracy, by the absence of decision-making and engagement, of post-humanity, raises the prospect of a “new man”, he who will live and consume, a passive and patient being, lacking agency, indecisive, without values. The third essay, “Technique as argument”, reflects on the paradox of our living in a world which is produced by a specific type of “magic” – technique –, but in which at the same time the faith in that magic is profoundly undermined. This is because we no longer believe that the operation of technique is due to the “wisdom” of the “pure science” which sustains it, and also because the potency of the novelty it may bring has been used to maintain the existing structures of a hollowed out civilizational project. Today technique is a mere argument, one which is apparently progressive but in fact conservative. Are we able to read into these three essays of Flusser’s an appeal for a technique which might offer us a true vision of the new?","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy of Technology', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'History of Technology']"

Fortunately, food science offers lucrative prospects and attainable options for both sides of this difficult choice.

The question that weighs on many students, however, is which decision is the best one for them and their professional goals.

However, part of Rojas’s strategy for seeing into the future involves extrapolating on biological invasions that are currently affecting Cuban ecosystems. Extreme versions of real-life invasive animal and plant species that do plague present-day Cuba—mutant clarias , radioactive marabú , genetically enhanced hurones cubanos —populate Rojas’s stories. While projects for controlling invasive species often take on xenophobic or nativist undertones in political and cultural discourse, Rojas pushes for a more nuanced understanding of ecological and technological hybridity. Juxtaposed with the nanobot plague, these references suggest that the lessons learned from Cuba’s relationship with foreign biological species can inform the future incorporation of invasive technologies. With a closer look at the short stories of Chunga Maya , this chapter shows how Rojas’s connecting of current crises to future threats highlights the social potential of Cuban science fiction and its capacity to spark dialogs on ecological, technological, and political issues.","['Literature', 'Latin American/Caribbean Literature', 'Fiction', 'Latin American Cinema and TV', 'Latin American Culture']"

The inclusion of CP reduced the relative crystallinity and structure orderliness of starch in terms of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis. Steady-state shear and oscillation tests showed that the inclusion of CP resulted in an enhanced viscoelastic behavior of dough, implying an increase in the resistance of the dough system to flow and deformation, which caused a decrease in specific volume and softness of bread compared to the control (bread without CP). The large oscillatory amplitude oscillation shear (LAOS) tests indicated that doughs exhibited I behavior (strain thinning). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation further confirmed these findings. Significantly, formulations with 3 and 6 wt% CP not only improved the rheological and structural properties of doughs but also enriched the aroma profile of bread compared to the control. Furthermore, sensory evaluators reported that bread enriched with 6% CP scored highest in appearance, texture, and overall acceptability, meaning a product with a high sensory appeal to consumers. This work provides valuable information for an in-depth study of the relationship between bread quality and the rheological behavior and structural properties of the dough.","['Chemistry', 'Food Science', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general', 'Agriculture', 'Biotechnology']"

The development of technology not only provides conveniences for our social life, but also builds a bridge of communication for global information exchange and trade relations. In addition, the continuous development of the economy and the increase in trade demand also promote further development of technology. After the World War II, the world economy once dipped into a recession. If it had not been for the continuous progress of technology, the world economic order would not have been brought back again on track so promptly from the sluggish situation. In contrast, China has not kept up with previous technological revolutions, but instead the implementation of reform and opening up made China realize the importance of opening up. While actively introducing advanced technologies from developed countries in Europe and America, China also tried to innovate independently.","['Business and Management', 'Business and Management, general', 'Economy-wide Country Studies', 'Sustainable Development', 'Industries']"

The impregnation process and macrostructural and microstructural enzyme action were explored by the laser light backscattering imaging technique and a microscopic study by digital image analysis. Texture was analyzed by a compression assay. The effect of enzyme treatment on antioxidant capacity and sugar content was evaluated and compared to the traditional cooking effect. Image analysis data demonstrated the effectiveness of the impregnation process and enzyme action on plant cell walls. Enzyme-treated samples at the end of the process had lower stiffness values with no fracture point, significantly greater antioxidant capacity and significantly lower total and reducing sugars contents than traditionally cooked pumpkins.

We begin with the seemingly outlandish issue of AI copyright that has rapidly become important due to state-of-the-art AI’s success in generating “creative” art and writing. The central question is whether an AI should be allowed to own its own copyright. Related to the question of copyright is one of regulation. Currently, there is a vigorous debate on both regulation of algorithms, as well as regulation by algorithms, since the latter may yield more objective outcomes. Critics point, however, to the dehumanizing effects of such regulation, and to the fact that such algorithms may not be objective to begin with, since they have been trained on (potentially biased) human-generated data. We also cover the important and mainstream issue of legal regulation of Deepfakes and AI’s “explainability crisis” and conclude the chapter and the book with a note on the rapid convergence of AI with other emerging technologies, such as quantum computing.","['Business and Management', 'IT in Business', 'Industries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Business Strategy/Leadership']"

However, it is impossible to realize on-line quality predetermining for all products by this traditional approach, hence claims and returns often occur, resulting in major economic losses of enterprises. In order to realize the on-line quality predetermining for steel products during manufacturing process, the prediction models of mechanical properties based on deep learning have been proposed in this work. First, the mechanical properties of deep drawing steels were predicted by using LSTM (long short team memory), GRU (gated recurrent unit) network, and GPR (Gaussian process regression) model, and prediction accuracy and learning efficiency for different models were also discussed. Then, on-line re-learning methods for transfer learning models and model parameters were proposed. The experimental results show that not only the prediction accuracy of optimized transfer learning models has been improved, but also predetermining time was shortened to meet real time requirements of on-line property predetermining. The industrial production data of interstitial-free (IF) steel was used to demonstrate that R 2 value of GRU model in training stage reaches more than 0.99, and R 2 value in testing stage is more than 0.96.","['Materials Science', 'Materials Science, general', 'Metallic Materials', 'Characterization and Evaluation of Materials', 'Ceramics, Glass, Composites, Natural Materials', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings']"

The beam theory used herein contains only one governing differential equation involving a single displacement variable. Also, governing equation of the theory has strong similarity to that of nonlocal Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. In this work, the beam bending and free vibration analysis of simply supported micro/nanobeams with rectangular cross-section have been carried out. In case of bending analysis, the deflections of the beams are evaluated by using two methods, namely Navier’s method and by direct integration of the governing differential equation. Similarly, the free vibration analysis of rectangular cross-section has been carried out, and the corresponding frequency characteristic equation is obtained by using Navier’s method. The bending deflections and natural frequencies have been evaluated for the case of beams with different thickness/length ratios and various values of nonlocal parameters. The results for beam deflections and natural frequencies have been presented in the tabular form as well as in the graphical form. Results obtained by using the present beam theory are compared with those of other beam theory results available in the literature. The results for deflection and natural frequencies obtained herein are found to be accurate.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Building Materials', 'Construction Management']"

Surface waters of the lagoon were always slightly oversaturated in CO 2 with respect to the atmosphere with an average pCO 2 value of 496 ± 36 ppmv. Seasonally, subsurface water pCO 2 values were controlled by both temperature and biological/tidal advection effects that compensated each other and resulted in weak annual variations. High-resolution temporal pCO 2 records reveal that the highest fluctuations (192 ppmv) occurred at the tidal/diurnal scale as a result of biological activity, advection from the tidal flat, and porewater pumping that all contributed to water pCO 2 and carbonate chemistry variations. Total alkalinity (TA) versus salinity plots suggest a net production of alkalinity in the lagoon attributed to benthic carbonate dissolution and/or anaerobic degradation of organic matter. We specifically highlighted that for the same salinity range, during flooding, daytime pCO 2 were generally lower than nighttime pCO 2 values because of photosynthesis, whereas during ebbing, daytime pCO 2 were higher than nighttime pCO 2 values because of heating. Waters in the lagoon were a relatively weak CO 2 source to the atmosphere over the year compared to other estuarine and lagoon waters elsewhere, and to sediment-air fluxes measured simultaneously by atmospheric Eddy Covariance (EC) in the Arcachon lagoon. Because of low values and small variations of the air-sea pCO 2 gradient, the variability of fluxes calculated using the piston velocity parameterization was greatly controlled by the wind speed at the diurnal and, to a lesser extent, seasonal time scales. During the emersion, the comparison of these pCO 2 data in the tidal creek with EC fluxes measured 1.8 km away on the tidal flat suggests high heterogeneity in air-sea CO 2 fluxes, both spatially and at short time scales according to the inundation cycle and the wind speed. In addition to tidal pumping when the flat becomes emerged, our data suggest that lateral water movement during the emersion of the flat generates strong spatial heterogeneity in water–air CO 2 flux.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Freshwater & Marine Ecology', 'Environmental Management', 'Coastal Sciences', 'Water and Health']"

As more is learned about the mechanisms whereby these pathogens enter human cells it has become increasingly evident that carbohydrates expressed on the surface of either target cells or the pathogens themselves are essential. Variability in carbohydrate structures as well as the presence of carbohydrate binding receptors (lectins) provides a plethora of potential binding interactions by which infection of cells can occur. Identification of specific lipid- or protein-associated carbohydrates essential for infection provides support for research being done to develop carbohydrate related inhibitors of those interactions. This chapter (1) discusses scenarios for how carbohydrates affect the ability of specific infectious agents to interact with neural cells, (2) gives examples of problems that may result from development of antibodies to carbohydrate antigens found on pathogens that are similar to epitopes expressed on mammalian cells, and (3) provides examples of approaches either in use or under consideration for translational uses of this information.","['Biomedicine', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurochemistry']"

Reproduction is an energetically expensive process for living organisms, and investing in progeny that has little chance of survival is not an effective use of resources. The decision for an organism to invest in its offspring or survival thus requires communication between the conditions in the environment and the germ line. Autophagy provides a potential mechanism for signaling to the germline that conditions require diverting resources for individual survival rather than reproduction. Although typically upregulated in response to cellular stress conditions, basal levels of autophagy can also function as a quality control mechanism that serves to maintain cellular homeostasis in response to developmental cues.

It is associated with chronic disease, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, serious infections, and even an increased prevalence of morbidity and mortality in countries with poor socioeconomic or environmental factors. Adequate food administration is essential to satisfy the main caloric and nutritional demands of humans. The most significant factors seen in the development of protein-energy malnutrition in areas of high incidence, such as underdeveloped countries, are inadequate food and nutrient supplies. It has been well established that one of the strategies to alleviate undernourishment is the biofortification of staple crops. This is because vegetables and plants are significant sources of crucial nutrients for human growth and development. To enhance plant nutrition, recent tactics aim to formulated balanced and diverse diets with acceptable levels of vitamins and minerals that benefit human health. New advances in plant biotechnology and animal productivity could control key enzymes in several metabolic pathways, enriching important nutrients such as iron and vitamins and decreasing the content of disadvantageous compounds such as acrylamide-forming amino acids and phytic acids. Numerous biofortified crops such as rice, maize, and wheat have been created to resolve the problem of nutrition deficiencies. Some examples of these methodologies are genome editing engineered nucleases, transcriptional activator-like effector nucleases, zinc finger nucleases, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and associated Cas9 endonuclease which have been created and widely studied for their application, efficiency, and specificity.","['Biomedicine', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Genetics and Genomics', 'Physiology']"

Increasing atmospheric concentrations of GHGs result in increases of Earth’s temperate through radiative forcing (RF). The CO 2 emissions in OA occur primarily from fossil fuel combustion (i.e., farm machinery use), and by soil and land-use management practices. While fossil fuel-derived CO 2 emissions may be smaller for OA, soil CO 2 emissions may be higher compared to those under nonorganic management based on a limited number of studies. Similarly, differences in soil CH 4 emissions between both systems may be small. Specifically, while upland soils under OA can be stronger sinks for CH 4 (0.09 kg CH 4 -C ha −1 year −1 higher soil uptake in temperate regions compared to nonorganic management), paddy soils under OA may be stronger CH 4 sources compared to nonorganically managed soils but data are scanty. Differences in livestock CH 4 emissions between conventional and OA systems appear to be small. However, soil N 2 O emissions under OA management may be smaller than those under conventional management due to lower inputs of reactive nitrogen (Nr) into OA soils. Otherwise, the more widespread use of leguminous cover crops, manure and slurry, poultry litter, and higher soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in topsoil can also contribute to increased N 2 O emissions at OA farms. Overall, soils under OA may emit 1.05 kg N 2 O-N ha −1 year −1 less than those under nonorganic management with the difference being 0.3 kg N 2 O-N ha −1 year −1 for studies in temperate regions. In conclusion, while there is some evidence that OA contributes less to the increases in atmospheric levels of GHGs, the database on farm emissions of CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O must be improved for more credible comparisons between conventional and OA systems. Therefore, the objectives of this chapter are to describe in detail what processes, and what livestock, soil and land-use management practices contribute to GHG emissions from OA systems, and how those emissions may be reduced.","['Life Sciences', 'Agriculture', 'Climate Change', 'Climate Change/Climate Change Impacts', 'Climate Change Management and Policy']"

We compared phytoplankton assemblages in the Lower Columbia River Estuary (LCRE) during two Pacific MHWs that took place in 2015 and 2019, with observations from 2017, a year with no MHW. These data were paired with environmental data from the summers of 2015–2019 to characterize differences in estuarine conditions during MHWs that promote phytoplankton assemblage transitions and identify HAB-conducive conditions. Bloom densities of HAB taxa, Pseudo-nitzschia spp. (4.16 × 10 6 cells L −1 ) and Gymnodinium catenatum (5.66 × 10 6 cells L −1 ), were noted in the estuary during 2015 and 2019, respectively, 2 years where Pacific MHWs occurred during the summer months. These blooms coincided with estuary temperatures that were 1–2 ℃ above and river discharge volumes 46–48% lower than decadal daily averages. We identified patterns in the densities of several algal taxa associated with MHW-mediated low discharge in the LCRE, such as declines in tychopelagic diatoms and increasing abundance of pelagic marine taxa. We conclude that low river discharge, through extension of saline habitat area and longer residence times, likely contributed to the development of the observed marine HABs in the estuary. MHWs and associated declines in discharge are projected to become more common in the Pacific Northwest with climate change, which may alter late summer phytoplankton assemblages in the LCRE.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Freshwater & Marine Ecology', 'Environmental Management', 'Coastal Sciences', 'Water and Health']"

Strikingly, this absolute beginning is prefaced not only with a foreword and an introduction. Hegel’s logic is, in fact, also situated within a scrutiny that, on the one hand, systematically examines the necessary constituents of an absolute beginning, and, on the other, establishes such a beginning via this examination. The absolute beginning of the logic (logos) is thusly situated in a preface (prologos), which, according to Hegel, has been sublated, when the logic begins. In one aspect however, the prologue to the logic from 1812 differs from the posthumously published edition from 1832. While Hegel in the 1812-logic describes this transition in terms of a necessary exteriorisation (Entäußerung), the transition is furthermore described in terms of a decision and a will (Entschluss) in the 1832-logic. Hegel, the article argues, alters his conception of an absolute beginning after 1812. Consequently, he approaches the question of an absolute beginning in two distinct ways, which, it is further argued, need to be differentiated properly for an adequate understanding of his system and its immediate reception. The article traces and examines these two models of situating being and, thus, self-negating negativity in the logic. By following the historical development of Hegel’s thought in his works and lectures, the article ultimately aims to highlight a crucial aspect of the function and necessity of prologues within classical German philosophy.","['Philosophy', 'German Idealism', 'Continental Philosophy', 'History of Philosophy']"

However, it is apparent that transistor scaling shows signs of saturation, and an introduction of new solutions for energy-efficient computation becomes paramount. The electron spin offers additional functionality to digital switches based on field-effect transistors. SpinFETs and SpinMOSFETs are promising devices, with nonvolatility introduced through the relative magnetization orientation between the ferromagnetic source and drain. Although several fundamental problems including spin injection from metal ferromagnets to a semiconductor, spin propagation and relaxation, as well as spin manipulation by the gate voltage were successfully demonstrated, increasing the magnetoresistance ratio as well as achieving efficient spin control represent the challenges to be resolved. Magnetic tunnel junctions are perfectly suited as key elements of nonvolatile CMOS-compatible magnetoresistive memory. Purely electrically addressable spin-transfer torque and spin-orbit torque magnetoresistive memories are superior compared to flash memories and will compete with DRAM and SRAM. MRAM possesses a simple structure, long retention time, high endurance, and fast operation speed. In addition, a combination of nonvolatile elements with CMOS devices allows to bring close or to even shift data processing capabilities into the nonvolatile segment. This paves the way for a new low-power and high-performance computing paradigm based on logic-in-memory and in-memory computing architectures, where the same nonvolatile elements are used to store and to process the information.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Electronic Circuits and Devices', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation']"

This implies a view of democracy based on deliberative exercise and critical evaluation to arrive at the best possible solution to given problems. As a result, the notion of deliberative teaching has been developed (a type of dialogic teaching) that refers to an organization of the curricular contents around the exercise of argumentative deliberation, that is, promoting a democratic dialogue around genuine curricular controversies that require a collective effort to be resolved by consensus. This type of teaching has empirically shown to benefit political competencies, social cohesion, and impacts in disciplinary concept learning for students. The problem is that global evidence shows that a transmissive and monological pedagogy is still maintained. Thus, we face the challenge of changing pedagogical practices, which directs attention to how teacher professional development programs promote transformations in pedagogical teaching. One of the alternatives for teacher professional development that has shown promising results is the so-called use of “educative curriculum materials.” These cognitive tools have emerged as a crucial option for addressing teacher learning and changing practices. However, despite these empirical benefits, it is also necessary to understand and explore the theoretical assumptions underlying the use of these materials. This chapter aims to explore a theoretical foundation that discusses the cognitivist perspective underlying the use of these materials. Just as we understand dialogic theory to explain student learning through language speech, the functioning of these materials will be explored from this theory that, in turn, explains the role of language involved in these adult learning processes. Finally, the practical implications of these curricular tools are discussed.","['Education', 'International and Comparative Education', 'Education, general']"

Early rodents exhibit a simple brain comparable to other early members of Euarchontoglires including fairly large olfactory bulbs, an exposed midbrain and a small neocortex. The study of rodent endocasts provides a snapshot into the potential for deeper understanding that comes from not only estimating endocranial volume but examining comparative quantitative data for different regions of the endocast. A relationship between locomotor behavior and endocranial shape and size appears to exist in rodents, with arboreality as a potential driver for encephalization, and for neocortical and petrosal lobule expansion, in early Sciuroidea; whereas fossoriality may have led to an opposite pattern, with a reduction in the relative size of these two portions of the brain.","['Life Sciences', 'Evolutionary Biology', 'Paleontology', 'Vertebrates', 'Animal Anatomy / Morphology / Histology']"

This Chapter continues the examination of actual teaching practice in EMI classes by focusing on the Chinese EMI lecturers’ specific engagement strategies. Examining engagement allows this research to respond to two concerns raised in current literature: (i) that expository pedagogy and its aligned instruction will generate less classroom engagement compared to constructivist teaching; and (ii) there is less engagement and interaction in a class when teaching is conducted in EMI. The aim of this Chapter is not to measure the effectiveness of learning in relation to engagement, but rather to capture the characteristics of the engagement strategies implemented by the participants. Data reveal a general pattern in the EMI lecturers’ implementation of engagement strategies: cognitive engagement was the dominant, most frequently used engagement strategy, and conversely, emotional, managerial and behavioral engagement was observed with very limited frequency. The arguments being proposed are that the characteristics of these Chinese EMI lecturers’ engagement strategies are shaped by their pedagogical, educational and cultural ideologies; and that English as the medium plays a secondary role in patterns of engagement observed in this research.","['Education', 'Teaching and Teacher Education', 'Language Education', 'Curriculum Studies', 'International and Comparative Education']"

A DBMS is essential in data collection, storage, retrieval, validation, curation and analysis in plant breeding programs to enhance the ultimate goal of increasing genetic gain. The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), working on the roots, tubers and banana (RTB) crops like cassava, yam, banana and plantain has deployed a FAIR-compliant (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) database; BREEDBASE. The functionalities of this database in data management and analysis have been instrumental in achieving breeding goals.

Several innovative gender responsive approaches and initiatives have identified users and their preferences which have informed improved customer and product profiles. A remaining bottleneck is the effective linking of data on preferences and social information of crop users with technical breeding data to make this process more effective.","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy of Science', 'Plant Sciences', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

These highly polarized cells use their somatodendritic domain to receive and integrate input signals while the axon is responsible for the propagation and transmission of the output signal. However, the axon must perform different functions throughout development before being fully functional for the transmission of information in the form of electrical signals. During the development of the nervous system, axons perform environmental sensing functions, which allow them to navigate through other regions until a final target is reached. Some axons must also establish a regulated contact with other cells before reaching maturity, such as with myelinating glial cells in the case of myelinated axons. Mature axons must then acquire the structural and functional characteristics that allow them to perform their role as part of the information processing and transmitting unit that is the neuron. Finally, in the event of an injury to the nervous system, damaged axons must try to reacquire some of their immature characteristics in a regeneration attempt, which is mostly successful in the PNS but fails in the CNS. Throughout all these steps, glycans perform functions of the outermost importance. Glycans expressed by the axon, as well as by their surrounding environment and contacting cells, encode key information, which is fine-tuned by glycan modifying enzymes and decoded by glycan binding proteins so that the development, guidance, myelination, and electrical transmission functions can be reliably performed. In this chapter, we will provide illustrative examples of how glycans and their binding/transforming proteins code and decode instructive information necessary for fundamental processes in axon physiology.","['Biomedicine', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurochemistry']"
doi:10.1007/s12237-022-01120-7,en,Contrasting Effects of Nitrogen Addition on Leaf Photosynthesis and Respiration in Black Mangrove in North Florida,OriginalPaper,"Nutrient enrichment is a major driver of environmental change in mangrove ecosystems. Yet, nutrient enrichment impacts on physiological processes that regulate CO 2 and water fluxes between mangrove vegetation and the atmosphere remain unclear. We measured peak growing season photosynthesis ( A ) and respiration ( R ) in black mangrove ( Avicennia germinans ) leaves that had been subjected to long-term (8-year) nutrient enrichment (added N, added P, control) in north Florida. Previous results from this site indicated that Avicennia productivity was N-limited, but not P-limited. Thus, we expected that N addition would increase light saturated net photosynthesis at ambient CO 2 ( A net ), intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE), maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylation ( V cmax ), and leaf dark respiration ( R ), while P addition would have little effect on any aspect of photosynthesis or respiration. We expected that increased photosynthesis and respiration would be most apparent immediately after N addition and in newly formed leaves. Indeed, A net and V cmax increased just after N addition in the N addition treatment; these increases were limited to leaves formed just after N addition. Nonetheless, over time, photosynthetic parameters and iWUE were similar across treatments. Interestingly, R measured at 25 °C increased with N addition; this effect was consistent across time points. P addition had little effect on R . Across treatments and time points, V cmax,25 ( V cmax standardized to 25 °C) showed no relationship with R at 25 °C, but the maximum rate of electron transport for RuBP regeneration standardized to 25 °C ( J max,25 ) increased with R at 25 °C. We conclude that N addition may have small, short-lived effects on photosynthetic processes, but sustained effects on leaf R in N-limited mangrove ecosystems.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Freshwater & Marine Ecology', 'Environmental Management', 'Coastal Sciences', 'Water and Health']"

Therefore, understanding the dynamic origins of the NEC spring rainfall (NECSR) variability is of socioeconomic importance. This study reveals an interdecadal change in the atmospheric teleconnections associated with the NECSR during a recent 60-year period (1961–2020). Before the mid-1980s, NECSR had been related to a Rossby wave train that is coupled with extratropical North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST), whereas, since the mid-1980s, NECSR has been linked to a quite different Rossby wave train that is coupled with tropical North Atlantic SST. Both Rossby wave trains could lead to enhanced NECSR through anomalous cyclones over East Asia. The weakening of the westerly jet over North America is found to be mainly responsible for the alternation of the atmospheric teleconnections associated with NECSR during two epochs. 中国东北地区是主要粮食产区, 春季降水对于当地农业生产有着十分重要的影响. 深入理解影响东北春季降水变率的物理过程有着重要社会和经济意义. 本研究发现, 影响东北春季降水的大气遥相关型在近 60 年时段内 (1961-2020) 发生了年代际转变. 在 20 世纪 80 年代中期之前 (后), 东北春季降水主要受到与热带外 (热带) 北大西洋海表温度耦合的、 沿西风急流 (大圆路径) 传播的准定常罗斯贝波影响, 导致东亚地区受到气旋性环流的控制, 水汽输送至东北, 使得春季降水增多. 北美地区上空西风急流减弱是东北春季降水大气遥相关型发生转变的主要原因.","['Earth Sciences', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Meteorology', 'Geophysics/Geodesy']"

The rig-to-reef approach, successfully implemented in other seas of the world, provides an attractive alternative to the complete removal by reefing the underwater oilrig structures and theoretically provides positive environmental, economic, and social benefits to a wide range of stakeholders. This manuscript critically reports and analyzes the risks associated with the implementation of the rig-to-reef approach in Qatar oilfields by using a DPSIR conceptual framework focusing on the pressures, states, impacts, and responses. By portraying reefing approaches as an issue, several pressures were identified including potential navigational safety issue, pollution, and physical disturbances. These pressures are expected to modify the physical, biological, and chemical state of the ecosystems, potentially leading to several impacts, such as the loss of habitats, biodiversity, and associated ecosystem services. The identified hazards and their potential risks were analyzed, and these seemed to be outweighed by the potential benefits of reefing obsolete oil platforms. Nevertheless, the critical impairment to the rig-to-reef implementation, mainly associated to existing regulatory frameworks, should be addressed.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Sustainable Development', 'Development Studies', 'Middle Eastern Politics']"

At the start the chapter we ask: What are the end-user objects and constructs of PCC – for instance as specified by the profession and in legislation? At the end: What decisions about PCC objects and constructs can be made and how reliable are they? Examples and illustrations from PCC have included (i) neuropsychological cases (dealt with in more detail in the accompanying chapter by Melin and Pendrill (Person centered outcome metrology. Springer, 2022)) and (ii) patient participation. In the two central sections of the chapter, assuring the quality of measurement in PCC has obliged consideration of how traditional metrological concepts – particularly metrological references for comparability via traceability and reliable estimates of uncertainty – need to be extended. In providing an overview of the benefits of combining Rasch measurement theory and quality assurance, the unique properties of Rasch Measurement Theory are exploited to the full. Replacing the instrument at the heart of a traditional measurement system with a human being provides a truly “person-centered” model of the metrology. This in turn enables a viable procedure to establish metrological references in fields such as PCC in the form of “recipes” analogous to certified reference materials or procedures in analytical chemistry and materials science. It also informs the measurement uncertainties which determine the final decisions about PCC taken at the end of the chapter.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Health Informatics', 'Psychometrics', 'Health Administration']"

Despite the fact that there are other remediation approaches available, using microorganisms has several advantages, including cost-effectiveness, few or no by-products, and reusability. Microorganisms are readily available, easily defined, highly diverse, widespread, and can feed on a variety of hazardous substances. They may be utilized both in-situ and off-site, and they can clean up a variety of difficult environmental situations. Amid rising pollution levels, many countries do not impose restrictions on industrialization; nonetheless, suitable remedial techniques can be employed to reduce these issues, particularly when microorganisms give beneficial tools for better alternatives. Soil bioremediation is a time-consuming and expensive method that uses bacteria, fungi, and algae to remediate contaminated places to environmentally sustainable conditions. Microorganisms that break down organic compounds, as well as microorganisms that come into touch with contaminants are used in this process. The contaminated soil provides an ideal environment for bacteria to thrive several methods have been developed to assure that the latter two constraints are overcome and that pollutant biodegradation is improved. Bioremediation’s future development may result in a reduction in energy consumption, as well as a reduction in pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. The importance of microorganisms in bioremediation, their advantages over other processes, and the influence of such microscopic organisms on a clean environment will be discussed in this chapter.","['Life Sciences', 'Microbial Ecology', 'Microbiology', 'Environment, general', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology', 'Sustainable Development']"

As a result, analogs have been applied for research not only in the material sciences, such as the development of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), but also for photocatalysts, bioimaging probes, and anticancer reagents. Although a variety of methods for the synthesis and the applications of functionalized cyclometalated iridium complexes have been reported, functional groups are generally introduced to the ligands prior to the complexation with Ir salts. Therefore, it is difficult to introduce thermally unstable functional groups such as peptides and sugars due to the harsh reaction conditions such as the high temperatures used in the complexation with Ir salts. In this review, the functionalization of Ir complexes after the formation of cyclometalated Ir complexes and their biological and material applications are described. These methods are referred to as “post-complexation functionalization (PCF).” In this review, applications of PCF to the design and synthesis of Ir(III) complexes that exhibit blue –red and white color emissions, luminescence pH probes, luminescent probes of cancer cells, compounds that induce cell death in cancer cells, and luminescent complexes that have long emission lifetimes are summarized.","['Chemistry', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Biochemistry, general']"

The evolutionary history of Proboscidea is amongst the best-documented among mammals but knowledge of the group’s paleoneurological history remains comparatively fragmentary. Here, we summarize and build upon more than 150 years of research on the evolution of the proboscidean nervous system. We find that the morphology of the endocranial cast and bony labyrinth of the basal-most proboscideans is consistent with the generalized plesiomorphic conditions for placental mammals (e.g. linearly organized brain parts, low encephalization quotient, presence of a secondary common crus), whereas their conditions become essentially elephant-like in the Elephantimorpha around the Oligocene. This suggests that a higher encephalization quotient and adaptations to low-frequency hearing (e.g. loss of the secondary bony lamina) evolved in parallel with the formation and evolution of a trunk, adaptation to a drier environment, and a higher body mass. We hypothesize that these structures co-evolved as a response to the changing climate in the Oligocene.","['Life Sciences', 'Evolutionary Biology', 'Paleontology', 'Vertebrates', 'Animal Anatomy / Morphology / Histology']"

The development and adoption of common agricultural data standards are key to assuring good stewardship, but face several challenges, including limited awareness about standards compliance; lagging data science capacity; emphasis on data collection rather than reuse; and limited fund allocation for data and standards management. Community-based hurdles around the development and governance of standards and fostering their adoption also abound.

However, their adoption and scaling have consistently been unsatisfactory and sometimes, outright disappointing. Scholars have offered several valuable, insightful, and pertinent contributions to address the above challenge. However, these contributions are in most cases atomistic, transitory, non-spatial, and dispersed. The above state of affairs has left practitioners in limbo as to where and when to apply which insights to what type of digital health intervention and in which context. In this article, a new holistic and integrated theoretical framework, specifically focusing on remote patients’ health management tools and systems (RPMTSs) used to engage patients and potential patients at distance or away from healthcare facilities is proposed and introduced to address the above existing fragmentation and gaps. The new framework demonstrates how a clear and holistic understanding of “adoption” and “scaling” processes in the context of a given type and nature of digital health intervention along with an adaptive complex, processual and systems thinking approach can help confront the complexity of the healthcare apparatus while at the same time responding to its constantly evolving, dynamic nature with “agents” who may sometimes act irrationally or behave in unpredictable ways. In the process, a new framework is added to the knowledge base to guide and support the adoption and scaling of RPMTSs.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-19467-2_1,en,A Comprehensive Overview of SDG 14: Life Below Water_Final,OriginalPaper,"An important part of the health of the oceans depends on a good balance of the biogeochemical cycles. Both climate change (in its broadest sense, from the warming of the oceans to acidification) and the introduction of excess nutrients or heavy metals have caused, in many places, distortions in the balances between chemical elements, organisms and detritus. A series of scenarios have been created in which the excess or absence of certain components are distorting carbon fluxes or biomass accumulation. Such changes are not new at all, but now are accelerating and we have to be ready to understand and manage the repercussions that they may have locally and globally. An increase in nitrogen and phosphorus due to land changes in the Amazon, together with other local phenomena, are promoting an uncontrolled increase in Sargassum , which moves every year with the currents until it invades the Caribbean coast, for example. There is such inertia in the entry of these nutrients into the ocean that it becomes difficult to manage them, and even in areas where there is already a much more exhaustive control of the agricultural or industrial activities that promote them, the proliferation of micro and macro algae seems unstoppable. The microbial composition and also the seasonality are key points that have to be considered, especially when certain physical phenomena are weakened such as upwelling (and the related nutrient supply) or the ocean currents (and the related nutrient transport). Several models are based not only on temperature changes (which affect the availability of macro and micronutrients) but also on coastal morphology and local current dynamics. Such models are complex but very useful to understand, locally, what may happen with a cascade effect, such as the relationship of biogeochemical cycles with primary productivity and, in turn, with biomass production. Climate change is greatly affecting this nutrient availability, not only because the physical-chemical balance may be changing, but also because the organisms that process these nutrients are also changing and their ability to recycle may be affected. Acidification also enters this equation, which makes some microelements less available, or makes some species (for example, coccolithophorids) less capable of completing their life cycles, compete for nutrients or suffer more predation because they have more fragile structures. Latitude must also be taken into account in these changes, both due to the effects of climate change and the direct impacts of human activities that have profoundly transformed many ocean environments. In certain areas the predominance of the impact on biogeochemical cycle comes from the direct action of humans (e.g. fertilizers, farming, etc.), but in others the predominance comes from the warming or acidifying effect due to climate change. Thus, for example, the most accelerated changes in the Arctic are having very rapid effects on these biogeochemical cycles, both due to the increase in temperature and acidification and also due to the fact that the dynamics and coverage of the ice are changing. In this area, the direct impacts by pollution and eutrophication are replaced by climate change accelerating paths. Associated with these changes in nutrient cycles is the decrease in available oxygen that alters the physiological capacities of some organisms. The increase in temperature, the decrease in primary production and the slowdown in currents in various parts of the planet are affecting the response capacity of organisms, from benthic to pelagic. No less important is also the fact that stormy phenomena of different types are increasing in frequency and intensity. Storms and hurricanes are also responsible for the distortion of biogeochemical cycles, in some cases impoverishing biomass production and its quality for the following trophic levels. It is a very complex scenario in which the physiology and adaptability of many organisms is at stake, and which we will have to understand in order to properly manage marine resources in the near future.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-17215-1_1,en,Introduction to Organic Agriculture,OriginalPaper,"Increasing concerns regarding the status of the environment and food quality contribute to an increasing demand for agricultural products produced by organic agriculture (OA). About 1.6% of the global agricultural land area is currently managed by OA practices. In the twentieth century, pioneers such as Rudolf Steiner, Sir Albert Howard, Lady Eve Balfour, Jerome Irving Rodale and Masanobu Fukuoka developed OA systems in reaction to perceived failures of conventional or nonorganic agriculture. Early types of OA included bio-dynamic, natural, biological, ecological and organic-biological agriculture. The International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) provides a definition of modern OA. However, there is no single interpretation of what OA practices and principles entail, and OA production systems continue to evolve. Among common OA practices are fertilization with organic instead of mineral fertilizers, use of natural-derived instead of synthetic plant protection products, and mechanical instead of chemical crop system management. Importantly, OA is the only farming system whose management practices are codified by law in most countries. However, OA is faced with several challenges such as the 19–25% lower crop yield compared to that under conventional or nonorganic practices, the lack of animal and green manure produced on OA farms to satisfy the demand at other OA farms, and lack of plant and animal varieties specifically adapted to OA soil and land-use management practices. Increased efforts are, thus, needed to improve the contribution of OA systems to environmental health as consumer demand for OA products continues to rise globally.","['Life Sciences', 'Agriculture', 'Climate Change', 'Climate Change/Climate Change Impacts', 'Climate Change Management and Policy']"

One example is a lifesaving respiratory device launched in about 10 days (Mercedes F1 team’s new device based on continuous positive airway pressure devices) and rapidly approved by international agencies responsible for assuring drug and medical devices safety, in response to the COVID-19 burden. Remarkably, it is the first time in history that mankind observes disease spread reaching such high proportions, globally, in such short time scale. However, while this epidemic had, in March 2020, reached the critical figures of about 38,000 deaths and c. 738,000 infected, organ donation and transplantation patients are suffering for years, accounting for an increasing number of affected, annually. These patients are invisible for the general public. Therefore, this chapter approaches the organ donation and transplantation burden, proposing effective solutions to leverage the suffering, improving life quality of patients enduring several underlying issues, from hemodialysis complications and critical organ failure to lacking compatible donors. This, on the basis of technology repurposing, to speed up approval processes followed by international agencies responsible for assuring drug and medical devices safety, while adding innovative methods to existing technology and reducing invasiveness.","['Life Sciences', 'Biological Techniques', 'Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences/Technology']"

RNA aptamers are single-stranded nucleic acids that can adopt different conformations and specifically recognize a wide range of ligands, making them good candidates to develop biosensors of small molecules. Recently, light-up RNA aptamers have been introduced and used as starting building blocks of RNA-based fluorogenic biosensors. They are typically made of three domains: a reporter domain (a light-up aptamer), connected to a sensor domain (another aptamer) via a communication module. The latter is instrumental as being in charge of information transmission between the sensor and the reporting domains. Here we present an ultrahigh-throughput screening procedure to develop RNA-based fluorogenic biosensors by selecting optimized communication modules through an exhaustive functional exploration of every possible sequence permutation using droplet-based microfluidics and next-generation sequencing.","['Chemistry', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general', 'Biomaterials', 'Biological Techniques']"

Spread across relevant fields of study are multiple, competing approaches to describing, theorizing, and studying emotions. This chapter represents a preliminary foray into the scholarship on emotions in postsecondary teaching and learning. In this chapter, I identify some of the complications involved in exploring emotions in postsecondary settings and describe two broad approaches to conceptualizing emotions. In addition to reviewing research focused primarily on students’ emotional experiences, I consider studies that describe the role of teachers and pedagogies in relation to students’ emotions. After discussing how emotions are conceptualized and investigated in this literature, I consider the implications for future explorations of emotions in postsecondary teaching and learning. Ultimately, this chapter illuminates the complexity of inquiry into emotions while offering suggestions for research that recognizes the potential of emotions—and inquiry around emotions—to disrupt inequalities in higher education.","['Education', 'Higher Education', 'Educational Policy and Politics', 'Administration, Organization and Leadership', 'Sociology of Education', 'Curriculum Studies']"

It is known that infragravity wave propagation into these estuaries can induce strong currents and that closures lead to stagnating flows and declining water quality; however, how the estuarine circulation (tidal and subtidal) dynamically drives and responds to these conditions remains largely unknown. Here we analyze over 4 years of hydrodynamic observations in Los Peñasquitos Lagoon, a low-inflow, intermittently closed estuary in Southern California, to examine wave propagation into the estuary, sill accretion, and the estuarine circulation response over tidal, fortnightly, seasonal, and interannual time scales, providing an unprecedented view as to how these systems respond to changing forcing. Wave observations near the estuary inlet show that wave energy inside the inlet, which contributes to sill accretion, is dependent on water level relative to the sill height and has a tidal variation due to wave-current interactions. Tidal phase averages of conditions during open, pre-closure, spring, neap, and closed conditions highlight the large dynamic range that these estuaries experience. During open, low sill conditions, circulation and stratification are consistent with stratification-induced periodic straining and subtidal exchange varies with the fortnightly cycle as observed in many classical estuaries. However, as the sill grows, tidal circulation weakens and becomes strongly sheared and the subtidal exchange no longer scales with a classical theoretical pressure-friction balance.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Freshwater & Marine Ecology', 'Environmental Management', 'Coastal Sciences', 'Water and Health']"

This research develops the idea of an interconnected progressive development of science and technology, manifested in the constant impact of scientific discoveries and inventions on the level of development and use of human resources. The subject of this study defines scientific and technological progress as a complex category that has a functional organization in the structure of social reproduction. The authors highlight the fundamental characteristics of such a phenomenon as scientific and technological progress, pointing to its close relationship with the improvement of human resources, productive forces in general. These characteristics are interconnection and interdependence, because scientific and technological progress today is the main prerequisite for the development of human resources. The research is based on the position that the laws of technology development should be considered from the perspective of changing the structure of society’s needs, improving productive forces, changing factors of economic modernization, as well as industrial relations at various levels of society’s evolution. The authors substantiate the idea that today the progressive development of social and economic spheres is inseparable from the materialization of scientific and technological achievements, innovations. The results presented in the article can be used in forecasting technological trends, in the development of scientific and technical policy. The main provisions of the article may be in demand for the purposes of further theoretical and methodological substantiation and practical research on the problems of formation and development of human resources. The authors believe the fact that the modern mechanism of human resource management will be effective if it is based on the systemic interaction of scientific and technological progress, innovative processes and other factors described in the article.

The purpose of this work is to study the influence of C additions on the tribological behavior of a magnetron-sputtered TiN film in air, water, and seawater. The results show that the addition of C into the TiN binary film induced a new amorphous phase, and the films exhibited a dual phase of fcc (face-centered cubic)-TiN and amorphous carbon. The antifriction and wear-resistance properties were enhanced in air and water by adding 19.1at% C. However, a further increase in the C concentration improved anti-frictional properties but also led to higher wear rates. Although the amorphous phase induced microbatteries and accelerated the corrosion of TiN phases in seawater, the negative abrasion state was detected for all Ti—C—N films due to the adhesion of the tribocorrosion debris on the wear track.","['Materials Science', 'Materials Science, general', 'Metallic Materials', 'Characterization and Evaluation of Materials', 'Ceramics, Glass, Composites, Natural Materials', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings']"

They are major medical causes of illness. Bacteria may seem to be relatively simple forms of life, yet they are really rather complicated and highly adaptable. Numerous bacteria proliferate fast, and different species may use a wide variety of hydrocarbon substrates, including phenol, rubber, and petroleum. There are several dependent and free-living species of these organisms. They may take the form of rods, cocci, helical forms, and even filaments with branching structures. Despite structural diversity, the bulk of bacteria vary from 0.5 pm to 5 pm in length. Through the employment of flagella, motile bacteria can traverse liquid media. Although bacterial fossils exist in the form of stromatolites, their lack of distinguishing form prevents them from being used to investigate the history of bacterial evolution or to date the origin of certain bacterial species. Prokaryotic cells lack membrane-bound cytoplasmic compartments and have a nucleoid instead of a nucleus sheath. Many tasks performed by membranous organelles in eukaryotes are done by the plasma membrane in prokaryotes. Multiplication is performed using binary fission. The taxonomy of prokaryotes is described in the second book of Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. Bergey’s Manual classifies prokaryotes into bacteria and archaea domains. Each domain is made up of phyla. Remember that the categorization is based on similarities in rRNA gene sequences. The classification of classes into orders and then species. The host–pathogen relationship may also influence the kind of tissue response and the infectious agent’s spread to other animals. Cattle with a strong cell-mediated immune response to Mycobacterium bovis infection may continue to be chronically infected, with organisms persisting in isolated foci without shedding. In instances of chronic cow mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, repeated shedding is possible. Salmonella Dublin may cause a prolonged infection in the gallbladder of bovines by releasing faeces intermittently in response to stress.","['Materials Science', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nanoscale Science and Technology', 'Materials Science, general', 'Immunology', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Veterinary Microbiology, Parasitology and Infectious Diseases']"

Historians have made impressive progress applying this lens to curricula, extracurricular activities, college regulations, differential treatment of students, students’ enactments of femininity and masculinity, and the impact of a gendered faculty labor market. Two related themes also appear: women and intersectionality. Regarding women, robust exploration continues, featuring two arguments: commitments to women’s needs were seldom paramount in collegiate decision-making, and historians increasingly see women’s activism as only part of a larger story about markets and institutional self-interest. Regarding intersectionality, greater awareness that overlapping identities affect experience has expanded studies of different groups of students and faculty. Overall, historians have made most progress examining women’s participation, LGBTQ students and faculty, and intersections of higher education with race. Less progress appears around religion, class, and the impact of policy. The field would benefit from additional attention to racial identities beyond white and Black women, to transgender individuals, to campus staff beyond faculty, and to use of theory.","['Education', 'Higher Education', 'Educational Policy and Politics', 'Administration, Organization and Leadership', 'Sociology of Education', 'Curriculum Studies']"

The daunting challenge is, however, how to sustainably provide food for a world of ~9 billion people in 2050 with ~6.5 billion of these people living in urban areas without exacerbating the climate crisis. Urban agriculture (UA) can provide some of the fruit and vegetables consumed by urban dwellers but cereal and livestock production depend on a significant external non-urban area. Some of the UA practices can be combined with those of organic agriculture (OA) but effects of this combination on the climate are uncertain. New modes of production such as rooftop farming and vertical indoor farming including soilless practices and hydroponics have also been introduced in UA. If more food can be grown in urban areas, the pressure on converting non-agricultural land for agriculture and its associated climate impact can be reduced. Overall, rather than adhering to a fixed set of principles such as those associated with OA, regenerative agriculture (RA), agroecology or conservation agriculture (CA), site-specific soil and land-use management practices for more sustainable and climate-friendly and -resilient agriculture and food systems must be developed and studied in collaboration with farmers, ranchers and land managers on experimental fields and on working lands. Financial incentives are needed to reward the implementation of site-specific practices such as those associated with carbon farming as a service to society while at the same time producing more sustainable and climate-positive food.","['Life Sciences', 'Agriculture', 'Climate Change', 'Climate Change/Climate Change Impacts', 'Climate Change Management and Policy']"

Early stem-mammal evolution mostly involved enhanced integration of skeletal elements for feeding and locomotion as they became apex predators. With the origin of Cynodontia , modifications of the dentition, oropharynx, and braincase suggest that mastication and olfaction had become major influences in stem-mammal evolution, probably through ontogenetic cascades triggered by expression of an expanded olfactory genome. With the origin of Mammaliaformes , brain size nearly doubled in response to further elaboration of the olfactory system, dentition, the elaboration of hair, all in the context of miniaturization of adult body size. One of the keys to understanding major features in stem-mammal evolution and the origin of Mammalia is the emergence of an unsurpassed ability to perceive and process olfactory and dietary information, and to diversify and exploit the fast-changing chemical environments they faced throughout much of their history. Whether through connectional invasions and epigenetic population matching, or some other developmental mechanism, hypertrophy in peripheral sensory arrays produced cascading influences on central organization. These led to emergence of the unique mammalian neocortex and to the physiological and behavioral repertoires that are so distinctive of mammals today.","['Life Sciences', 'Evolutionary Biology', 'Paleontology', 'Vertebrates', 'Animal Anatomy / Morphology / Histology']"

Sharing data with data analyst introduces the risk of privacy for individuals whose sensitive information is present in the shared data. Privacy is the right of an individual, so it needs to be maintained while sharing the data with a third party. There are many privacy-preserving algorithms available. k-anonymization is one of the most popular and traditional privacy-preserving methods. It modifies data to protect an individual's sensitive information by disconnecting the link between an individual and its sensitive information. k-anonymization uses generalization and suppression tools to anonymize the data. Generalization replaces specific values of attributes with general values, and suppression deletes unmatched values of attributes. There are many existing single table anonymization algorithms. The proposed work presents how a single table anonymization algorithm can be applied on multi-relation dataset. It also discusses the problems encountered when single table anonymization algorithms are used for the multi-relation dataset.

The fracture toughness can be quantified for individual phases, including the ITZ phase between the unreacted grain and the surrounding hydrate. A linear relationship exists between the macro fracture properties of the paste and the micro fracture properties of the ITZ and the hydrates phases.

They provide medical and industrial products, and are even consumed as food. In agroecosystems, insects perform functions, like pollination, nutrient and energy cycling, pest suppression, seed dispersal, and decomposition of organic matter, feces, and carrion. In terms of money, the ecosystem services provided by insects have an estimated value of US dollar 57 billion per year in the United States alone, and insect pollination may have an economic value of US dollar 235–577 billion per year worldwide. Despite their wide ecological significance, very little information is available on the functional roles that insects play and the ecosystem services they provide.

doi:10.1007/s12237-022-01100-x,en,Relations Between Abiotic and Biotic Environmental Variables and Occupancy of Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) in Autumn,OriginalPaper,"There is much debate about the extent to which water management in the upper San Francisco Estuary, California, affects the habitat and status of delta smelt ( Hypomesus transpacificus ), an endemic fish protected under the US and California Endangered Species Acts. For example, current management reflects the hypothesis that salinity, and in some cases the location of the tidally averaged salinity of 2 parts per thousand (X2), is a reliable indication of habitat quality. We evaluated hypotheses about environmental drivers of the quality of delta smelt habitat (probability of occupancy) during autumn that were developed by experts on the species and estuary. We fit Bayesian occupancy models, which account for imperfect detection, and identified those that best predicted the presence of delta smelt in catch data from 1980 to 2015. The most strongly supported model indicated that occupancy was associated with salinity (measured as specific conductance) and temperature, and detection was associated with body size, sample volume, water clarity, and tidal stage. The second most strongly supported model indicated that occupancy was associated with the abundance of a hypothesized competitor, threadfin shad ( Dorosoma petenense ), an expert-elicited index of predation intensity, and water clarity, and detection was associated with body size, sample volume, water clarity, and time of day. Our results suggested that clarity did not affect occupancy, but affected finer-resolution processes of local presence and detection at sampling stations. Spatial patterns in occupancy were consistent in wet and dry years, suggesting that management on the basis of salinity oversimplifies estimation of habitat quantity and quality.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Freshwater & Marine Ecology', 'Environmental Management', 'Coastal Sciences', 'Water and Health']"

Cortical (c)TECs, present in the cortex, are essential for early thymocyte development including selection of thymocytes expressing functional TCRs (positive selection). Medullary (m)TECs, located in the medulla, play a key role in late thymocyte development, including depletion of self-reactive T cells (negative selection) and selection of regulatory T cells. In recent years, transcriptomic analysis by single-cell (sc)RNA sequencing (Seq) has revealed TEC heterogeneity previously masked by population-level RNA-Seq or phenotypic studies. We summarize the discoveries made possible by scRNA-Seq, including the identification of novel mTEC subsets, advances in understanding mTEC promiscuous gene expression, and TEC alterations from embryonic to adult stages. Whereas pseudotime analyses of scRNA-Seq data can suggest relationships between TEC subsets, experimental methods such as lineage tracing and reaggregate thymic organ culture (RTOC) are required to test these hypotheses. Lineage tracing – namely, of β5t or Aire expressing cells – has exposed progenitor and parent-daughter cellular relationships within TEC.","['Biomedicine', 'Immunology', 'Cancer Research']"

Estuaries provide an essential habitat primarily as nurseries for elasmobranchs. The present study investigates the feeding preferences of megabenthic predatory elasmobranchs from Caranzalem Bay, Goa. The elasmobranchs in this habitat were represented by guitarfishes, Glaucostegus granulatus and Glaucostegus obtusus ; rays, Brevitrygon walga , Pastinachus sephen , Neotrygon kuhlii , and Maculabatis gerrardi ; and bamboo sharks, Chiloscyllium griseum and Chiloscyllium spp. Crustaceans were the major prey of these predators followed by teleosts and cephalopods. The bamboo shark was an opportunistic predator while rays and guitarfish were specialised feeders on penaeid shrimps. Indices suggest that bamboo sharks occupy the highest trophic level in this benthic food chain while guitarfishes and rays function as mesopredators. Ontogenetic dietary changes were observed in all predators, indicating the feeding niche segregation among size classes. Low resource overlap was observed between and within species probably due to high prey availability in the bay. These elasmobranch species frequently occur in bycatch, which can negatively affect their populations and thereby impact the lower trophic strata resulting in large-scale ecological repercussions.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Freshwater & Marine Ecology', 'Environmental Management', 'Coastal Sciences', 'Water and Health']"

A review of the endocranial morphology of notoungulates is here provided, concerning the braincast, the auditory region and other intracranial spaces associated to the caudal vasculature (e.g. internal carotid artery and dural sinuses), whose study have been notably stimulated by the CT scanning techniques. A bulged temporal lobe, the presence of an oblique sulcus (suprasylvian sulcus), and the position of the rhinal fissure roughly differentiate the notoungulate braincast from that of other SANUs. Within the order, braincasts range from almost lissencephalic and comparatively reduced in height (e.g. Notostylops murinus ), to convoluted, anteriorly wide and dorsoventrally more developed (e.g. later diverging toxodonts). Concerning the relative brain size, and pending a precise assessment of the brain size/body size allometry for notoungulates, no evidence of marked increase during the late Eocene-Pleistocene lapse emerges from the data. Additionally, inferences on sensory capabilities are discussed based on the size of the olfactory bulbs, piriform and temporal lobes, and dimensions of the osseous labyrinth. Despite improvements in knowledge during the last two decades on most of the above-mentioned topics, there is still much work to be done on such an iconic group of SANUs.","['Life Sciences', 'Evolutionary Biology', 'Paleontology', 'Vertebrates', 'Animal Anatomy / Morphology / Histology']"
doi:10.1007/978-1-0716-2663-4_4,en,An Introduction to the Stickers-and-Spacers Framework as Applied to Biomolecular Condensates,OriginalPaper,"Cellular organization is determined by a combination of membrane-bound and membrane-less biomolecular assemblies that range from clusters of tens of molecules to micrometer-sized cellular bodies. Over the last decade, membrane-less assemblies have come to be referred to as biomolecular condensates, reflecting their ability to condense specific molecules with respect to the remainder of the cell. In many cases, the physics of phase transitions provides a conceptual framework and a mathematical toolkit to describe the assembly, maintenance, and dissolution of biomolecular condensates. Among the various quantitative and qualitative models applied to understand intracellular phase transitions, the stickers-and-spacers framework offers an intuitive yet rigorous means to map biomolecular sequences and structure to the driving forces needed for higher-order assembly. This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts behind the stickers-and-spacers model, considers its application to different biological systems, and discusses limitations and misconceptions around the model.","['Life Sciences', 'Biochemistry, general', 'Bioinformatics']"

Many reasons can be pointed out for this, some of which related to the abstract nature of these subjects and the lack of previous related knowledge by the students. In this paper we tackle this challenge using gamification in the teaching/learning process, with two main goals in mind. The first is to increase the intrinsic motivation of students to learn, by making the whole process more fun, enjoyable and competitive. The second is to facilitate the learning process by providing intuitive tools for the visualization of data structures and algorithmic output, together with a tool for automated assessment that decreases the dependence on the teacher and allows them to work more autonomously. We validated this approach over the course of three academic years in a Computer Science degree of the Polytechnic of Porto, Portugal, through the use of a questionnaire. Results show that the effects of using games and game elements have a generally positive effect on motivation and on the overall learning process.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The change of the values can be modeled with differential equations. Roughly speaking, a typical differential equation in finance has two components, one deterministic (e.g., rate of interest of bank accounts) and one stochastic (e.g., values of stocks) that is often related to the notion of Brownian motions. The solution of such a differential equation needs the evaluation of Riemann–Stieltjes’s integrals for the deterministic part and Ito’s integrals for the stochastic part. For A few types of such differential equations, it is possible to determine an exact solution, e.g., a geometric Brownian motion. On the other side for almost all stochastic differential equations we can only provide approximations of a solution. We present some numerical methods for solving stochastic differential equations.","['Economics', 'Health Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences/Technology', 'Economics, general', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Biotechnology', 'Economic Theory/Quantitative Economics/Mathematical Methods']"

Normativity emerges along with these roles: parts are obligated to perform their functions and prohibited from violating them. Self-regenerating systems evolve into living cells. Later universes contain increasingly complex forms of life that strive to obey increasingly sophisticated axiological laws. These laws are objective and necessary.

Fossils have been sought by the rich and famous since the advent of colonialism, propelling development in the field of palaeontology but also in how fossils make their way through various, sometimes illegal, corridors to end up in museums and collections across the world. As demand for fossils increased in the nineteenth century, so did commercial avenues for these objects that were being sold not only to private individuals but also to scientific institutions. The most complete and visually impressive fossils in terms of size or uniqueness determine the market value of these fossils with some selling for millions of United States dollars. This has also led to the tampering or forging of fossils by many dealers in an attempt to inflate prices. While fossil crimes have been prevalent for centuries, the legal frameworks within which these crimes can be controlled or stopped are regularly challenged or even circumvented not only due to the lack of enforcements of these regulations but also due to how paleontological objects are classified in the first place as well as other legal loopholes.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Cultural Heritage', 'Archaeology', 'Organized Crime']"

These corresponding shifts emerge from shared roots in cognitive processes common across the sciences and they point toward new opportunities for an art and science of living complex adaptive systems. The psychology of model-based reasoning sets the stage for not just a new consensus on measurement and uncertainty Uncertainty , and not just for a new valuation of the scientific status of psychology and the social sciences, but for an appreciation of how to harness the energy of self-organizing processes in ways that harmonize human relationships.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Education, general', 'Psychometrics', 'Applied Statistics']"

When supported by sufficiently advanced artificial intelligence (AI)-based tutoring software, such environments may facilitate asynchronous, embodied learning approaches for learning hard, procedural skills in industrial settings – addressing timeliness, accuracy, and scalability issues common in the industry. This chapter reflects on the pedagogical setting of immersive virtual reality-based hard skills training guided by an AI tutor software agent. We examine the interfacing of traditional intelligent tutoring system (ITS) software with an immersive virtual environment. Further, we suggest the philosophies of embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended (4E) cognition as a way to fully consider learner epistemology in a virtual world and to account for and make full use of the unique opportunities afforded by the synthetic nature of the immersive virtual learning environment. To explore possibilities for improved pedagogical approaches, we project the 4E cognition approach into the abovementioned learning context and outline a theoretical framework for a VR-native AI tutor. We then propose VR-native pedagogical principles for such as framework that could inform follow-on research.","['Psychology', 'Psychology, general', 'Computer Applications', 'Education, general', 'Philosophy of Mind', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This is a follow-up to the “Promoting AI Literacy through AI-Robotics” [ 1 ] presented at the SITE 2021 conference. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is influencing practically every aspect of our lives as it has rapidly been developed to increase its complexities. Children are not an exception.

There have been several AI-tools focusing on teaching students about AI developed and used in education settings. However, how deep their understanding of AI becomes one of the remaining questions. This paper explores and reports how using Teachable Machine, one of the AI-tools, with a robotic tool deepens the understanding of AI among students. Two pilot studies using Teachable Machine and AI-Robotics tool are explained and how the process that a group of undergraduate students went through in developing AI-powered educational robotics lessons helped them deepen their own understanding of machine learning and its application in physical computing is reported.","['Engineering', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Robotics', 'Computational Intelligence']"
