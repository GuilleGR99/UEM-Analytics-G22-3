doi:10.1007/s42064-022-0144-2,en,A review of dynamic analysis on space solar power station,"['ReviewPaper', 'Review Article']","The concept of a space solar power station (SSPS) was proposed in 1968 as a potential approach for solving the energy crisis. In the past 50 years, several structural concepts have been proposed, but none have been sent into orbit. One of the main challenges of the SSPS is dynamic behavior prediction, which can supply the necessary information for control strategy design. The ultra-large size of the SSPS causes difficulties in its dynamic analysis, such as the ultra-low vibration frequency and large flexibility. In this paper, four approaches for the numerical analysis of the dynamic problems associated with the SSPS are reviewed: the finite element, absolute nodal coordinate, floating frame formulation, and structure-preserving methods. Both the merits and shortcomings of the above four approaches are introduced when they are employed in dynamic problems associated with the SSPS. Synthesizing the merits of the aforementioned four approaches, we believe that embedding the structure-preserving method into finite element software may be an effective way to perform a numerical analysis of the dynamic problems associated with the SSPS.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

Herein, an angles-only navigation algorithm with multisensor data fusion is proposed to derive the relative motion states between two noncooperative spacecraft. First, the design model of the proposed algorithm is introduced, including the derivation of the state propagation and measurement equations. Subsequently, models for the sensor and actuator are introduced, and the effects of various factors on the sensors and actuators are considered. The square-root unscented Kalman filter is used to design the angles-only navigation filtering scheme. Additionally, the Clohessy—Wiltshire terminal guidance algorithm is introduced to obtain the theoretical relative motion trajectories during the rendezvous operations of two noncooperative spacecraft. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed angles-only navigation algorithm is verified using a semi-physical simulation platform. The results prove that an optical navigation camera combined with average accelerometers and occasional orbital maneuvers is feasible for spacecraft noncooperative rendezvous using angles-only navigation.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

This is analyzed in this work with a novel method that combines the definition of a suitable homotopy with a classical perturbation approach, in which the low thrust is assumed to be a perturbation of the nominal Keplerian motion. The homotopy perturbation method provides the analytical (approximate) solution of the dynamical equations in polar form to estimate the corresponding spacecraft propelled trajectory with a short computational time. The accuracy of the analytical results was tested in an orbital-targeting mission scenario.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

Examples refer to coastal engineering applications as well as geotechnical or biomedical applications. Albeit the frequent applications, slight inconsistencies in the formulation of the governing equations can be found in the literature. The main goal of this paper is to identify these differences and provide a quantitative assessment of different approaches. Following a review of the different formulations, simulation results obtained from three alternative formulations are compared with experimental and numerical data. Results obtained by 2D and 3D test cases indicate that the predictive differences returned by the different formulations remain small for most applications, in particular for small porous Reynolds number Re P < 5000. Thus it seems justified to select a simplified formulation that supports an efficient algorithm and coding structure in a computational fluid dynamics environment. An estimated accuracy depending on the porous Reynolds number or the mean grain diameter is given for the simplified formulation.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

To deal with this issue, a feasible attitude trajectory generation method is proposed that utilizes a multiresolution technique and local attitude node adjustment to obtain sufficient time and quaternion nodes to satisfy the pointing constraints. These nodes are further used to calculate the continuous attitude trajectory based on quaternion polynomial interpolation and the inverse dynamics method. Then, the characteristic parameters of these nodes are extracted to transform the path-planning problem into a parameter optimization problem aimed at minimizing energy consumption. This problem is solved by an improved hierarchical optimization algorithm, in which an adaptive parameter-tuning mechanism is introduced to improve the performance of the original algorithm. A numerical simulation is performed, and the results confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"
doi:10.1007/s42064-022-0154-0,en,Natural coupled orbit—attitude periodic motions in the perturbed-CRTBP including radiated primary and oblate secondary,"['OriginalPaper', 'Research Article']","This study investigated periodic coupled orbit—attitude motions within the perturbed circular restricted three-body problem (P-CRTBP) concerning the perturbations of a radiated massive primary and an oblate secondary. The radiated massive primary was the Sun, and each planet in the solar system could be considered an oblate secondary. Because the problem has no closed-form solution, numerical methods were employed. Nevertheless, the general response of the problem could be non-periodic or periodic, which is significantly depended on the initial conditions of the orbit-attitude states. Therefore, the simultaneous orbit and attitude initial states correction (SOAISC) algorithm was introduced to achieve precise initial conditions. On the other side, the conventional initial guess vector was essential as the input of the correction algorithm and increased the probability of reaching more precise initial conditions. Thus, a new practical approach was developed in the form of an orbital correction algorithm to obtain the initial conditions for the periodic orbit of the P-CRTBP. This new proposed algorithm may be distinguished from previously presented orbital correction algorithms by its ability to propagate the P-CRTBP family orbits around the Lagrangian points using only one of the periodic orbits of the unperturbed CRTBP (U-CRTBP). In addition, the Poincaré map and Floquet theory search methods were used to recognize the various initial guesses for attitude parameters. Each of these search methods was able to identify different initial guesses for attitude states. Moreover, as a new innovation, these search methods were applied as a powerful tool to select the appropriate inertia ratio for a satellite to deliver periodic responses from the coupled model. Adding the mentioned perturbations to the U-CRTBP could lead to the more accurate modeling of the examination environment and a better understanding of a spacecraft’s natural motion. A comparison between the orbit-attitude natural motions in the unperturbed and perturbed models was also conducted to show this claim.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

In this work, we study a novel and efficient full-duplex strategy network ( FSNet ) to address this issue, by considering a better mutual restraint scheme linking motion and appearance allowing exploitation of cross-modal features from the fusion and decoding stage. Specifically, we introduce a relational cross-attention module (RCAM) to achieve bidirectional message propagation across embedding sub-spaces. To improve the model’s robustness and update inconsistent features from the spatiotemporal embeddings, we adopt a bidirectional purification module after the RCAM. Extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks show that our FSNet is robust to various challenging scenarios (e.g., motion blur and occlusion), and compares well to leading methods both for video object segmentation and video salient object detection.

However, it is quite challenging as human facial images contain large areas of similar textures, rich expressions, and large rotations. These characteristics also result in the scarcity of large, annotated real-world datasets. We propose a robust and accurate method to learn facial optical flow in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, we utilize various shape priors, including face depth, landmarks, and parsing, to guide the self-supervised learning task via a differentiable nonrigid registration framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable improvements for facial optical flow estimation in the presence of significant expressions and large rotations.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

As a popular application, composition recommendation for a photo focusing on a specific subject has been ignored by recent deep-learning-based composition recommendation approaches. In this paper, we propose a subject-aware image composition recommendation method, SAC-Net, which takes an RGB image and a binary subject window mask as input, and returns good compositions as crops containing the subject. Our model first determines candidate scores for all possible coarse cropping windows. The crops with high candidate scores are selected and further refined by regressing their corner points to generate the output recommended cropping windows. The final scores of the refined crops are predicted by a final score regression module. Unlike existing methods that need to preset several cropping windows, our network is able to automatically regress cropping windows with arbitrary aspect ratios and sizes. We propose novel stability losses for maximizing smoothness when changing cropping windows along with view changes. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods not only on the subject-aware image composition recommendation task, but also for general purpose composition recommendation. We also have designed a multistage labeling scheme so that a large amount of ranked pairs can be produced economically. We use this scheme to propose the first subject-aware composition dataset SACD, which contains 2777 images, and more than 5 million composition ranked pairs.

In this paper, we present an efficient end-to-end deep learning model for automatically detecting and removing specular highlights in a single image. In particular, an encoder—decoder network is utilized to detect specular highlights, and then a novel Unet-Transformer network performs highlight removal; we append transformer modules instead of feature maps in the Unet architecture. We also introduce a highlight detection module as a mask to guide the removal task. Thus, these two networks can be jointly trained in an effective manner. Thanks to the hierarchical and global properties of the transformer mechanism, our framework is able to establish relationships between continuous self-attention layers, making it possible to directly model the mapping between the diffuse area and the specular highlight area, and reduce indeterminacy within areas containing strong specular highlight reflection.

Our key observation is that to recover the underlying structures as well as surface details, given partial input, a fundamental component is a good feature representation that can capture both global structure and local geometric details. We accordingly first propose FSNet, a feature structuring module that can adaptively aggregate point-wise features into a 2D structured feature map by learning multiple latent patterns from local regions. We then integrate FSNet into a coarse-to-fine pipeline for point cloud completion. Specifically, a 2D convolutional neural network is adopted to decode feature maps from FSNet into a coarse and complete point cloud. Next, a point cloud upsampling network is used to generate a dense point cloud from the partial input and the coarse intermediate output. To efficiently exploit local structures and enhance point distribution uniformity, we propose IFNet, a point upsampling module with a self-correction mechanism that can progressively refine details of the generated dense point cloud. We have conducted qualitative and quantitative experiments on ShapeNet, MVP, and KITTI datasets, which demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art point cloud completion approaches.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

Capturing human motion accurately from a monocular image sequence remains challenging; modeling quality is strongly influenced by temporal consistency of the captured body motion. Our work presents an elegant solution to integrating temporal constraints during fitting. This increases both temporal consistency and robustness during optimization. In detail, we derive parameters of a sequence of body models, representing shape and motion of a person. We optimize these parameters over the complete image sequence, fitting a single consistent body shape while imposing temporal consistency on the body motion, assuming body joint trajectories to be linear over short time. Our approach enables the derivation of realistic 3D body models from image sequences, including jaw pose, facial expression, and articulated hands. Our experiments show that our approach accurately estimates body shape and motion, even for challenging movements and poses. Further, we apply it to the particular application of sign language analysis, where accurate and temporally consistent motion modelling is essential, and show that the approach is well-suited to this kind of application.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

In contrast to significant recent advances in automating the FRP manufacturing process via 3D printing, quality inspection and defect detection remain largely manual and inefficient. In this paper, we propose a new approach to automatically detect, from microscope images, one of the major defects in 3D printed FRP parts: fiber-deficient areas (or equivalently, resin-rich areas). From cross-sectional microscope images, we detect the locations and sizes of fibers, construct their Voronoi diagram, and employ α -shape theory to determine fiber-deficient areas. Our Voronoi diagram and α -shape construction algorithms are specialized to exploit typical characteristics of 3D printed FRP parts, giving significant efficiency gains.

While voxel-based deep learning frameworks have been proposed for this segmentation task, their performance remains limited. In this study, we offer a two-step surface-based deep learning pipeline that achieves significantly better results. Our proposed model takes a surface model of an entire set of principal brain arteries containing aneurysms as input and returns aneurysm surfaces as output. A user first generates a surface model by manually specifying multiple thresholds for time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography images. The system then samples small surface fragments from the entire set of brain arteries and classifies the surface fragments according to whether aneurysms are present using a point-based deep learning network (PointNet++). Finally, the system applies surface segmentation (SO-Net) to surface fragments containing aneurysms. We conduct a direct comparison of the segmentation performance of our proposed surface-based framework and an existing voxel-based method by counting voxels: our framework achieves a much higher Dice similarity (72%) than the prior approach (46%).","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

Most target search studies, especially in robotics, focus on determining either the shortest path when the target’s position is known, or a strategy to find the target as quickly as possible when the target’s position is unknown. However, the target’s position is often known intermittently in the real world, e.g., in the case of using surveillance cameras. Our goal is to help user find a dynamic target efficiently in the real world when the target’s position is intermittently known. In order to achieve this purpose, we have designed an AR guidance assistance system to provide optimal current directional guidance to users, based on searching a prediction graph. We assume that a certain number of depth cameras are fixed in a real scene to obtain dynamic target’s position. The system automatically analyzes all possible meetings between the user and the target, and generates optimal directional guidance to help the user catch up with the target.

Based on the visual navigation framework and motion characteristics of asteroids, a robust and efficient template feature matching method is proposed to adapt to feature distortion and scale change cases for visual navigation of asteroids. The proposed method is primarily based on a motion-constrained discriminative correlation filter (DCF). The prior information provided by the motion constraints between sequence images is used to provide a predicted search region for template feature matching. Additionally, some specific template feature samples are generated using the motion constraints for correlation filter learning, which is beneficial for training a scale and feature distortion adaptive correlation filter for accurate feature matching. Moreover, average peak-to-correlation energy (APCE) and jointly consistent measurements (JCMs) were used to eliminate false matching. Images captured by the Touch And Go Camera System (TAGCAMS) of the Bennu asteroid were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. In particular, both the robustness and accuracy of region matching and template center matching are evaluated. The qualitative and quantitative results illustrate the advancement of the proposed method in adapting to feature distortions and large-scale changes during spacecraft landing.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

However, the recovery outcomes of different areas with the same vegetation assemblage pattern are completely different after long-term evolution. Therefore, understanding the causes of differential vegetation recovery and the mechanism of plant succession is of great significance to the ecological restoration of mines. Three Pinus tabulaeformis plantations with similar initial site conditions and restoration measures but with different secondary succession processes were selected from the open-pit coal mine dump that has been restored for 30 years. Soil physicochemical properties, enzyme activities, vegetation and microbial features were investigated, while the structural equation models were established to explore the interactions between plants, soil and microbes. The results showed that original vegetation configuration and soil nutrient conditions were altered due to secondary succession. With the advancement of the secondary succession process, the coverage of plants increased from 34.8% to 95.5% ( P < 0.05), soil organic matter increased from 9.30 g kg −1 to 21.13 g kg −1 ( P < 0.05), and total nitrogen increased from 0.38 g kg −1 to 1.01 g kg −1 ( P < 0.05).

In this study, the past experimental studies performed in the gas-liquid metal two-phase flow are reviewed, and the void fraction and interfacial area concentration (IAC) database taken in the N 2 -Pb/Bi (nitrogen and lead/bismuth eutectic alloy) two-phase flow in a vertical circular flow channel are collected. In order to obtain the flow characteristics of the gas-liquid metal two-phase flow, the experimental data of the N 2 -Pb/Bi two-phase flow are compared with experimental data of the air-water two-phase flow. The void fraction gradient along the height (namely the flow direction) and the bubble diameter in the N 2 -Pb/Bi two-phase flow are found to be much larger than those in the air-water two-phase flow. These two unique flow characteristics can be explained, respectively, by the large density and surface tension of the Pb/Bi eutectic alloy in the N 2 -Pb/Bi two-phase flow. This study also reviewed the available IAC correlations and found that so far no IAC correlation has been developed for the gas-liquid metal two-phase flow. So, the available major IAC correlations for air- and steam-water two-phase flows are collected and compared with the collected experimental data of the N 2 -Pb/Bi two-phase flow. The comparison shows that these IAC correlations cannot give reliable predictions for the experimental data of the N 2 -Pb/Bi two-phase flow. So, a new IAC correlation has been developed based on the experimental data of the N 2 -Pb/Bi two-phase flow by taking into account the properties and flow characteristics of the two phases. The newly-developed IAC correlation can satisfactorily predict the experimental data of the N 2 -Pb/Bi two-phase flow with the mean relative error of 0.0609.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

Various geophysical processes have modified these regolith layers since their origin. Therefore, the landforms on regolith-blanketed surfaces hold vital clues for reconstructing the geological processes occurring on small bodies. However, the mechanical strength of small body regolith remains unclear, which is an important parameter for understanding its dynamic evolution. Furthermore, regolith mechanical properties are key factors for the design and operation of space missions that interact with small body surfaces. The granular penetrometer, which is an instrument that facilitates in situ mechanical characterization of surface/subsurface materials, has attracted significant attention. However, we still do not fully understand the penetration dynamics related to granular regolith, partially because of the experimental difficulties in measuring grain-scale responses under microgravity, particularly on the longer timescales of small body dynamics. In this study, we analyzed the slow intrusion of a locomotor into granular matter through large-scale numerical simulations based on a soft sphere discrete element model. We demonstrated that the resistance force of cohesionless regolith increases abruptly with penetration depth after contact and then transitions to a linear regime. The scale factor of the steady-state component is roughly proportional to the internal friction of the granular materials, which allows us to deduce the shear strength of planetary soils by measuring their force-depth relationships. When cohesion is included, due to the brittle behavior of cohesive materials, the resistance profile is characterized by a stationary state at a large penetration depth. The saturation resistance, which represents the failure threshold of granular materials, increases with the cohesion strength of the regolith. This positive correlation provides a reliable tool for measuring the tensile strength of granular regolith in small body touchdown missions.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

However, the spatial distribution and the activity-density of termites on a fine-scale in tropical forests are still unknown. We checked the spatial distribution patterns of the feeding groups and species of termites and their co-occurrence pattern in a 1-ha (100 m × 100 m) plot, and their correlation with the environmental factors. We used a standard protocol to collect termite assemblages and classified them into five feeding groups based on their preferred diet: fungus growers, litter feeders, soil feeders, soil-wood feeders, and wood feeders. We measured the environmental factors: soil pH, litter mass, aboveground plant biomass, and topographic position index (TPI). Soil-wood feeders showed the highest activity-density, followed by wood feeders, fungus growers, soil feeders, and litter feeders. Soil-wood feeders and fungus growers demonstated a strong correlation while litter feeders showed weak correlations with other feeding groups. Termite feeding groups and most of the termite species displayed a positive association with the high TPI and the low soil pH patches. Our results indicated that the examined environmental factors influenced the termite community assemblages and distribution patterns on a fine-scale in tropical rainforests.","['Environment', 'Soil Science & Conservation', 'Ecology']"

Based on the advanced CNN method high-resolution net (HRNet) and multi-temporal HR-RSIs, a framework is proposed for monitoring a green evolution of courtyard buildings characterized by their courtyards being roofed (CBR). The proposed framework consists of an expert module focusing on scenes analysis, a CV module for automatic detection, an evaluation module containing thresholds, and an output module for data analysis. Based on this, the changes in the adoption of different CBR technologies (CBRTs), including light-translucent CBRTs (LT-CBRTs) and non-light-translucent CBRTs (NLT-CBRTs), in 24 villages in southern Hebei were identified from 2007 to 2021. The evolution of CBRTs was featured as an inverse S-curve, and differences were found in their evolution stage, adoption ratio, and development speed for different villages. LT-CBRTs are the dominant type but are being replaced and surpassed by NLT-CBRTs in some villages, characterizing different preferences for the technology type of villages. The proposed research framework provides a reference for the evolution monitoring of vernacular buildings, and the identified evolution laws enable to trace and predict the adoption of different CBRTs in a particular village. This work lays a foundation for future exploration of the occurrence and development mechanism of the CBR phenomenon and provides an important reference for the optimization and promotion of CBRTs.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"

However, the FMP-MR energy dissipation mechanism is not fully understood owing to its disordered grid interpenetrating structure. In this work, computer-aided preparation technology is used to accurately reconstruct the complex spiral network structure of FMP-MR multipoint random contact, and a cell group model with an energy dissipation mechanism is proposed to obtain the dynamic energy distribution of the contact friction in both space and time dimensions. By judging the effective contact point, a global displacement ablation phenomenon of hooked staggered porous materials is induced. The macro- and micro-equivalent frictions are introduced to effectively explain the characteristics of the strong energy dissipation in FMP-MR under fretting excitation. A real and effective damping hysteresis constitutive model is then constructed to dynamically capture the mapping relationship between the complex nonlinear topological structure effect of the materials and spatial random contact dry friction in real time. The results indicate that the contact behavior between turns of the FMP-MR wire follows a clear quasi-Gaussian distribution under an external load, forcing the topological results to change. The energy dissipation of the materials revealed peak energy consumption lagging behind the loading limit for a certain distance, which can be determined by the effective contact point and contact dry friction slip. The consistency between the quasi-static compression tests and constitutive curves of the model was quantitatively verified through residual analysis. The data demonstrated the differential behavior of the FMP-MR meso-structure to follow a phased growth law during loading with different action mechanisms in the guiding, main growth, and relaxation stages of the energy consumption displacement curve. In summary, these findings provide an acceptable theoretical basis for the damping energy consumption mechanism and lifetime prediction of FMP-MR.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

Multi-objective optimization could be an effective tool for tackling the aforementioned challenges. Therefore, this paper proposes a life-cycle optimization framework considering thermal comfort, which is beneficial to promoting residents’ motivation for low-carbon retrofit in arid climate regions. First, in response to the above problems, three objective functions are specified in the framework, which are global warming potential (GWP), life cycle cost (LCC), and thermal discomfort hours (TDH). To improve the optimization efficiency, this research uses Deep Neural Networks (DNN) combined with NSGA-II to construct a high-precision prediction model (meta-model for optimization) based on the energy consumption simulation database formed by the orthogonal multi-dimensional design parameters. The accuracy index of the modified model is R 2 > 0.99, cv(RMSE) ≤ 1%, and NMBE ≤ 0.2%, which gets rid of the dilemma of low prediction accuracy of traditional machine learning models. In the scheme comparison and selection stage, the TOPSIS based on two empowerment methods is applied to meet different design tendencies, where the entropy-based method can avoid the interference of subjective preference and significantly improve the objectivity and scientific nature of decision analysis. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is conducted on the variables, which supports guidance for practitioners to carry out the low-carbon design. Finally, the multi-objective optimization analysis for a farmhouse in Turpan is taken as a case study to evaluate the performance of the framework. The results show that the framework could significantly improve the building performance, with 60.8%, 52.5%, and 14.2% reduction in GWP, LCC, and TDH, respectively.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"
doi:10.1007/s12273-022-0933-9,en,A demand side management approach to increase self-consumption in buildings,"['OriginalPaper', 'Research Article']","There is a growing interest in increasing the presence of renewable energy in the electric network. Photovoltaic production from grid-connected systems is leading this growth in terms of households. Alongside this development, concern about network security has emerged, because excesses of intermittent renewable energy on the grid could exceed voltage limits. Self-consumption, understood as the capacity of the producer to consume his or her own production, can partially solve these problems. Thermostatic controllable loads, such as heating and cooling, represent 50% of the total amount of energy consumed by buildings; the proper allocation of these loads could be a driving force for self-consumption. In this study, a demand side management strategy is proposed based on a building energy model equipped with an inverter heat pump coupled with a photovoltaic plant. The goal is to maximize the use of local energy from the photovoltaic plant (self-consumption), reducing the export and import of energy to and from the grid. This goal is achieved by optimizing the set-points in each room. An array of optimal set-points over six years is presented. The results show the capacity of the methodology to match similar values of self-consumption (70% in winter and 50% in summer) obtained by strategies based on chemical batteries. The findings are shown in an energy matching chart at different levels of detail (yearly and monthly). Color bubbles are added to the matching chart to help visualize the unmatched energy of the system graphically. In comparison with actual model predictive control technologies, this study’s strategy offers great simplicity and a large saving in computational time.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"

Physics-informed machine learning could address this need by adding physical consistency to such models. This paper presents metamodeling of thermal comfort in non-air-conditioned buildings using physics-informed machine learning. The studied metamodel incorporated knowledge of both quasi-steady-state heat transfer and dynamic simulation results. Adaptive thermal comfort in an office located in cold and hot European climates was studied with the number of overheating hours as index. A one-at-a-time method was used to gain knowledge from dynamic simulation with TRNSYS software. This knowledge was used to filter the training data and to choose probability distributions for metamodel forms alternative to polynomial. The response of the dynamic model was positively skewed; and thus, the symmetric logistic and hyperbolic secant distributions were inappropriate and outperformed by positively skewed distributions. Incorporating physical knowledge into the metamodel was much more effective than doubling the size of the training sample. The highly flexible Kumaraswamy distribution provided the best performance with R 2 equal to 0.9994 for the cold climate and 0.9975 for the hot climate. Physics-informed machine learning could combine the strength of both physics and machine learning models, and could therefore support building design with flexible, accurate and interpretable metamodels.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"

It is impractical to improve the simulation and prediction abilities by reducing the uncertainties of all parameters. Therefore, identifying the sensitive parameters or parameter combinations is crucial. This study proposes a novel approach: conditional nonlinear optimal perturbations sensitivity analysis (CNOPSA) method. The CNOPSA method fully considers the nonlinear synergistic effects of parameters in the whole parameter space and quantitatively estimates the maximum effects of parameter uncertainties, prone to extreme events. Results of the analytical g-function test indicate that the CNOPSA method can effectively identify the sensitivity of variables. Numerical results of the theoretical five-variable grassland ecosystem model show that the maximum influence of the simulated wilted biomass caused by parameter uncertainty can be estimated and computed by employing the CNOPSA method. The identified sensitive parameters can easily change the simulation or prediction of the wilted biomass, which affects the transformation of the grassland state in the grassland ecosystem. The variance-based approach may underestimate the parameter sensitivity because it only considers the influence of limited parameter samples from a statistical view. This study verifies that the CNOPSA method is effective and feasible for exploring the important and sensitive physical parameters or parameter combinations in numerical models. 数值模式中物理参数的不确定性是数值模拟和预测不确定性的重要来源之一。由于数值模式中包含大量的物理过程和参数，通过减少所有物理参数的不确定性以提高数值模式的模拟能力和预测技巧将花费大量的人力和物力。因此，识别敏感的参数或参数组合至关重要。本研究提出了一种识别物理参数敏感性的新方法：条件非线性最优扰动敏感性分析（CNOPSA）方法。该方法克服了传统方法的局限性，在参数不确定性范围内充分考虑了物理参数间的非线性协同效应，可识别出相对敏感和重要的物理参数和参数组合，并定量估计出由物理参数变化导致的数值模拟和预测不确定性的最大程度，因而适用于对极端事件的研究。 利用理论的g-函数和五变量草原生态系统模型检验了CNOPSA方法的可行性和有效性，结果表明CNOPSA方法可以有效地识别物理变量和物理参数的敏感性。本文进一步利用该方法，定量地估计了由物理参数不确定性导致的该草原生态系统模型中枯草量模拟和预测不确定性的最大程度，识别出的敏感参数的变化易使得草原生态系统发生突变。然而，基于方差分析的参数敏感性分析方法，仅从统计的角度考虑有限的参数样本，易低估物理参数的敏感性。","['Earth Sciences', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Meteorology', 'Geophysics/Geodesy']"

However, the efficiency of these models relies on their capability to estimate more realistic building performance indicators at different temporal and spatial scales. The uncertainty of modelling occupants’ behaviours (OB) aspects is one of the main reasons for the discrepancy between the UBEM predicted results and the building’s actual performance. As a result, research efforts focused on improving the approaches to model OB at an urban scale considering different diversity factors. On the other hand, the impact of occupants in the current practice is still considered through fixed schedules and behaviours pattern. To bridge the gap between academic efforts and practice, the applicability of OB models to be integrated into the available UBEM tools needs to be analyzed. To this end, this paper aims to investigate the flexibility and extensibility of existing UBEM tools to model OB with different approaches by (1) reviewing UBEM’s current workflow and the main characteristics of its inputs, (2) reviewing the existing OB models and identifying their main characteristics and level of details that can contribute to UBEM accuracy, (3) providing a breakdown of the occupant-related features in the commonly used tools.

Based on experimental results obtained on a simple test structure and corresponding numerical validation using both complex eigenvalue analysis (CEA) and transient dynamic analysis (TDA), this study attempts to propose a new fundamental mechanism for FIVN, which is the repeated cycles of partial detachment and then reattachment of the contact surfaces.

It allows occupants to connect and experience outdoor freshness within a semi-enclosed environment. However, skygardens located on a highrise building may generate intense wind gusts, endangering the safety of occupants. Using a validated computational fluid dynamics model, this study investigates the potential of various vegetative barriers or shelterbelts in attenuating the high wind speeds encountered in such spaces and the impact on wind and thermal comfort. Three skygarden configurations were investigated with and without vegetative barriers, simplified and modelled as porous zones, and their effect was studied on the velocity and temperature profile at the occupants’ level. The results indicate that while hedges and trees can offer resistance to airflow, trees provide higher temperature reduction. However, a combination of vegetative and geometrical barriers provides the most optimal condition in the skygarden. The study has identified the importance of assessing wind attenuation characteristics of tree plantations on highrise skygarden, and the results can be used in designing intervention strategies. Moreover, vegetation can attenuate pollutants and mitigate poor air quality by surface deposition, and future studies should investigate in that direction.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"

Micro-dimples were generated by a dual-frequency surface texturing method, in which a high-frequency (16.3 kHz) three-dimensional (3D) vibration and a low-frequency (230 Hz) one-dimensional (1D) vibration were applied at the tool tip simultaneously, resulting in the generation of the hierarchical micro-dimples in a single step. Rotating cylinder-on-pin tribological tests were conducted to compare the tribological performance of the non-textured reference specimen and micro-dimple samples. The effect of surface textures generated with various shape parameters (long drop and short drop), dimension parameters (length and surface texture density), and operation parameters (load and sliding velocity) on the tribological performance was evaluated. Stribeck curves indicate that the hierarchical micro-dimples exhibit a lower coefficient of friction than the reference specimen in the high contact-pressure regions. It is also observed that variation in the length of a micro-dimple, the shape effect, is the major factor affecting the friction response of the textured surfaces. The generation of additional hydrodynamic pressure and lift effect by hierarchical structures is the main reason for the improved performance of hierarchical micro-dimple surfaces.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

While previous solutions have shown some success, they do not fully utilize the depth information from the 2D inputs. With the goal of addressing this depth ambiguity, we build a system that takes 2D joint locations as input along with their estimated depth value and predicts their 3D positions in camera coordinates. Our system out performs comparable frame-by-frame 3D human pose estimation networks on the largest publicly available 3d motion data set, Human 3.6M. To provide further evidence for the usefulness of predicted depth values in the 3D pose estimation problem, we perform an extensive statistical analysis showing that even with potentially noisy depth predictions there is still a statistically significant correlation between the predicted depth value and the true depth value.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Simulated rooms and two-dimensional panning systems are simply implemented on computer screens to facilitate the placement of sound sources within space. In this chapter, we present design aspects for mixing in VR, investigating already existing virtual music mixing products and creating a framework from which a virtual spatial-music mixing tool can be implemented.

Reuse is often mentioned as a sustainable solution to linear consumption’s negative impacts. Shared ownership has potential advantages in life span extension computers over individual ownership. Moreover, it allows understanding how computers are used during their reuse phase to estimate lifecycle impacts and evaluate circular business models. This paper aims to identify specific success factors and barriers for shared property in four empirical cases of reused and servitised computers launched by eReuse, a collaborative computer reuse platform in Barcelona. The scope of the study is the impact of reused computers under different ownership-sharing scenarios and roles involved. Ethnographic action research and quantitative data help us analyse to what extent shared ownership models manage to lengthen the life span of computers and what roles and life extension strategies are beneficial to its optimal functionality. We found that roles as maintainers or activities such as product and software upgrading are essential to ensuring the dynamism and flexibility required to keep computers functional for an extended lifespan under a shared ownership model.","['Business and Management', 'IT in Business', 'Environmental Management', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

There is an information overload and the academic field has also become technology driven. Rather than technology operating according to the teacher’s needs, individuals are required to adapt to the existing software. Due to the incompatibilities between software, hardware and the formats of computer files, information chaos is growing to huge proportions. Unless educational algorithms (i.e., what is done with educational content) are defined, computer algorithms, software, and systems for the integration of IT into teaching cannot be designed. As part of our research into the automation of knowledge-based processes, which includes educational processes, we have managed to solve the problem of how to simulate human knowledge and pass it on to a computer, so that it can ‘understand’ it. Our solution is a model of virtual knowledge that can be processed quickly by a computer. The computer ‘understands’ this as a universal representation of knowledge, while from a teacher's point of view, it is an ordinary table into which the teacher inserts educational content. This virtual knowledge (having the structure of a database table) acts a kind of knowledge container that isomorphically connects the mental processes of the teacher with the physical processes of the computer. Our WPad educational software is programmed to control the structure (content), so, it is possible to create educational knowledge tables and personal knowledge base for any activity that the teacher performs during teaching, or research. The teacher does not need to adapt to the technology; instead, the technology adapts to the teacher's activities. Since the software runs on every Windows computer and works as a multiple-in-one educational IT tool for a variety of lessons, it is probably the most efficient and cheapest technology solution. It is used to support the integration of technology into classroom and distance learning. Future research will focus on the creation of multilingual educational packages.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It is urgent to adopt digital means and build digital satellites to provide users with comprehensive and real tools for task planning verification, daily operation and maintenance and effectiveness evaluation. The mission level system effectiveness simulation system for equipment planning and index demonstration has the problems of non fidelity of on-board software, large simulation granularity and insufficient process detail simulation, which is difficult to be applied to daily business scenarios such as mission deduction and replay, on orbit operation and maintenance management and so on. To solve this problem, the on-board software in the loop simulation is realized by introducing virtual computer technology, and digital satellite is realized by co-simulation of virtual computer and multi-system models based on various flows such as satellite information flow, control flow, energy flow and data flow, which runs on co-simulation platform based on DDS(data distributed service). Digital satellite can effectively simulate the real operation and response, replay and deduction task process, assist in on orbit operation and maintenance, and improve the service efficiency of equipment.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Computer Applications', 'Geography, general', 'Earth System Sciences']"

GRACE is an interactive installation combining IoT, origami paper, and the history of computing performed at three events in Denmark, the USA, and France. Each event was designed to unpack equity in computing through different types of sociomaterial performances, while allowing us to collect data about the lived experiences of equity in computing. GRACE is both reconfigurable and relational. It is reconfigurable because GRACE is malleable and can take different forms (reaching out to people who are committed to the agenda as well as to people who are within the domain but not necessarily committed to the agenda) – even though its core remains the same. GRACE is relational because the nature of the installation emerges in use and thus is shaped by the relational connections created through specific use and people enacting the artefact. Through sociomaterial manifestations, GRACE seamlessly integrates the performance of equity in computing with data collection on equity in computing. We argue that designing GRACE as a sociomaterial assemblage allowed for long-term engagement with a gender-equity agenda across multiple diverse encounters and over several years.","['Computer Science', 'The Computing Profession', 'Computers and Society', 'Gender Studies']"

But when the final aim is to perform live on stage, the employment of these technologies is anything but straightforward, for sharing the virtual musical experience with the audience gets quite arduous. In this chapter, we assess in detail the several technical and conceptual challenges linked to the composition of IVMI performances on stage, i.e., their scenography , providing a new critical perspective on IVMI performance and design. We first propose a set of dimensions meant to analyse IVMI scenographies, as well as to evaluate their compatibility with different instrument metaphors and performance rationales. Such dimensions are built from the specifics and constraints of DMIs and VEs; they include the level of immersion of musicians and spectators and provide an insight into the interaction techniques afforded by 3D user interfaces in the context of musical expression.

Low-level hardware measurements can be used to distinguish job transitions between categories and within phases of categories. This relationship with the categories allows a technical basis for SLAs, capital purchase decisions, and future computer architecture design decisions.

Historically, most of the research works concentrated on image level recognition task as basic ones. However there is still huge room for improvements when moving towards video level tasks. Generally, video models are built on top of image level architectures with attention mechanism or 3D-CNN layers that are globally interconnected across spatial and temporal dimensions. While recent studies of Transformers advocated more on architectural changes, CNN based approaches focus more on best practice of training neural networks which led to a better speed-accuracy trade-off. These best practices are yet to be developed for video recognition tasks. The major contribution of this paper is a novel approach for video-model training. This approach is based on unsupervised hard samples mining to focus training on them rather than on whole dataset.

For the first time, a mechanical system with five degrees of freedom is proposed as a deterministic mathematical model of the torque scheme of a power unit. The Laplace Transform is used to solve a system of differential equations of mass motions of a mathematical model under zero initial conditions. On the basis of the method of determinants and methods of the theory of signal graphs, information relationships are established in the form of transfer functions between the torques of cylinders and the signal of fluctuations in the speed of rotation of the first mass of the crankshaft. When analyzing the special points of transfer functions, it is found a satisfactory coincidence of the calculation results of both methods. By comparison, it is found that the method based on the theory of signal graphs provides better calculation performance. It is also established that the determinant method gives a simplified expression of the zero-pole transfer function, which in further studies can be taken into account or not, depending on the type of measurement information signal. Z-transformations of transmission functions are obtained and a scheme for computer modeling of the contribution signal of the first cylinder to the signal of fluctuations in the speed of rotation of the first mass of the crankshaft of the power unit is constructed based on them. In the Mathcad software, a scheme for computer modeling of torque conversion processes with obtaining a measurement information signal is constructed. When compiling it, the possibility of identifying the parameters of a deterministic mathematical model of a power unit based on experimental data of instantaneous speed and adjusting the length of information connections between the contributions of individual cylinders to the fluctuation signal is taken into account.

When working with sound and space interactions, making VR systems becomes a fundamentally interdisciplinary endeavour. To support the design of future systems, designers need an understanding of spatial design decisions that impact audio practitioners’ processes and communication. This chapter proposes a typology of VR interactive audio systems, focusing on their function and the role of space in their design. Spatial categories are proposed to be able to analyse the role of space within existing interactive audio VR products. Based on the spatial design considerations explored in this chapter, a series of implications for design are offered that future research can exploit.","['Computer Science', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Computer Appl. in Arts and Humanities', 'Music', 'Media Design', 'Multimedia Information Systems']"

The tracking accuracy of the data transmission antenna to the ground receiving station directly affects the smooth execution of the satellite mission. The imaging mission characteristics of remote sensing satellites are analyzed, and the closed-loop tracking mode of the data antenna based on angle and angular acceleration is designed. The data antenna controller receives the data of the antenna pointing angle from the control computer, and calculates the angular velocity of the antenna to track the ground station according to the predetermined control algorithm, uses the angular velocity to control the antenna to track the ground station continuously, and feeds back the position angle and angular velocity of the antenna to the control computer periodically. The results of ground simulation shows that the tracking accuracy of the data transmission antenna using the closed-loop tracking mode meets the requirements of remote sensing satellites, laying a foundation for the design of inter-satellite data transmission links in future.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics']"

However, most of such approaches assume substantial amount of computational resources available to the algorithm to make it fairly efficient. Therefore, a vast majority of them are hardly feasible on low-powered and less-capable embedded IoT devices, where the object detection tasks are equally common and usually even more challenging—considering a huge diversity in environmental conditions, camera positions and resolutions, outdoor illuminations and deployments in both urban and offline remote environments.

Given a probe vehicle image, all of the same vehicles need to be found in the gallery data. However, because of the different camera shooting angles and vehicle driving directions, extreme changes in the viewing angle in vehicle images leads to a dissimilarity in shape, resulting in a difference in vision and having a significant impact on the accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a method for eliminating bias between different viewpoints, specifically, orientation regression training is conducted on a free synthetic dataset through the VehicleX engine, orientation-aware features are extracted using the trained network above, and the similarity calculated by the original re-ID feature and the orientation-aware feature are then fused to obtain the final similarity, which can effectively remove the orientation bias that exists with conventional re-ID features.

In 2021, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control issued alarming new data indicating that the rate of autism among American eight-year-old children had risen again, this time to 1 in 44, or about 2.3% (American Psychiatric Association in Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders. Arlington [ 1 ]). Many studies prove the effectiveness and positive impact of using smart telephones, mobile apps, and computer games to practice skills as therapy for children with ASD (Meghan et al. in Pediatrics 141:335–345 [ 2 ]). This review summarizes some of the most interesting and accessible serious games described in the scientific literature and designed to improve the social and communication skills of infants and toddlers with ASD. Learning and playing games are fundamental to the development of children's social skills allowing them to form independent relationships with peers (Simonoff et al. in J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry 47(8):921–929 [ 3 ]). As autistic children often have difficulty with peer relationships (Gordon-Lipkin et al. in Pediatrics 141(4) [ 4 ]), developing game-based skills through computer-assisted solutions could be an essential tool for autistic children to improve their social performance.

Manufacturing in the Internet-of-Thing (IoT) era will be more efficient, better quality, easier to manage, and more transparent through integration of physical and cyber technologies in Industry 4.0-based smart factories. Factory automation relies heavily on sensors and AI to make the system intelligent. Sensor technology advancements and developments linked to Industry 4.0 serve as the backbone for the inclusive expansion of industry and the economic success of any country. It is imperative that manufacturing organizations and supply chains have access to the latest low-cost sensor technology for collecting data and putting it to good use. Standard sensor types include position sensors, flow, temperature, flow rate, pressure, and force. A wide range of fields, including motorsport, health care, manufacturing, the armed forces, and agriculture all make use of them on a day-to-day basis. Increasing efficiency through automation is the goal of Industry 4.0. The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief overview and viewpoint on the most recent advancements in AI and the associated problems. Attempts to define the main ideas and tools behind this new era of manufacturing in the early years of the so-called fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) always ended up referring to the concept of smart machines that could communicate with each other and with the environment. When it comes to the new industry 4.0, it’s the defined cyber physical systems connected by the IoT that get all the attention. Nonetheless, several tools and applications will benefit the new industrial environment, complementing the actual formation of a smart, embedded system capable of performing autonomous tasks.

As a result, artificial intelligence science is well suited to the challenges that arise during the fourth industrial revolution’s consolidation.

The paired Totally Looks Like (TLL) image dataset is a good example of visually similar paired images to figure out how humans compare images. In this research, we consider these more generic annotated categories to build a semantic manifold distance. We introduce an atypical triplet-loss using the inverse Kullback-Leibler divergence to model the distribution of the anchor-positive (a-p) distances. In the new redefinition of triplet-loss, the anchor-negative (a-n) loss is conditional to the a-p distance distribution which prevents the loss correction fluctuations in the plain summed triplet-loss function of absolute distances. The proposed atypical triplet-loss builds a manifold from relative distances to a “super” anchor represented by the a-p distribution. The evaluation on the paired images of the TLL dataset showed that the retrieving score from the first candidate guess (top-1) is $$75\%$$ 75 % which is $$\times 2.5$$ × 2.5 higher compared to the recall score of the baseline triplet-loss which is limited to $$29\%$$ 29 % , and with a top-5 pairing score as high as $$78\%$$ 78 % which represents a gain of $$\times 1.4$$ × 1.4 .","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computers and Education', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.

To reduce development times and increase product quality, the systematic application of tolerance-cost optimization from the early design phases requires a deep knowledge of the tolerance effects on both product performance and production cost. However, many factors still hamper its industrial diffusion, comprising three improvement areas: data and parameters sharing, flexibility to application complexity, and integration of simulation tools. Data and parameters sharing are a key factor since directly affect the representation and information transfer of tolerances and manufacturing processes. Both tolerances-cost relations and optimization structure must be properly represented, through a knowledge modelling framework. The present paper introduces an interoperability framework for the Computer-Aided tolerance-cost optimization. Through creating instances for tolerance and manufacturing process information, the interoperability is implemented defining a systematic sequence of steps to breakdown the multi-disciplinary optimization structure. Starting from the assembly structure, with the extraction of information from the 3D models to its transfer for parametric modelling into tolerance simulation and cost estimation environments, the interoperability framework identifies input-output relations and highlights the integration provided by multi-disciplinary optimization structure. The application of the presented framework on an archetypal case study provides an analysis of the suitability of the method, highlighting the further improvements. In this way it is possible to improve the interoperability between design and simulation virtual environments, to optimize tolerances in a concurrent a multi-disciplinary manner.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Computer-Aided Engineering (CAD, CAE) and Design']"

Nevertheless, the training of state-of-the-art neural network models is usually based on the availability of large sets of supervised data. Indeed, deep neural networks have a huge number of parameters which, to be properly trained, require a fairly large dataset of supervised examples. This problem is particularly relevant in the medical field due to privacy issues and the high cost of image tagging by medical experts. In this chapter, we present a new approach that allows to reduce this limitation by generating synthetic images with their corresponding supervision. In particular, this approach can be applied in semantic segmentation, where the generated images (and label-maps) can be used to augment real datasets during network training. The main characteristic of our method, differently from other existing techniques, lies in the generation procedure carried out in multiple steps, based on the intuition that, by splitting the procedure in multiple phases, the overall generation task is simplified. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-stage approach has been evaluated on two different domains, retinal fundus and chest X-ray images. In both domains, the multi-stage approach has been compared with the single-stage generation procedure. The results suggest that generating images in multiple steps is more effective and computationally cheaper, yet allowing high resolution, realistic images to be used for training deep networks.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Health Informatics']"

Recent literature has also investigated the use of socially acceptable, mobile and miniature devices for BCIs. This study explores the possibility of using a mobile EEG/EOG device in a form-factor of the glasses for decoding visual imagery that could be used as a control strategy for BCIs. The decoding performance of a mobile EEG/EOG device was compared to a 16 channel research-grade EEG headset. 14 participants were asked to mentally visualize the image they were presented belonging to one of two different groups: coffee brands and artworks. Two devices simultaneously recorded EEG data from both mobile and consumer grade EEG headset as well as EOG data from the glasses during the experiment. Common spatial pattern and sample entropy were used as a feature set and a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier was used for the classification of tasks. The low channel EEG/EOG device achieved an average accuracy of 73% and 75% for coffee and art stimuli groups, respectively. The research grade EEG system achieved an average accuracy of 52% and 79% for the same families of stimuli. The results indicate that low channel EEG/EOG devices could be further explored for decoding visual imagery.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The hybrid BCIs jointly induce different electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and could improve system performance effectively. This study designed an online BCI with 120 commands and high-speed by hybrid P300 and steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) features. A time-frequency-phase encoding strategy was used to encode 120 commands in a short time, this strategy used time-locked P300s and frequency and phase-locked SSVEPs with a wide frequency band. The step-wise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA) and ensemble task-related component analysis (eTRCA) were severally used to decode P300s and SSVEPs. As a result, online average spelling ac-curacy across six subjects was 83.89%. Average and highest information transfer rate (ITR) for this system was 151.53 bits/min and 175.09 bits/min, respectively. Meanwhile, the shortest time for out-putting one command was only 1.45 s. These results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this high-speed BCI with 120 commands, furthermore, this study used a wider frequency band of SSVEPs to encode 120 commands, which is helpful to extend larger command sets and achieve higher system performance.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Applications', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Mathematics of Computing']"

It highlights that an AI system does not represent a robot or physical machine. The software can be operated on different kinds of hardware systems or platforms but does not require to have any physical shape. Section 2.2 gives an overview of different AI technology aspects. It shows the differences in data computation and progress between humans and computer systems. Section 2.3 describes several AI technologies and highlights the challenge of generated bias. If the AI algorithm gets trained with an already biased data set whether that can happen with consciousness or not, it will not generate a “better human.” The next Sect. 2.4 lists some AI challenges. A current main challenge is that humans still see AI systems as robots or machines and think of physical threats or opportunities. As AI systems can be only software modules, it is recommended to shift the broad society discussions from an attacking Terminator robot to broader ethics and responsibility discussion. Every citizen should take responsibility and proactive actions to shape “Friendly AI” systems. Like every technology, also AI can get abused and used in a not general friendly way. Section 2.5 describes opportunities and risks of AI technology. As humans stopped being goal driven, Section 2.6 highlights the scenario, where future AI systems might overtake the definition of goals for humans. To generate a broad awareness within society to develop and implement AI systems in daily life, it needs acceptance, transparency, and understanding.

Whilst SVEs have been extensively researched for many application domains including education, entertainment, work and training, there is limited research on the creative aspects. This results in many unanswered design questions such as how to design the user experience without being detrimental to the creative output, and how to design spatial configurations to support both individual creativity and collaboration. Here, we explore multi-modal approaches to supporting creativity in collaborative music making in SVEs. We outline an SVE, LeMo, which allows two people to create music collaboratively. We then present two studies; the first explores how free-form visual 3D annotations instead of spoken communication can support collaborative composition processes and human–human interaction. Five classes of use of annotation were identified in the study, three of which are particularly relevant to the future design of sonic interactions in virtual environments. The second study used a modified version of LeMo to test the support for a creative collaboration of two different spatial audio settings, which according to the results, changed participants’ behaviour and affected their collaboration.

The efficiency of COVID-19 diagnosis has become highly significant. As deep learning and convolutional neural network (CNN) has been widely utilized and been verified in analyzing medical images, it has become a powerful tool for computer-assisted diagnosis. However, there are two most significant challenges in medical image classification with the help of deep learning and neural networks, one of them is the difficulty of acquiring enough samples, which may lead to model overfitting. Privacy concerns mainly bring the other challenge since medical-related records are often deemed patients’ private information and protected by laws such as GDPR and HIPPA. Federated learning can ensure the model training is decentralized on different devices and no data is shared among them, which guarantees privacy. However, with data located on different devices, the accessible data of each device could be limited. Since transfer learning has been verified in dealing with limited data with good performance, therefore, in this paper, We made a trial to implement federated learning and transfer learning techniques using CNNs to classify COVID-19 using lung CT scans. We also explored the impact of dataset distribution at the client-side in federated learning and the number of training epochs a model is trained.

Mixed reality head-mounted displays (MRHMDs) have the potential of improving the practical applications for BCIs. However, it’s unclear whether the visual stimulus color designed for traditional BCIs still works in mixed reality. Therefore, this study developed a 10-command SSVEP-BCI system in mixed reality using Hololens2, and explored the system’s performance with two stimulus colors (white and red) against four monochrome backgrounds (green, blue, white, and black). Eight subjects participated in the experiment. Cross-correlation task-related component analysis (xTRCA) was used to recognize the target command. Results showed that both stimulus and background colors affect BCI performance. Specifically, the white stimulus color significantly outperformed the red one on the blue and black backgrounds, while the red stimulus outperformed the white one on the green and white backgrounds. The color contrast ratio (CCR) between the background and stimulus colors correlated positively with SSVEP recognition accuracy. In mixed reality, SSVEP-based BCIs must optimize visual stimulus color, and the CCR is an important criterion for optimization.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Applications', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Mathematics of Computing']"

Text summarization is the process of generating a condensed text form from single or multiple text documents. Extractive summaries are generated by stringing together selected sentences taken from the input text document without any modification, whereas abstractive summaries convey the salient ideas in the input, may reuse phrases or clauses from the input text, and may add new phrases/sentences which are not part of the input text. Extractive summarization guarantees that the generated sentences will be grammatically correct, whereas abstractive methods can generate summaries that are coherent, at the expense of grammatical errors. To this end, we propose to integrate an extractive method based on lexical chains and an abstractive method that uses concept generalization and fusion. The former method tries to identify the most important concepts in the input document with the help of lexical chains and then extract the sentences that contain those concepts. The latter method identifies generalizable concepts in the input and fuses them to generate a shorter version of the input. We evaluated our method using ROUGE and the results show that the integrated approach was successful in generating summaries that are more close to human generated versions.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Mobile and Network Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data']"

The videos captured by a camera are prone to various distortions such as noise, smoke, haze, low or uneven illumination, blur, rain, and compression, which affect visual quality. Automatic identification of distortions is important when enhancing video quality. Video quality assessment involves two stages: (1) classification of distortions affecting the video frames and (2) ranking of these distortions. A novel video dataset was utilized for training, validating, and testing. Working with this dataset was challenging because it included nine categories of distortions and four levels of severity. The greatest challenge was the availability of multiple types of distortions in the same video. The work presented in this paper addresses the problem of multi-label distortion classification and ranking. A vision transformer was used for feature learning. The experiment showed that the proposed solution performed well in terms of F1 score of single distortion (77.9%) and F1 score of single and multiple distortions (69.9%).

People may use the growing brain–computer interface (BCI) technology to control, communicate, and monitor their objects by utilizing or interacting with assistive devices. BCI technology will surely rely on improved signal capture and clear validation of actual research and delivery models in the future, which will be connected to the dependability issue. For the BCI system to work better, an appropriate signal processing approach must be used that makes it easier to collect physiological data and a higher classifier suitable for the specificity of the system. We offer a concise overview of several signal processing strategies for improving BCI focus. A supervised classification method is utilized to improve the support vector machine in order to recognize and categorize EEG data. The EEG data’s temporal domain properties are retrieved and input as feature vectors into the SVM, which are subsequently utilized for classification and identification. The algorithm’s exploration capabilities and convergence time have both improved, as shown by statistical analysis of the data. The SVM parameters are then optimized using this information. The approaches for feature extraction and classification are covered in this study. This outcome represents a 2–5% improvement over the previous technique. EEG (Electroencephalography) is a complex bio-electrical signal. Researchers may uncover useful physiological information if they do a thorough examination of this data. The challenges that BCI data processing designers face are discussed here, along with some drawings of possible existing and prospective solutions. We create ways to extract and identify specific traits from the standpoint of BCI systems, and we conclude with a thorough conclusion and interpretation.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Many reasons can be pointed out for this, some of which related to the abstract nature of these subjects and the lack of previous related knowledge by the students. In this paper we tackle this challenge using gamification in the teaching/learning process, with two main goals in mind. The first is to increase the intrinsic motivation of students to learn, by making the whole process more fun, enjoyable and competitive. The second is to facilitate the learning process by providing intuitive tools for the visualization of data structures and algorithmic output, together with a tool for automated assessment that decreases the dependence on the teacher and allows them to work more autonomously. We validated this approach over the course of three academic years in a Computer Science degree of the Polytechnic of Porto, Portugal, through the use of a questionnaire. Results show that the effects of using games and game elements have a generally positive effect on motivation and on the overall learning process.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Still, modern generative models usually analyze image at the scene level. Hence, it is challenging to control the style and quality of individual object instances. We propose an instance-quantized conditional generative model for the synthesis of images with high-fidelity instances of multiple classes. Specifically, we train two generators simultaneously: a scene generator that synthesizes the background environment and an instance generator that synthesizes each object instance individually. We design a differentiable image compositing layer that assembles the resulting image and allows effective error back-propagation. For our generators $$G_S$$ G S and $$G_I$$ G I we developed a new architecture leveraging modulated convolutional blocks. We evaluate our model and baselines on ADE20k , MHPv2 , and Cityscapes datasets to demonstrate that our instance-quantized framework outperforms baselines in terms of FID and mIoU scores. Moreover, our approach allows us to separately control the style of each object and learn fine texture details.

It studies various properties of the image such as image brightness, color, pixels, contrast, and resolution and gathers data from the image. It is necessary to monitor the condition of tool as it affects the quality of the machined part and also the tooling cost. Tool wear detection is the process of analyzing the amount of wear on the tool. The work depicts a program for the detection of tool wear. The program calculates the number of pixels within the worn-out part of the tool. The extraction of the worn-out parts from the un-worn part is done by using computer vision operations such as canny edge operation, dilation operation, and erosion operation. The program provides an output in the form of an image that shows a worn-out region covered by a blue boundary. The program also outputs a value that gives a comparative idea about the tool wear.

As the geriatric population progresses, the need for novel solutions to manage age-related diseases increases. To combat this, intensive rehabilitation treatment is instituted repetitively. However, the traditional rehabilitation treatment regimes, involving tedious and monotonous activity with numerous repetitions, lacking active patient participation are of boring and strenuous nature. This ultimately leads to suboptimal treatment outcomes necessitating long-term care. To overcome this, a range of interactive and easy measuring technology-based innovative solutions fused with the rehabilitation process is being investigated to ameliorate the effectiveness and productivity of rehabilitation programs and escalate the independence of patients and empower them to administer their treatment. Recently, game-based Virtual Reality (VR) rehabilitation protocol has turned out to be a promising therapeutic alternative, amalgamating Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) with VR to activate neuro-motor functions, sustain motivation and reach rehabilitation goals to improve the quality of life of patients. Virtual rehabilitation is a computer-generated interactive patient-centred simulation system combining computers, special interfaces, and simulation exercises that imitates reality and provides an artificial environment mimicking real-world experience. The architecture of the system is designed in such a way that it can remotely track the patients, obtain data, and tailor the rehabilitation sessions according to the current needs of the patients. VR improves both motor skills and confidence for daily living and in numerous situations to enhance functional results, improving the clinical and social benefits of surgery. Thus, game-based VR is being developed to allow clinicians to create game-based VR tasks and this will serve to drive advances in rehabilitation interventions.","['Computer Science', 'Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Semantic learning of classifiers involves the knowledge of edge-labels, which is a complex problem in image processing. Here we examine several levels of information in order to adopt a feasible method where all edges required pixels for the continuous detection of the objects. In this paper, we study the application of object detection and several recent approaches developed using boundary information in past decades.
