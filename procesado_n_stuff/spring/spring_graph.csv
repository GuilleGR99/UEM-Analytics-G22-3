The numerical elucidations of the governing equations achieved for various values of flow fields are taken out for the several parameters inflowing into the problem and solved by raising the Galerkin finite element technique. By taking the range of the magnetic field parameter 0 ≤ M ≤ 5, the range of viscosity ratio parameter is 0 ≤ β ≤ 5, and micro-gyration parameter is 0 ≤ n ≤ 5, whereas the value of Grashof number lies in 0 ≤ Gr ≤ 2 and −2 ≤ Gr ≤ 0. The numerical results and impact on the translation velocity and temperature are presented and discussed through graphs and listed in the tables. With an increase of β and Gr , the velocity increases, and the reverse effect is found with enhancing of M and n . With enhanced values of M, n, Pr , and R , the result in C f rises.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

For some potential missions, the orbits of interest are selected as nearly stable to reduce the possibility of rapid departure. However, the linearly stable nature of these orbits is also a drawback for their timely insertion into or departure from the orbit. Stable or nearly stable near rectilinear halo orbits (NRHOs), distant retrograde orbits (DROs), and lunar orbits offer potential long-horizon trajectories for exploration missions and demand efficient operations. The current investigation focuses on leveraging stretching directions as a tool for departure and trajectory design applications. The magnitude of the state variations along the maximum stretching direction is expected to grow rapidly and, therefore, offers information for efficient departure from the orbit. Similarly, maximum stretching in reverse time enables arrival with a minimal maneuver magnitude.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"
doi:10.1007/s42757-022-0133-y,en,Assessment of simplified momentum equations for free surface flows through rigid porous media,"['OriginalPaper', 'Research Article']","In many applications, free surface flow through rigid porous media has to be modeled. Examples refer to coastal engineering applications as well as geotechnical or biomedical applications. Albeit the frequent applications, slight inconsistencies in the formulation of the governing equations can be found in the literature. The main goal of this paper is to identify these differences and provide a quantitative assessment of different approaches. Following a review of the different formulations, simulation results obtained from three alternative formulations are compared with experimental and numerical data. Results obtained by 2D and 3D test cases indicate that the predictive differences returned by the different formulations remain small for most applications, in particular for small porous Reynolds number Re P < 5000. Thus it seems justified to select a simplified formulation that supports an efficient algorithm and coding structure in a computational fluid dynamics environment. An estimated accuracy depending on the porous Reynolds number or the mean grain diameter is given for the simplified formulation.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

The radiated massive primary was the Sun, and each planet in the solar system could be considered an oblate secondary. Because the problem has no closed-form solution, numerical methods were employed. Nevertheless, the general response of the problem could be non-periodic or periodic, which is significantly depended on the initial conditions of the orbit-attitude states. Therefore, the simultaneous orbit and attitude initial states correction (SOAISC) algorithm was introduced to achieve precise initial conditions. On the other side, the conventional initial guess vector was essential as the input of the correction algorithm and increased the probability of reaching more precise initial conditions. Thus, a new practical approach was developed in the form of an orbital correction algorithm to obtain the initial conditions for the periodic orbit of the P-CRTBP. This new proposed algorithm may be distinguished from previously presented orbital correction algorithms by its ability to propagate the P-CRTBP family orbits around the Lagrangian points using only one of the periodic orbits of the unperturbed CRTBP (U-CRTBP). In addition, the Poincaré map and Floquet theory search methods were used to recognize the various initial guesses for attitude parameters. Each of these search methods was able to identify different initial guesses for attitude states. Moreover, as a new innovation, these search methods were applied as a powerful tool to select the appropriate inertia ratio for a satellite to deliver periodic responses from the coupled model. Adding the mentioned perturbations to the U-CRTBP could lead to the more accurate modeling of the examination environment and a better understanding of a spacecraft’s natural motion. A comparison between the orbit-attitude natural motions in the unperturbed and perturbed models was also conducted to show this claim.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

However, it is quite challenging as human facial images contain large areas of similar textures, rich expressions, and large rotations. These characteristics also result in the scarcity of large, annotated real-world datasets. We propose a robust and accurate method to learn facial optical flow in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, we utilize various shape priors, including face depth, landmarks, and parsing, to guide the self-supervised learning task via a differentiable nonrigid registration framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable improvements for facial optical flow estimation in the presence of significant expressions and large rotations.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

Most target search studies, especially in robotics, focus on determining either the shortest path when the target’s position is known, or a strategy to find the target as quickly as possible when the target’s position is unknown. However, the target’s position is often known intermittently in the real world, e.g., in the case of using surveillance cameras. Our goal is to help user find a dynamic target efficiently in the real world when the target’s position is intermittently known. In order to achieve this purpose, we have designed an AR guidance assistance system to provide optimal current directional guidance to users, based on searching a prediction graph. We assume that a certain number of depth cameras are fixed in a real scene to obtain dynamic target’s position. The system automatically analyzes all possible meetings between the user and the target, and generates optimal directional guidance to help the user catch up with the target. A user study was used to evaluate our method, and its results showed that compared to free search and a top-view method, our method significantly improves target search efficiency.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

Our key observation is that to recover the underlying structures as well as surface details, given partial input, a fundamental component is a good feature representation that can capture both global structure and local geometric details. We accordingly first propose FSNet, a feature structuring module that can adaptively aggregate point-wise features into a 2D structured feature map by learning multiple latent patterns from local regions. We then integrate FSNet into a coarse-to-fine pipeline for point cloud completion. Specifically, a 2D convolutional neural network is adopted to decode feature maps from FSNet into a coarse and complete point cloud. Next, a point cloud upsampling network is used to generate a dense point cloud from the partial input and the coarse intermediate output. To efficiently exploit local structures and enhance point distribution uniformity, we propose IFNet, a point upsampling module with a self-correction mechanism that can progressively refine details of the generated dense point cloud. We have conducted qualitative and quantitative experiments on ShapeNet, MVP, and KITTI datasets, which demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art point cloud completion approaches.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

In this work, we study a novel and efficient full-duplex strategy network ( FSNet ) to address this issue, by considering a better mutual restraint scheme linking motion and appearance allowing exploitation of cross-modal features from the fusion and decoding stage. Specifically, we introduce a relational cross-attention module (RCAM) to achieve bidirectional message propagation across embedding sub-spaces. To improve the model’s robustness and update inconsistent features from the spatiotemporal embeddings, we adopt a bidirectional purification module after the RCAM. Extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks show that our FSNet is robust to various challenging scenarios (e.g., motion blur and occlusion), and compares well to leading methods both for video object segmentation and video salient object detection.

Capturing human motion accurately from a monocular image sequence remains challenging; modeling quality is strongly influenced by temporal consistency of the captured body motion. Our work presents an elegant solution to integrating temporal constraints during fitting. This increases both temporal consistency and robustness during optimization. In detail, we derive parameters of a sequence of body models, representing shape and motion of a person. We optimize these parameters over the complete image sequence, fitting a single consistent body shape while imposing temporal consistency on the body motion, assuming body joint trajectories to be linear over short time. Our approach enables the derivation of realistic 3D body models from image sequences, including jaw pose, facial expression, and articulated hands. Our experiments show that our approach accurately estimates body shape and motion, even for challenging movements and poses. Further, we apply it to the particular application of sign language analysis, where accurate and temporally consistent motion modelling is essential, and show that the approach is well-suited to this kind of application.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

However, at present, little is known about the impact of residual chlorine on the soil micro-ecological environment. Herein, we treated an experimental soil-plant-microbiome microcosm system by continuous irrigation with a low concentration of chlorine-containing water, and then analyzed the influence on the soil microbial community using metagenomics. After 14-d continuous chlorine treatment, there were no significant lasting effect on soil microbial community diversity and composition either in the rhizosphere or in bulk soil. Although metabolic functions of the rhizosphere microbial community were affected slightly by continuous chlorine treatment, it recovered to the original status. The abundance of several resistance genes changed by 7 d and recovered by 14 d. According to our results, the chlorine residue resulting from daily disinfection may present a slight long-term effect on plant growth (shoot length and fresh weight) and soil micro-ecology. In general, our study assisted with environmental risk assessments relating to the application ofchlorine-containing disinfectants and minimization of risks to the environment during disease control, such as COVID-19.","['Environment', 'Soil Science & Conservation', 'Ecology']"

The synthesized spherical N-CQD nanoparticles in the diameter of about 10 nm had a graphene oxide (GO)-like structure with various oxygen (O)- and nitrogen (N)-containing functional groups. Then N-CQDs were added to MoS 2 nanofluid, and the tribological properties for steel/steel friction pairs were evaluated using a pin-on-disk tribometer. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations for the friction system with MoS 2 or MoS2 + N-CQD nanoparticles were also conducted. The results showed that friction processes with MoS 2 + N-CQD nanofluids were under the mixed lubrication regime. And MoS 2 nanofluid containing 0.4 wt% N-CQDs could achieve 30.4% and 31.0% reduction in the friction coefficient and wear rate, respectively, compared to those without N-CQDs. By analyzing the worn surface topography and chemical compositions, the excellent lubrication performance resulted from the formation of tribochemistry-induced tribofilm. The average thickness of tribofilm was about 13.9 nm, and it was composed of amorphous substances, ultrafine crystalline nanoparticles, and self-lubricating FeSO 4 /Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3 . NEMD simulation results indicated the interaction between S atoms in MoS 2 as well as these O- and N-containing functional groups in N-CQDs with steel surfaces enhanced the stability and strength of tribofilm. Thereby the metal surface was further protected from friction and wear.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"
doi:10.1007/s42064-022-0146-0,en,Robust template feature matching method using motion-constrained DCF designed for visual navigation in asteroid landing,"['OriginalPaper', 'Research Article']","A robust and efficient feature matching method is necessary for visual navigation in asteroid-landing missions. Based on the visual navigation framework and motion characteristics of asteroids, a robust and efficient template feature matching method is proposed to adapt to feature distortion and scale change cases for visual navigation of asteroids. The proposed method is primarily based on a motion-constrained discriminative correlation filter (DCF). The prior information provided by the motion constraints between sequence images is used to provide a predicted search region for template feature matching. Additionally, some specific template feature samples are generated using the motion constraints for correlation filter learning, which is beneficial for training a scale and feature distortion adaptive correlation filter for accurate feature matching. Moreover, average peak-to-correlation energy (APCE) and jointly consistent measurements (JCMs) were used to eliminate false matching. Images captured by the Touch And Go Camera System (TAGCAMS) of the Bennu asteroid were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. In particular, both the robustness and accuracy of region matching and template center matching are evaluated. The qualitative and quantitative results illustrate the advancement of the proposed method in adapting to feature distortions and large-scale changes during spacecraft landing.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

While voxel-based deep learning frameworks have been proposed for this segmentation task, their performance remains limited. In this study, we offer a two-step surface-based deep learning pipeline that achieves significantly better results. Our proposed model takes a surface model of an entire set of principal brain arteries containing aneurysms as input and returns aneurysm surfaces as output. A user first generates a surface model by manually specifying multiple thresholds for time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography images. The system then samples small surface fragments from the entire set of brain arteries and classifies the surface fragments according to whether aneurysms are present using a point-based deep learning network (PointNet++). Finally, the system applies surface segmentation (SO-Net) to surface fragments containing aneurysms.

However, the annotation difference of commonly used primers and reference databases on nematode community is still unclear. We compared two pairs of primers (3NDf/C_1132rmod, NF1F/18Sr2bR) and three databases (NT_v20200604, SILVA138/18s Eukaryota and PR2_v4.5 databases) on the determination of nematode community from four different vegetation types in Changbai Mountain, including mixed broadleaf-conifer forest, dark coniferous forest, betula ermanii Cham and alpine tundra.

A greenhouse study was conducted in which flue gas desulfurization gypsum (FGDG) was applied by using different application methods and rates to two agricultural soils. Phosphorus fertilizer was incorporated into the soils at 2.95 g kg −1 to simulate soil with high P levels. The FGDG was then applied at amounts of 0, 1.5, and 15 g kg −1 soil on either the soil surface or mixed throughout the soil samples to simulate no-tillage and tillage, respectively. Ryegrass was planted after treatment application. The study showed that FGDG reduced runoff DP loss by 33% and leachate DP loss 38% in silt loam soil, and runoff DP loss 46% and leachate DP loss 14% in clay loam soil, at the treatment of 15 g kg − 1 FGDG. Mixing applied method (tillage) provided strong interaction with higher FGDG. To overall effect, the mixing-applied method performed better in controlling DP loss from silt loam soil, while surface-applied (no tillage) showed its advantage in controlling DP loss from clay loam soil. In practice it is necessary to optimize FGDG concentrations, application methods, and DP sources (runoff or leachate) to get maximized benefits of FGDG application. The FGDG application had no negative effects on the soil and ryegrass.","['Environment', 'Soil Science & Conservation', 'Ecology']"

However, the influence of fertilizer and weed species richness interaction is unclear. Nematode abundance and biodiversity in wheat and weed plots soil treated with nitrogen, phosphate and potassium fertilizer addition and weed species richness (0, 1, 2 and 4 weed levels) were investigated in a long-term microcosm experiment established in 2010 at Kaifeng, China. The results demonstrated that fertilizer treatment increased the abundance of total nematode, bacterivores, and plant parasites whereas it decreased the total genera number, the Shannon—Wiener diversity index (H′), Margalef richness index (SR), the total maturity index (ΣMI), and structure index (SI), and degraded the structure of the nematode community. In contrast, weed species richness increased these ecological indices and enhanced the structure of the nematode community. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the fertilizer’s effect was more significant than weed species richness. Redundancy analysis (RDA) demonstrated that fertilizer affected soil nematode mainly through increasing soil available phosphorus by 4.71 times and ammonium nitrogen content by 74.03%; weed species richness increased the diversity indices of soil nematode mainly through enhancing soil moisture by 2.07%.

However, the spatial distribution and the activity-density of termites on a fine-scale in tropical forests are still unknown. We checked the spatial distribution patterns of the feeding groups and species of termites and their co-occurrence pattern in a 1-ha (100 m × 100 m) plot, and their correlation with the environmental factors. We used a standard protocol to collect termite assemblages and classified them into five feeding groups based on their preferred diet: fungus growers, litter feeders, soil feeders, soil-wood feeders, and wood feeders. We measured the environmental factors: soil pH, litter mass, aboveground plant biomass, and topographic position index (TPI). Soil-wood feeders showed the highest activity-density, followed by wood feeders, fungus growers, soil feeders, and litter feeders. Soil-wood feeders and fungus growers demonstated a strong correlation while litter feeders showed weak correlations with other feeding groups.

A 42-day of microcosm incubation was conducted with two soils: a natural watermelon Fusarium wilt pathogen (i.e., Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (FON))-infested soil (Low-FON soil) and the soil further receiving the wilt pathogen inocula (High-FON soil). Both soils were supplemented with four simple sugars before incubation. The results show that, in both soils, FON was enriched by all sugars although co-living with tremendously diverse microbes; and bacterial richness, evenness, and diversity were decreased and bacterial community structure was changed by all sugars. Bacterial richness and evenness were negatively correlated with FON quantity in both Low-FON and High-FON soils, indicating that FON may tend to live in soil with low alpha-diversity. In both Low-FON and High-FON soils, the sugar-spiked networks had more links, higher density, larger modules, and shorter harmonic geodesic distance, suggesting greater potentials for microbial interaction and niche-sharing. The positive links between some of the keystone taxa and FON indicates that these keystone taxa may have promoted FON.

To establish a new class of OFMs, we measured the friction and wear properties of N-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-oxyl-4-piperidinyl)dodecaneamide referred to as C 12 Amide-TEMPO. The effect of its head group chemistry, which is characterized by a rigid six-membered ring sandwiched by an amide group and a terminal free oxygen radical, was also investigated with both experiments and quantum mechanical (QM) calculations. The measurement results show that C 12 Amide-TEMPO outperforms the conventional OFMs of glyceryl monooleate (GMO) and stearic acid, particularly for load-carrying capacity, wear reduction, and stability of friction over time. The friction and wear reduction effect of C 12 Amide-TEMPO is also greatly superior to those of C 12 Ester-TEMPO and C 12 Amino-TEMPO, in which ester and amino groups replace the amide group, highlighting the critical role of the amide group. The QM calculation results suggest that, in contrast to C 12 Ester-TEMPO, C 12 Amino-TEMPO, and the conventional OFMs of GMO and stearic acid, C 12 Amide-TEMPO can form effective boundary films on iron oxide surfaces with a unique double-layer structure: a strong surface adsorption layer owing to the chemical interactions of the amide oxygen and free radical with iron oxide surfaces, and an upper layer owing to the interlayer hydrogen-bonding between the amide hydrogen and free radical or between the amide hydrogen and oxygen. Moreover, the intralayer hydrogen-bonding in each of the two layers is also possible. We suggest that in addition to strong surface adsorption, the interlayer and intralayer hydrogen-bonding also increases the strength of the boundary films by enhancing the cohesion strength, thereby resulting in the high tribological performance of C 12 Amide-TEMPO. The findings in this study are expected to provide new hints for the optimal molecular design of OFMs.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

Photovoltaic production from grid-connected systems is leading this growth in terms of households. Alongside this development, concern about network security has emerged, because excesses of intermittent renewable energy on the grid could exceed voltage limits. Self-consumption, understood as the capacity of the producer to consume his or her own production, can partially solve these problems. Thermostatic controllable loads, such as heating and cooling, represent 50% of the total amount of energy consumed by buildings; the proper allocation of these loads could be a driving force for self-consumption. In this study, a demand side management strategy is proposed based on a building energy model equipped with an inverter heat pump coupled with a photovoltaic plant. The goal is to maximize the use of local energy from the photovoltaic plant (self-consumption), reducing the export and import of energy to and from the grid. This goal is achieved by optimizing the set-points in each room. An array of optimal set-points over six years is presented. The results show the capacity of the methodology to match similar values of self-consumption (70% in winter and 50% in summer) obtained by strategies based on chemical batteries. The findings are shown in an energy matching chart at different levels of detail (yearly and monthly). Color bubbles are added to the matching chart to help visualize the unmatched energy of the system graphically.

We can generate complex signals through simple signals, just as we can construct a building using basic components. It is necessary to determine the main signals. Once we determine the main signals, we can generate more complex signals from these main signals. The first of the main signals is the sinusoidal signal. The sinusoidal signal can be obtained using a bipolar magnet and copper wire. The signal obtained in this way is an electrical signal. It is possible to obtain the DC voltage signal from the sine voltage signal by means of rectifiers. It is also possible to obtain square wave, impulse, and very narrow-spaced rectangular (impulse array) wave sequences by means of electrical circuits. An exponential voltage wave is observed during the discharge of the capacitor on the resistor. Once we have the fundamental waves, we can create other more complex waves. We can list the basic signals we use as follows: unit step signal, unit impulse signal, square wave signal, sinusoidal signal, exponential decaying signal, complex sine signal, etc.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Coding and Information Theory', 'Algorithms']"

Graphs or networks are usually used to model relational structures. And researches of graphs have attracted extensive attentions recently, the most important of which is graph representation learning, i.e., learning node embedding representations for downstream tasks. In this chapter, we first introduce some basic concepts and definitions in graph representation learning, and discuss the development of the advanced graph representation learning methods, i.e., graph neural networks. We also emphasize several frontier aspects of graph neural networks mentioned in the book and further conclude the organization of the book in this chapter.","['Mathematics', 'Graph Theory', 'Computer Science, general', 'Mathematical Applications in Computer Science', 'Mathematical Models of Cognitive Processes and Neural Networks', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery']"

Abstraction is an effective tool for managing the complexity of these integrated systems. The abstract models described in this chapter exclusively focus on information relevant to a specific design objective. A graph is an effective tool for managing the complexity of large scale VLSI systems. By reducing the complex components of a VLSI system into nodes and edges, the design effort can be concentrated on the key features of a system while discarding extraneous information. The significance of graph theory at every abstraction layer of the VLSI design process is discussed in this chapter. At the register transfer layer, register allocation is often achieved by graph coloring, minimizing the communication between the CPU and memory. Ordered binary decision diagrams and AND-inverter graphs enable efficient graph-based processing of logic circuits. Graph-based techniques, such as random walks and network flow theory, facilitate the circuit analysis process of VLSI systems. Physical design is greatly enhanced by applying graph optimization algorithms to circuit partitioning, floorplanning, placement, and routing.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems']"

Their main feature is the capability of processing graph structured data with minimal loss of structural information. This makes GNNs the ideal family of models for processing a wide variety of biological data: metabolic networks, structural formulas of molecules, and proteins are all examples of biological data that are naturally represented as graphs. As an example, GNNs were employed, with very good results, for the prediction of protein-protein interactions. This was achieved by applying a clique detection model on graphs representing the interaction of the secondary structures of pairs of proteins. The introduction of composite GNN models, designed for processing heterogeneous graphs, has allowed researchers to study even more complex networks. For instance, drug side-effects were predicted based on a graph describing the interactions between drugs and human genes. Another very important innovation was brought by generative models, that were introduced for graph data after the success of generative models for images. In particular, GNNs were used to build a sequential model for the generation of potential drug candidates, in the form of molecular graphs, with the purpose of enhancing existing drug discovery techniques. The increasing accuracy and efficacy of these models, as well as the development of more complex biological databases, ensure even more interesting future developments in the application of GNNs to biological data.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Health Informatics']"

In some cases, however, the amount of data is still not sufficiently large (e.g. in some machine learning applications). Data augmentation is a widely used mechanism to increase the available data in such cases. Current augmentation methods are mostly developed for statistical data and only a small part of these methods is directly applicable to graphs. In a recent research project, a novel encoding of pairwise graph matchings is introduced. The basic idea of this encoding, termed matching-graph, is to formalize the stable cores of pairs of patterns by means of graphs. In the present paper, we propose to use these matching-graphs to augment training sets of graphs in order to stabilize the training process of state-of-the-art graph neural networks. In an experimental evaluation on five graph data sets, we show that this novel augmentation technique is able to significantly improve the classification accuracy of three different neural network models.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computers and Education', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.

Recent contributions delved into the usage of Gradient-descent (GD) based schemes to optimize differentiable loss functions, built to measure the graph layout adherence to given layout characteristics. However, some properties cannot be easily expressed via differentiable functions. In this direction, the recently proposed Graph Neural Drawer (GND) framework proposes to exploit the representational capability of neural models in order to be able to express differentiable losses, specifically for edge intersection, that can be subsequently optimized via GD. In this paper, we propose to improve graph layout readability leveraging linear splines. We exploit the principles behind GND and use a neural model both to identify crossing edges and to optimize their relative position. We split crossing edges introducing linear splines, and threat the control points as novel “fake” vertices that can be optimized via the underlying layout optimization process. We provide qualitative and quantitative analysis over multiple graphs and optimizing different aesthetic losses, that show how the proposed method is a viable solution.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computers and Education', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.

Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) aims to represent entities and relations into low-dimensional vector spaces and has gained extensive attention. However, recent studies show that KGEs can be easily misled by slight perturbation, such as adding or deleting one knowledge fact on the training data, also called adversarial attack. In this paper, we propose an adversarial defense mechanism against attacks on KGE for the first time. Two stages are designed for defense, including offline stage and online stage . Given a manipulated knowledge graph, the former develops a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework to assist the training of KGE against attack, namely, adversarial training. The latter combines a sub-graph generation method with link prediction as preprocessing strategies to detect perturbations, namely, perturbation detection. The combination of two stages makes it perform well against adding attacks by filtering possible perturbations using perturbation detection before adversarial training. The experimental results demonstrate our method has better performance in defending the state-of-the-art attacks.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Security Science and Technology']"

Contrary to existing mappings, our solution preserves the three fundamental mapping properties, namely: information preservation, semantic preservation and query preservation . Moreover, we study mapping any SQL query into an equivalent Cypher query, which makes our solution practical. Existing solutions are either incomplete or based on non-practical query language.

In the loss function used for training, we used Simpson coefficient to measure the overlapping of graphs. The degree of inclusion was measured as cosine similarity of the obtained vectors. To evaluate the method, we used card images of competitive Karuta. The adjacency of letters on the card was represented as a graph, and lack of recognized letters under the realistic environment such as under sunlight or shadow gives a subgraph of the graph for the card.

A class of these mining activities is conformance (compliance) checking. The goal is to identify the violation of such patterns, i.e., anti-patterns. Several approaches have been proposed to tackle this analysis task. These approaches have been based on different data models and storage technologies of the event log including relational databases, graph databases, and proprietary formats. Graph-based encoding of event logs is a promising direction that turns several process analytic tasks into queries on the underlying graph. Compliance checking is one class of such analysis tasks. In this paper, we argue that encoding log data as graphs alone is not enough to guarantee efficient processing of queries on this data. Efficiency is important due to the interactive nature of compliance checking. Thus, anti-pattern detection would benefit from sub-linear scanning of the data. Moreover, as more data are added, e.g., new batches of logs arrive, the data size should grow sub-linearly to optimize both the space of storage and time for querying. We propose two encoding methods using graph representations, realized in Neo4J & SQL Graph Database, and show the benefits of these encoding on a special class of queries, namely timed ordered anti-patterns. Compared to several baseline encoding, our experiments show up to 5 x speed up in the querying time as well as a 3 x reduction in the graph size.","['Computer Science', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Computer Communication Networks', 'Database Management', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.

Instability refers to a behavior in which large plastic strains are generated rapidly when a soil element sustains a given load or stress. Currently, the research related to instability of soils is primarily conducted at saturated conditions through undrained triaxial tests on loose saturated soils (e.g., Lade, J Geotech Eng 118:51–72, 1992; Leong et al., Geotech Test J 23:178–192, 2000; Yang, Geotechnique 52:757–760, 2002) and drained constant shear tests on saturated medium and dense sands (Chu et al., Can Geotech J 40:873–885, 2003). However, many natural soil deposits encountered in engineering practice are often unsaturated. During rainfall infiltration, a reduction in soil suction causes a decrease in the shear strength, which leads to the development of plastic strains and ultimately to the instability of the soil. This process can be idealized as a wetting path along which the shear stress and net mean stress keep constant, but the suction decreases over time. However, the instability behavior of unsaturated granular soils along the wetting path has seldom been investigated.","['Engineering', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences']"

The engine concept accepts a single input and forming clusters from the single starting point based on chain queries. It can then run the required algorithms on the clusters formed to select the best-fit data. The recommendation engine uses Neo4j as the database.

The physical system comprises a rigid link that is free to rotate about an axis. It is actuated using a servo control mechanism.

Three feedbacks are taken from the system: Current in the stator windings, the angular velocity of the motor, and position of the rigid link. The bond graph approach is used to model the dynamics of the system. This approach takes causality into account which describes the cause and effect relationship of the elements with the system. System equations are derived using the developed bond graph model. Simulink models are also developed based on the bond graph model. Simulation for step, cosine, ramp, and parabolic inputs is performed and the result for the step and ramp inputs are presented.

This chapter aims to summarize the current research efforts concerning the testing and analysis of the creep and the creep recovery of cementitious materials at both macro and micro scales. The instrumented indentation technique is used to evaluate the creep behavior of cementitious materials at both nano and micro scales. A strong analogy of the logarithmic creep behavior is found between the cementitious materials and the soils, and the creep modulus is an intrinsic parameter that reflects the long-term creep rate of cement paste. A dashpot with a variable viscosity that increases linearly with time can capture the logarithmic creep behavior. In addition, the ratio of the recoverable creep to the total creep can be obtained based on the measured results using two indentation schemes, i.e., the “loading-holding-unloading-reholding” scheme and the “loading-unloading-reholding” scheme, and the recoverable creep can account for up to 0.41 of the total creep.

Especially, conditional random fields (CRF) and Potts model have been used in connection with classifiers. In this work, we focus on the Potts model and use image segmentation and data classification as examples to show some new techniques and fast algorithms for this model. We survey different piecewise constant representation techniques. Many of these representations can be interpreted as min-cut and max-flow problems on some special graphs. We will concentrate especially on the continuous setting and formulate continuous min-cut and max-flow models. When the min-cut/max-flow models are discretized, they give corresponding discrete min-cut/max-flow models on grids. Using these connections, we are able to turn the non-convex Potts model into some simple convex minimization problems with solutions that can be obtained by properly designed fast algorithms. In this survey, we will start by introducing some widely studied variational segmentation models and the classical level-set approaches to solve them. Then, we will describe three different piecewise constant representations for the general Potts model and their corresponding convex relaxations and fast algorithms. In the end, we will also generalize the method to a graph setting for high-dimensional data classifications.

Even though the grade of concrete is identical, environmental exposure conditions with respect to water–cement ratio significantly controls the quantities of ingredients of concrete. Properties of fresh concrete such as slump value and compaction factor are changing with respect to cement content. It is possible to determine relations between them. Experimentation had been carried out under different water–cement ratios (0.3, 0.36, 0.4, 0.45 and 0.5) with and without the use of chemical admixture to establish graphical relationships. Mechanical properties are determined with respect to age and the effect of admixture. Suggested fresh concrete relations are quite suitable for concretes with and without utilization of chemical admixtures. Workability of concrete depends upon the dose of chemical admixtures such as superplasticizer and time-period after mixing of all ingredients of concrete. Sincere effort had been made to establish the relationship among slump loss, time-period after mixing and dosage of ingredients for different water–cement ratios through graphical representation. Relationship among water–cement ratio, quantity of cement per cubic meter, slump in mm and compaction factor are determined. The quantity of ingredients with respect to various environmental exposure conditions with and without chemical admixture is presented graphically. It was observed that slump values versus cement content and compaction factor show linear variation. Experiments show desired compressive strength couldn’t be achieved without superplasticizer in case of higher grade concrete.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Construction Management', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering']"

Traditionally, engineers or experts are required to inspect and assess the tunnel structure on site regularly. But most of the assessment are subjective and qualitative, failing to achieve reasonable assessment and accurate tunnel maintenance operation. Therefore, some quantitative methods, such as Tunnel Servility Index (TSI), are proposed. However, TSI method only assesses the current condition of a tunnel, without considering its historical monitoring data. With the development of geotechnical engineering, large amount of monitoring data has been recorded. These data are multi-source heterogeneous, making it rather difficult to store and analyse. Database technology, especially Knowledge Graph (KG), is good at storing, managing and mining multi-source heterogeneous data. Based on KG, all data related to tunnel structure can be stored and then taken into account when making assessment; besides, the information of a tunnel from its construction to the present can be recorded in the knowledge graph. In the paper, monitoring data of Shanghai Metro Line 1 is stored in Neo4j, a graph database, to form the metro tunnel knowledge graph. Based on the KG, the metro tunnel is assessed by a dynamic assessment model based on TSI method. The hided statistic relationships among defects are also deduced. Through the application of KG on Shanghai Metro Line 1, the dynamic assessment model is proposed to be effective, reliable and advanced.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Statistics, general']"

The increased need for tunnel infrastructure in urban areas demands tunnel excavation using Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) to avoid surface traffic disturbance during the project execution period. The construction of Mega Tunnels provides a successful and profitable solution for urban development. Mega Tunnel is a large-diameter tunnel in which the diameter is greater than 10 m. The construction of Mega Tunnels involves more cost of construction for the station, as we must go deeper for stability purposes. Face Stability of such types of tunnels has been a hot topic for researchers, as this issue gets more critical with the increase in tunnel diameter. The collapse pressure plays an important role in the face stability of tunnels with increased overburden. Therefore, with the advantage of mega tunnel construction, ground-induced settlement and deformation should be taken into account. This paper focuses on the ground-induced settlement at various cover to diameter (C/D) ratios. The parametric study had been done by three-dimensional finite element analysis using Midas Gtx Nx software with different C/D ratios and pressure parameters for soft soil. The diameter of the tunnel is considered as 15 m. The analysis showed that the application of requisite pressures plays a significant role in the face stability of mega tunnels. Conclusions were drawn based upon analysis, and approximate preliminary lining thickness was suggested for different C/D ratios, which will be beneficial to ascertain preliminary tunnel design in actual practice.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Construction Management', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering']"

The first survey was addressed to all the citizens of Damanhur, 56 percent of whom replied personally, while for 44 percent the replies were given by the head of the “nucleus”, that is, the typical housing aggregate where the members of the Community live. The second survey consisted of a sample survey, with a survey fraction of 37 percent, conducted through a questionnaire given to a sample of nine “nuclei” selected by random sampling. Through the results of the two surveys it was possible to have a general overview of the main aspects of the Community. From the socio-demographic point of view it was possible to delineate the distributions of citizens by age group, gender, educational qualification, current profession and profession at the time of entering the Community, geographical area of origin, the “nucleus” where one resides and possible mobility of residents among the “nuclei”. In particular we wanted to deepen both the working dimension (therefore the total and specific employment rates by sex, place of work, sectors of activity and professional choices) and the consumption models, such as the places of purchase, the type of goods/services purchased and the distribution of one’s own expenses among different items (for work, family members, physical and mental well-being, personal growth paths). So we wanted to investigate the relationship between the subject and the Community through the relationship between the individual citizen and the “nuclei”, the time dedicated to community activities and volunteering. The chapter concludes with the opinions of residents about community economic strategies such as the organization of the welfare system and the entrepreneurial and economic choices, including from a diachronic perspective.","['Religious Studies', 'Spirituality', 'History of World War II and the Holocaust']"

The base isolation substantially decouples a structure from its base resting on the shaking ground, thus safeguarding the integrity of the structure by making them sustain the seismic forces without damage and also protect the lives of occupants. In the present study, an investigation is done to assess the seismic response of the structure with conventional fixed base and isolated base conditions. The isolation is configured with an elastomeric rubber isolator analyzed and designed in accordance with the International Building Code, IBC:2000. The analytical study is performed using ETAB application software and the experimentation is done using a uniaxial shake table on 1:12.5 scaled-down steel model developed using similitude laws corresponding to G + 3 and G + 5 prototype building frame. The study is carried out by applying three time histories, namely El-Centro, Uttarkashi and Indo-Burma. The fixed base condition is simulated in the laboratory by directly bolting the model on the shake table. The isolated base condition is simulated by mounting the model on an elastomeric rubber isolator. The study reveals that the acceleration produced in the base-isolated structure is reduced in the range of 40–60% in comparison with the fixed base condition. Pseudo spectral acceleration corresponding to fixed and isolated base conditions is obtained, which reveals that the time period of base-isolated structure increased to almost 2.5 s from 0.5 s. The shift in time period resulted in depletion in various parameters such as energy demand, pseudo acceleration and reinforcement requirement. The cumulative energy demand throughout the event of an earthquake is also studied. The reduction in energy demand for the isolated base condition is observed to be 50–90% lesser than in the fixed base condition. The reinforcement demand is reduced to 50% in isolated base condition. Thus, the study reveals that base isolation reduces the seismic demand of structure and enhanced safety, thereby reducing the cost of the structure.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Construction Management', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering']"

doi:10.1007/978-981-19-6641-5_8,en,Climate-Sensitive Urban Design for Thermal Comfort,OriginalPaper,"Urban and microclimate have an intense relationship that affects each other. The specific urban structure can affect microclimate because of the high radiation generated. On the other side, urban structure blocks the distribution of incoming wind. Urban structure changes how the microclimate influences the city. The successful urban structure can impact how outdoor open spaces are used meanwhile good open spaces are affected by how comfortable can be accepted. In addition, water and greenery space is an essential urban part and has a vital environmental implication in alleviating the urban heat island (UHI). This chapter analysed thermal comfort in cold coastal areas and tropical areas. Especially in the cold coastal areas, this chapter chooses 3 plots of land used for education, 2 used as parks, 6 for commercial use, 2 for industrial land, 11 for residential land, and 6 for other land-use types. Because the field measurement points are scattered throughout the city, and the numbers of measurement instruments and researchers are limited, the 30 points are divided into five groups. Through simultaneous tests at the same period and time interval, the degree of difference in the urban thermal environment under different land categories and building types is analyzed. Through research, we found that the coupling relationship between outdoor environmental performance (OEP) and BH is analyzed qualitatively at different ranges. The maximum R 2 is 0.9052, the minimum is 0.3813, and the average is 0.80, indicating an apparent quadratic polynomial relationship between AT and BH within 500 m. In addition, the coupling strength between BH and RH is relatively high. The coupling relationship between AT and BH appears to be the opposite of RH and BH. The data are also highly discrete, so there is no clear relationship between BH and WS. Coupling strength in the range of 100 m, 300 m, 700 m, and 900 m is not as strong as that of 500 m, showing higher data dispersion and a smaller R 2 value. So urban structures must be well designed to make wind release the heat trapped in the urban area. This chapter also takes urban green infrastructure of Tianjin in China as a case, using subjective and objective analysis and model simulation. Waterfront compound greenery’s cooling effect was found more significant at waterfront 3–6 m, where the location was suitable for construction. When the green lawn of the waterfront space was 12 m and the water shore’s geometric form was S-shaped, this could improve the cooling effect of water significantly. This chapter provides practical implications and useful guidance for the urban planning and design.","['Life Sciences', 'Urban Ecology', 'Sustainable Development', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Cities, Countries, Regions']"

The question posed was if it is possible to identify subgraphs whose congestion that may lead to the blockade of the entire network, i.e. if there are dominant subgraphs in the network. We resort to semi-supervised trained Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to formulate and solve the problem. For traffic networks structured as streets or subway lines, the notion of subgraph dominance is very intuitive, because we can postulate that if the labeling of the graph assigns a line label to many nodes belonging to other lines, then the flow in this line should affect these nodes and their corresponding lines. We have carried out experimental work over a manageable network, the Vienna subway network, achieving high and robust accuracy results in the semi-supervised labeling process. However, line dominance results are less robust, they seem to be highly influenced by the experimental setting given by the actual seed nodes provided to networks, which calls for further experiments and analysis in order to try to find stable responses.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

In IoT, the sensor nodes typically possess heterogeneous properties. Among, few nodes have higher energy and even data aggregation functionality. Generally, in WSNs, efficient cluster-based routing is employed for data transmission. When Cluster Head (CH) fails, data sensed by the sensor nodes cannot be transmitted by the faulty CH. Consequently, the gateway or sink cannot recognize the data in the IoT sufficiently. Hence, processing information in this field was severely affected. This research contribution focuses on paired fault-tolerant cluster routing of the disjoint routes in a data flow graph and introduces a new approach called Free Poisson Law for solving this problem. The proposed Efficient Data Flow Graph Modeling using Free Poisson Law (EDFGM-FPL) algorithm has the aim of reducing latency, energy consumption as well as end-to-end delay, dissipated energy, functional complexity thereby achieving improved packet delivery ratio, throughput, and fault detection rate.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Statistics, general']"

Within the populations of interest, it is useful to assess the similarity of structures, in order to form communities and networks; i.e., to establish clusters. By doing so, it is possible to infer whether transfer learning is likely to be applicable across a population. To address this, structures are represented in graphical form via irreducible element (IE) models or attributed graphs (AG), that encompass the topology, material properties and geometry of the structures. Kernel-based methods – also known as graph kernels – can then be applied to these IEs and AGs to assess the similarities within the population. In this paper, a number of comparisons are made between graphical representations of structures at different levels of resolution; these vary from assessing similarity at a purely topological level, to an increase in complexity, where discrete and continuous node labels are evaluated via graph kernels.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The key component of EBO analysis is determining the best set of actions for maximization of a desired effect or minimization of an undesired effect. EBOs are analyzed using knowledge graphs. Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) are one method of analytically representing and solving knowledge graphs. Integrating a fuzzy inference system on each node of a knowledge graph allows for the traditional relational weight matrix to be replaced with fuzzy rule sets allowing for more uncertainty in relational effect weights. This reflects real world uncertainty in wartime, political, or other planning environments. Using a genetic algorithm also decreases the vast search space of possible knowledge graph solutions.

The operating frequency achieved by RSFQ digital integrated circuits is several orders of magnitude greater than traditional CMOS circuits. The fundamental difference of RSFQ circuits, however, renders traditional clocking techniques appropriate for CMOS unsuitable for RSFQ technology. Most RSFQ logic gates, such as AND and OR, are sequential in nature. The number of pipeline stages is therefore significantly greater in RSFQ as compared to CMOS, complicating the clock distribution network design process. This issue is further exacerbated with the need for splitters to achieve a fanout greater than one and the need for transmission lines rather than ordinary metallic wires as in CMOS. In this work, QuCTS – single flux Quantum Clock Tree Synthesis – is presented. QuCTS utilizes a three stage framework for synthesizing clock networks. In the clock skew scheduling stage, the clock signal arrival time of each gate is chosen to maximize the robustness of the circuit to timing variations. In the clock tree topology stage, a topological graph of a binary clock tree is generated. In the clock tree synthesis stage, the layout of the clock distribution network is generated based on a novel proxy graph technique. QuCTS is the first clock tree synthesis tool for RSFQ circuits to exploit useful clock skew. The synthesized network satisfies the clock arrival time requirements while minimizing the associated overhead, such as the interconnect length and number of delay elements. The tool is validated on a set of benchmark circuits. In a prototypical case study, a clock tree for the AMD2901 with 1,049 clock sinks is generated in 53 minutes while satisfying the clock skew schedule.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems']"

For example, if the launch date of a new product has changed many times, the company might want to know to which people the most current information has reached. In the propagation model we consider, the social network is represented as a directed graph, and an agent (node) updates its state if it receives a stronger opinion (updated information) and then forwards the opinion in accordance with the direction of its edges. Previous work evaluated opinion propagation in a social network by using the probably approximately correct (PAC) learning framework and considered only binary opinions. In general, PAC learnability, i.e., the finiteness of the number of samples needed, is not guaranteed when generalizing from a binary-value model to a multi-value model. We show that the PAC learnability of multi-value opinions propagating in a social network. We first prove that the number of samples needed in a multi-opinion model is sufficient for $$(k-1)\log (k-1)$$ ( k - 1 ) log ( k - 1 ) times the number of samples needed in a binary-opinion model, when $$k~(\ge 3)$$ k ( ≥ 3 ) is the number of opinions.

The analysis of the obtained solutions to the synthesis problem is carried out. As a result, n optimal variant of the structural diagram of such a device is presented. Possible variants of constructive solutions for some units of the device corresponding to the synthesized structural diagram are shown. It was found that the presence of the proposed method for evaluating the input signal and its transformation for control corresponds to a self-adjusting system with a mechanical control system.","['Engineering', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Engineering Design', 'Materials Engineering']"

As a mechanism for changing or forming one’s opinion or behavior, persuasive dialogues and their strategies have gained interest for developing intelligent conversational systems. Given the complexity of this task, persuasion systems, especially dealing in conversations that require ‘no action’ by the user but rather a change in opinion or belief, require specialized annotated corpora and the understanding of logical structure, natural language, and persuasive strategies. The sparsity of available annotated data and a wide range of proposed models make it challenging for developing strategic chatbots specific to user needs. To address these issues, this study introduces a novel framework combining a replicable data collection tool and a topic-independent annotation schema for designing an argument-graph corpus and incorporating both persuader and persuadee perspectives, essential for building smart conversational agents.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Fault behavior analysis aims to find out the response characteristics of operating parameters under different faults and is the most primitive task for multiple faults diagnosis. This paper proposes a bond graph-based approach to analyse the mechanical fault behavior for diagnosis. The analytical model of an engineering system is firstly established via bond graph. The temporal causal graph is derived from the bond graph model to depict the analytic relationships system variables. The operating parameters response characteristics under different faults are then derived by representing the faults with abnormal change of system variables. The approach is illustrated via an engine lubrication system.

RDF storage systems are actively used for storing, sharing, and publishing RDF data on the Internet. RDF models are used in business applications and by research teams who wish to share their data with the community. Generally, most RDF stores are optimized for queries, but usually, this is achieved at the cost of increased disk space consumption. Renting a dedicated server with a large volume of local storage is quite expensive, especially for small research teams and business startups which makes it an important factor in choosing the data storage. In this study we compared disk space usage of four popular triple storage which can serve as SPARQL (an SQL-like query language) endpoints, depending on the amount and structure of the loaded RDF data. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has compared the disk space occupied by triple stores. We found that all of the compared open-source solutions, namely Apache Jena Fuseki, consume large amounts of hard disk space and should be used with caution in resource-limited environments. The data structure – one large graph or many smaller named graphs – strongly affected Parliament’s disk space usage so it also should be taken into account when selecting an RDF storage. Free versions of commercial systems show adequate disk consumption and appear to be weakly dependent on data structure, but Ontotext GraphDb is deliberately limited in performance, and Stardog is limited in license term and may need additional manual maintenance.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The SPL itself is managed automatically in a transparent repository by the system. As a consequence, developers may re-use the same engineering tools they also used for the development of the product variants prior to the re-engineering process. SuperMod furthermore orchestrates collaborative development and provides dedicated support for (without restricting developers to) model-driven approaches to SPL engineering. We illustrate SuperMod’s capabilities by the well-known graph SPL example and discuss the practical benefits of the suggested solution to SPL evolution as well as its relation to SPL re-engineering.","['Computer Science', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Software Management', 'Computer System Implementation']"

Our previous work studied a routing problem for two vehicles that can return to HQ multiple times on the way to minimize the average delay time of incrementally collecting information. However, such a joint optimization of the vehicles’ routes will be complicated in a large area.

doi:10.1007/978-981-16-7487-7_7,en,A Modern Primer on Processing in Memory,OriginalPaper,"Modern computing systems are overwhelmingly designed to move data to computation. This design choice goes directly against at least three key trends in computing that cause performance, scalability and energy bottlenecks: (1) data access is a key bottleneck as many important applications are increasingly data-intensive, and memory bandwidth and energy do not scale well, (2) energy consumption is a key limiter in almost all computing platforms, especially server and mobile systems, (3) data movement, especially off-chip to on-chip, is very expensive in terms of bandwidth, energy and latency, much more so than computation. These trends are especially severely-felt in the data-intensive server and energy-constrained mobile systems of today. At the same time, conventional memory technology is facing many technology scaling challenges in terms of reliability, energy, and performance. As a result, memory system architects are open to organizing memory in different ways and making it more intelligent, at the expense of higher cost. The emergence of 3D-stacked memory plus logic, the adoption of error correcting codes inside the latest DRAM chips, proliferation of different main memory standards and chips, specialized for different purposes (e.g., graphics, low-power, high bandwidth, low latency), and the necessity of designing new solutions to serious reliability and security issues, such as the RowHammer phenomenon, are an evidence of this trend. This chapter discusses recent research that aims to practically enable computation close to data, an approach we call processing-in-memory (PIM). PIM places computation mechanisms in or near where the data is stored (i.e., inside the memory chips, in the logic layer of 3D-stacked memory, or in the memory controllers), so that data movement between the computation units and memory is reduced or eliminated. While the general idea of PIM is not new, we discuss motivating trends in applications as well as memory circuits/technology that greatly exacerbate the need for enabling it in modern computing systems. We examine at least two promising new approaches to designing PIM systems to accelerate important data-intensive applications: (1)  processing using memory by exploiting analog operational properties of DRAM chips to perform massively-parallel operations in memory, with low-cost changes, (2)  processing near memory by exploiting 3D-stacked memory technology design to provide high memory bandwidth and low memory latency to in-memory logic. In both approaches, we describe and tackle relevant cross-layer research, design, and adoption challenges in devices, architecture, systems, and programming models. Our focus is on the development of in-memory processing designs that can be adopted in real computing platforms at low cost. We conclude by discussing work on solving key challenges to the practical adoption of PIM.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Electronic Circuits and Devices', 'Processor Architectures', 'Nanotechnology', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation']"

The lack of garbage bins in needed areas, as well as the overflow of already existing bins at public locations prior to the start of the next cleaning process, is a major problem in waste management. This, in turn, causes different threats to that location, such as bad odor and ugliness, which may be the root cause of the spread of various diseases. This project is based on a smart waste management system to avoid any potentially dangerous scenarios and to maintain public cleanliness and health. This project proposes an IoT-based smart waste management system that uses sensor devices to monitor the waste level in the bins. When the bin fills up to 80%, the system detects it and immediately alerts the appropriate authorities, who then organize garbage pickup. A smartphone application is being created to monitor and integrate this, as well as to make it easier for citizens to locate the bins. This project reviews the use of Geographic Information System (GIS) in the field of MSWM in Kakkanad. Kakkanad is located in the eastern part of the Ernakulam district. Kakkanad is the major industrial and residential region in the city of Kochi thus making it one of the most critical areas of waste generation.

This can be useful for the analysis and interpretation of simulations. However, multi-agent simulations shift the paradigm of chained causal relations to multiple levels of detail and abstraction. Thus, conventional cause-effect graphs need to be extended to capture the hierarchical structure of causal relations in multi-agent models. In this paper, we present a graphical modelling method that we call Multi-Agent Modelling Notation (MAMN) , with which global aspects of the simulation as well as detailed interior mechanisms of agent behaviour can be described. We give proof of concept by showing how the logic that connects individual agent behaviour to global outcomes in a previously published simulation model can be expressed in a concise diagrammatic form.

FLPs defined on graphs are very general and broadly applicable. Two such fundamental FLPs are the Vertex K -Center (VKC) and the Vertex K -Median (VKM) problems. Although both these problems are NP-hard, many heuristic and approximation algorithms have been developed for solving them in practice. However, state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms require the input graph G to be complete, in which the edge joining two vertices is also the shortest path between them. When G doesn’t satisfy this property, these heuristic algorithms have to be invoked only after computing the metric closure of G , which in turn requires the computation of all-pairs shortest-path (APSP) distances. Existing APSP algorithms, such as the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, have a poor time complexity, making APSP computations a bottleneck for deploying the heuristic algorithms on large VKC and VKM instances. To remedy this, we propose the use of a novel algorithmic pipeline based on a graph embedding algorithm called FastMap. FastMap is a near-linear-time algorithm that embeds the vertices of G in a Euclidean space while approximately preserving the shortest-path distances as Euclidean distances for all pairs of vertices. The FastMap embedding can be used to circumvent the barrier of APSP computations, creating a very efficient pipeline for solving FLPs. On the empirical front, we provide test results that demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our novel approach.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Using only relative observations, a distributed nonlinear weighted least squares algorithm is proposed to co-localize the position and orientation of each robot. Firstly, Gauss-Newton method is utilized to decompose the nonlinear problem into a series of linear weighted least squares (WLS) steps. Then, in order to handle the linear WLS problem, an algebraic distributed method which performs finite step convergence under acyclic communication graphs is introduced, and the performance of this method is equivalent to the centralized WLS. In particular, the convergence rate of this method is only related to the diameter of the communication graph, and the computational complexity of each robot does not increase as the communication graph becomes large. Moreover, it turns out that the proposed collaborative localization algorithm is exponentially convergence under cyclic communication graphs. Finally, numerical experiments are used to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Multiagent Systems', 'Systems Theory, Control']"

The parameter such as non-recoverable creep compliance, percentage recovery, and retardation time depends on the temperature. The sensitivity of these parameters with the variation in the temperature is studied. This experimental investigation is carried out using one unmodified and one modified binder, and the test was carried out at unaged and short-term aged condition. The temperature regime of interest for this study is 40–70 °C. Multiple stress creep and recovery (MSCR) and steady shear tests were performed. MSCR tests were conducted using parallel plate geometry at 40, 50, 60, and 70 °C. The tests were conducted for two stress levels of 0.1 and 3.2 kPa. The steady shear viscosity at two different shear rates was also measured at these temperatures. The creep and recovery response of the bitumen at two different stress levels was found to be scalable, and Burgers’ model was used to predict the creep and recovery response of the bitumen. The Arrhenius constant for different binders and different aging conditions was determined using the viscosity data obtained from the steady shear test. The material functions such as creep compliance, percentage recovery, and retardation time were determined based on the experimental and model results. These parameters were observed to follow Arrhenius relationship in the temperature range of 40–70 °C.","['Engineering', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Sustainable Development']"

In an electric resistance furnace, the electrical power translates thermal energy using convection and eradiation law. In resistance furnaces, metals’ heating operations and melting are below 1200℃. The maximum temperature is limited to electric heating elements and inefficient furnace design due to the electrical heating elements’ frequent burnout due to overheating and surface oxidation, resulting in more significant downtime. This research addresses these challenges and other performance-related issues through optimization techniques. ANSYS simulation software was used for optimization purposes. Performed tests under two different design alternatives of actual conditions for melting three-light metals: lead, aluminum, and brass, as sample materials have low, intermediate, and high-temperature behaviors. Simulation results were compared, and validation was performed. The results show that it is possible to use electrical resistance furnaces for melting a greater quantity of metal and achieve rapid heating rates than the currently available designs. The thermal efficiency ranges from 64, 88, and 89%, and the volumetric efficiency of 23, 45, and 67%. The achieved results are best suitable for small, medium, and large furnaces.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Materials Engineering']"

Visual plant disease analysis is a modern technique to handle this problem, following recent developments in imaging. In this study, we look at the challenge of plant disease detection which is visually done for identification of plant disease. Plant disease images, in comparison with other types of photographic images, are likely to have randomly dispersed lesions, varied symptoms, and complex backgrounds, making discriminative information difficult to capture. To facilitate plant disease recognition research, we had taken the PlantVillage dataset with 13,347 images with 14 classes. Models were trained using the PlantVillage dataset. The performance of EfficientNet architecture for classifying the plant leaf disease was compared against ResNet-50, Inception V3, AlexNet, and Xception deep learning algorithms in this analysis. The outcomes of the test dataset revealed that B3 models of the EfficientNet architecture had the greatest accuracy of 99.90 percent when related to other deep learning algorithm in the dataset.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Structures and Information Theory']"
doi:10.1007/978-981-19-2145-2_63,en,Critical Study of Wind Effect on RC Structure with Different Permeability,OriginalPaper,"Wind load is one of the significant loads that affect the design of a structure. Therefore, to analyze and design a building considering the effect of wind load, it is necessary to calculate the wind speed and pressure for different heights of buildings with different geometry. In the current building codes and design standards, internal stresses are insufficiently defined, primarily due to the complexities involved in their assessment, but play an important role in the design of buildings and cladding. The category of the building with a single dominant opening is usually considered critical for wind load design. However, the correct assessment of internal pressure behavior for buildings with cross-openings of realistic wall porosities is essential. In this paper, the reinforced concrete framed structure is analyzed for three classes of structure, i.e., Class A, B, and C with the constant base dimension; with varying heights of the structure; having four bays in each direction, and ceiling height of 3 m. All the models are analyzed for three different basic wind speeds, i.e., 33, 44, and 55 m/s with three different permeabilities, i.e., <5, 5–20, and >20% for different terrain categories specified in respective standards. The influence of the wind load response in terms of axial force, bending moment, and peak deflections are calculated and compared. It is observed that the effect of terrain category and permeability is not significant in centrally located columns. However, in corner columns, the axial forces are not constant. It increases with the increase in wind speed, permeability, and reduces from terrain category 1–4. Also, significant co-relation between forces and displacement was observed for less than 5% permeability, wind speed of 33 m/s, and terrain category 1.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Construction Management', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering']"
doi:10.1007/978-981-19-2821-5_15,en,A Review on Community Detection Using Deep Neural Networks with Enhanced Learning,OriginalPaper,"Community detection has become pervasive in understanding complex network structures and detecting similar patterns. The main motivation behind using deep learning methods for community detection comes from the brilliant performance results shown by deep neural networks in various fields. Using unsupervised learning models, the problem of community detection can be solved. The high-dimensional feature space representation of the network data leads to a complex neural network architecture that requires a high number of trainable parameters. Deep learning-based models can transform the high-dimensional graph data of complex networks into simple, low-dimensional space or latent representation. The transformation of network representation to latent representation consists of meaningful features of the network data. This mapping preserves the structural information of the network later on, which clustering algorithms can be applied to the converted latent representation. This survey paper provides an overview of the traditional and deep learning-based methods of community detection, followed by a discussion on the challenges and future directions of community detection.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

A rigorous theoretical proof is presented based on the separation principle. Furthermore, an adaptive controller with a modal variable observer is designed for the case without the measurements of the modal variables.

This is one of the reasons why conventional architectural approaches and technologies are now constantly subjected to series of modifications the most crucial of which is caused by the necessity for decentralized operation. There exists a good portion of algorithms which enable handle this problem. However, only a few of those optimize against multiple objectives, much less enable subjecting a network to coordination. In this paper, we propose an approach that enables setting of multiple objectives for load balancing process in a way so it only requires a coordinating entity to operate with strategic-level terms. Decisions made on this level fuse into local-level decision making performed by individual agents (network nodes), thus enabling separation of responsibilities in terms of scope thus allowing to fit the process of load balancing taking states of the network’s particular parts into consideration.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In particular, we consider the situation where each agent has a dichotomous preference over the items, that is, each agent evaluates each item as acceptable or unacceptable. Furthermore, we assume that communication between agents is limited, and the relationship is represented by an undirected graph. Then, a pair of agents can exchange their items only if they are connected by an edge and the involved items are acceptable. We prove that this problem is $$\textsf{PSPACE}$$ PSPACE -complete even when the communication graph is complete (that is, every pair of agents can exchange their items), and this problem can be solved in polynomial time if an input graph is a tree.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

With appropriate restrictions imposed on their instances, the proposed decision problems parameterized by appropriate size parameters are proven to be equivalent in computational complexity to either the parameterized 3-bounded 2CNF Boolean formula satisfiability problem or the parameterized degree-3 directed s - t connectivity problem by “short” logarithmic-space reductions.

doi:10.1007/978-1-0716-2819-5_16,en,Phased Genome Assemblies,OriginalPaper,"The ultimate goal of de novo assembly of reads sequenced from a diploid individual is the separate reconstruction of the sequences corresponding to the two copies of each chromosome. Unfortunately, the allele linkage information needed to perform phased genome assemblies has been difficult to generate. Hence, most current genome assemblies are a haploid mixture of the two underlying chromosome copies present in the sequenced individual. Sequencing technologies providing long (20 kb) and accurate reads are the basis to generate phased genome assemblies. This chapter provides a brief overview of the main milestones in traditional genome assembly, focusing on the bioinformatic techniques developed to generate haplotype information from different specialized protocols. Using these techniques as a knowledge background, the chapter reviews the current algorithms to generate phased assemblies from long reads with low error rates. Current techniques perform haplotype-aware error correction steps to increase the quality of the raw reads. In addition, variations on the traditional overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) graph have been developed in an effort to eliminate edges between reads sequenced from different chromosome copies. This allows for large presence–absence variants between the chromosome copies to be taken into account. The development of these algorithms, along with the improved sequencing technologies has been crucial to finish chromosome-level assemblies of complex genomes.","['Life Sciences', 'Genetics and Genomics']"

A method based on the total water collection (TWC) was proposed to determine the critical icing parameters such as velocity, altitude, temperature, LWC and MVD. Furthermore, the method was verified in CIRA-IWT by observing the ice shedding at the end of 45 min duration and by the comparison of ice shape calculated by CFD.

Existing works propose reconfiguration solutions that use backup path resources to temporarily move some connections. The final routing is found as you go. In this work, we reconfigure the initial routing to a new precomputed routing. This causes new dependencies in addition to those existing between the shared backup paths, increasing the difficulty of the process. To solve this problem, we use dependency graphs and backup resources.

One of the main is the relatively low modulus of elasticity compared to steel. As a result, elements with FRP reinforcement have a higher deformability. In this regard, the requirements of the service limit states imposed on structures may become the main obstacle to the use of FRP for reinforcing concrete members. Experimental studies were carried out taking into account and observing the provisions of GOST 8829-2018. Concrete beam specimens were 120 × 220 mm in cross section and 1810 mm in length, reinforced with two bars in a tension side. The beams were reinforced longitudinally with steel, glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) and basalt fiber-reinforced polymer (BFRP) bars. The value of the reinforcement ratio varied. Methods for calculating the crack width of guidelines are considered: Russia—Construction rules and regulations 63.13330.2012 and 295.1325800.2017, USA—ACI 440.1R-06. The results of theoretical and experimental studies of the crack resistance of flexural members with FRP reinforcement are obtained. Differences in the considered design methods are revealed. Deviations of theoretical data from experimental data are determined. Inaccurate determination of the cracking moment M crc has a negative impact on the results of calculating the deflection of flexural members with FRP. Features of crack formation in members with FRP reinforcement are recorded, which call into question the possibility of using the design methods by Construction rules and regulations 63.13330.2012 and 295.1325800.2017.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-16075-2_26,en,A Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Using A New Graph Transformer Model for Routing Problems,OriginalPaper,"Routing problems, which belong to a classical kind of problem in combinatorial optimization, have been extensively studied for many decades by researchers from different backgrounds. In recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been applied widely in self-driving, robotics, industrial automation, video games, and other fields, showing its strong decision-making and learning ability. In this paper, we propose a new graph transformer model, based on the DRL algorithm, for minimizing the route lengths of a given routing problem. Specifically, the actor-network parameters are trained by an improved REINFORCE algorithm to effectively reduce the variance and adjust the frequency of the reward values. Further, positional encoding is used in the encoding structure to make the multiple nodes satisfy translation invariance during the embedding process and enhance the stability of the model. The aggregate operation of the graph neural network applies to transformer model decoding stage at this time, which effectively captures the topological structure of the graph and the potential relationships between nodes. We have used our model to two classical routing problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitate Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The experimental results show that the optimization effect of our model on small and medium-sized TSP and CVRP surpasses the state-of-the-art DRL-based methods and some traditional algorithms. Meanwhile, this model also provides an effective strategy for solving combinatorial optimization problems on graphs.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The current scenario reflects progress in a variety of less known regions as a means of extraction for the understanding of prevention and treatment for significant medical diseases such as COVID-19. Recently, many good scientific research publications in the biomedical arena was released using the MEDLINE/PubMed dataset. In the fields of biomedical research and healthcare, assessing these enormous data sets and extracting valuable information is a critical but difficult endeavour. Here, we attempt to retrieve relevant data from openly accessible text materials, like medical reports, journals, articles, papers, and some other research works, in the medical area. hese types of text data undergo first preprocessing in this chapter using sentence tokenization, then stopword removal, stemming operations, and ultimately vectorization using the BioBERT model. Consequently, a structured data is generated to process each report in feature extraction process and then clustered the similar sentences by Fuzzy C-means clustering. Then, using multiple similarity clustering measures and a bi-objective strength measure, defuzzify the clusters and construct the base summaries. To construct the report summary, en ensemble summarising approach has been employed by using Pareto evolutionary algorithm. The method contains two optimization methods(or functions): one dependent on the produced summary size, which is constant, and the other dependent on the IG (i.e., information gain) of the considering base summaries, which is variable. When the process of evolution converges, the strongest chromosomal solution of the ultimate population offers a desired summary report. This approach is used to generate an efficient summary from biomedical reports publically available in the MEDLINE/PubMed dataset, and finally, its performance comparing with a few similar cutting-edge techniques.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Health Informatics']"

It has been widely accepted worldwide for more than five decades and is used in many applications other than military avionics. It follows a strict and deterministic procedure for communication among its components. However, research has suggested that it has many vulnerabilities associated with it that can be exploited to carry a range of attacks on it. And since numerous applications make use of this standard, it is crucial to protect MIL-STD-1553 networks. This chapter presents an unsupervised anomaly detection scheme using the CUSUM algorithm for the MIL-STD-1553 protocol. A dataset was collected in the ISOT lab by executing six attack vectors on a simulated MIL-STD-1553 network. We leverage the time-based properties of the communication bus to extract a set of relevant features that are fed to the CUSUM algorithm for detection. The experimental evaluation of the proposed detector using the dataset yielded promising results, which are very encouraging considering the unsupervised nature of the underlying algorithm.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Automatic text summarization helps to solve the problem by minimizing the document size while keeping its core information. In this study, two extractive single document automatic text summarization systems for Turkish are presented which implement the statistical-based TF-IDF algorithm as well as the combination of TF-IDF with the graph-based PageRank algorithm. The study aims to reveal the usability and effectiveness of these algorithms for Turkish documents. Moreover, the results of the TF-IDF implementation and the hybrid approach are compared using the co-selection measures, precision, recall, and F-score. In the evaluation phase, the system-generated summaries are categorized and tested based on their word sizes and the predetermined thresholds and compared against the human-generated summaries. The results indicate that the hybrid system performs better than the TF-IDF system even in lower thresholds, and also both systems are inclined to improve average F-scores in higher threshold generated summarization.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Malachite green (MG) is one of the dyes used in the dye industry, which is mutagenic, carcinogenic and therefore toxic. Water hyacinth (WH) is an aquatic weed, which is known for its proliferating growth. This leads to the eutrophication of water bodies. Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) powder is used as bio adsorbent to remove malachite green dye from aqueous solution. The adsorptive removal capacity of malachite green using water hyacinth powder was studied by carrying out the batch study on synthetic samples to assess malachite green removal efficiency. The effect on the removal was a function of various parameters like agitation speed, adsorbent dose, contact time, initial concentration, particle size and pH. At pH 7 adsorption reaches equilibrium at an agitation speed of 130 rpm at a contact time of 30 min at temperature of 27 °C. The pseudo-second-order kinetics and both Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms with R 2 0.9987, 0.9970 and 0.9923, respectively, fit the kinetics and isotherm models. The water hyacinth characterization was carried out with SEM and EDX, which suggests adsorption of malachite green. From the results obtained it can be observed that water hyacinth powder can adsorb the malachite green dye under optimum conditions which are easy to maintain. Therefore, water hyacinth can be potentially applied for the removal of malachite green dye from dye wastewater.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Construction Management', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering']"

The smart grid technology can help to store a large amount of data and provide basic data analysis but it cannot give a systematic representation method. While digging internal connections and knowledge, the smart grid technology seems helpless so it cannot provide auxiliary decision for the implementation of smart grid to achieve true ‘intelligence’. To solve this problem, we propose the pre-training models based knowledge graph multi-hop reasoning model which based on the knowledge graph of distribution network defects under smart grid technology. The model divides into two parts: the pre-training model and the multi-hop reasoning model. The former part is natural language pre-training model for extracting the entities related to the problem to be solved from the knowledge graph, and extracting the knowledge subgraph formed by these entities in the original knowledge graph. The later part is the neural network model which uses the knowledge subgraph extracted from the natural language pre-training model for relational reasoning to form the solution path of the problem and obtain the strongly correlated entities of the solved problem. To verify the model’s performance, we train four kinds of multi-hop reasoning models and test them in different-hop questions for transformer defect analysis of smart grid. Experimental results show that the proposed model can guarantee high accuracy under different reasoning difficulties which can effectively promote the auxiliary decision-making of smart grid.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Multiagent Systems', 'Systems Theory, Control']"

The links are connected through revolute joints which are actuated using a mechanism consisting of a motor, lead-screw, slider-nut, and string-tubes. A bond graph model for the dynamics of the manipulator has been developed. For the trajectory control, the tip of the manipulator is dragged along the desired trajectory and corresponding joint angles are determined from the bond graph model. These joint angles provide the commanding inputs to the PD controller. Based on the error between the commanded and the actual joint angles of the manipulator, the PD controllers give a control signal to the motor drives which will, in turn, apply the necessary control torques at the joints of the manipulator. For the force control, the motion of an infinitesimal mass, corresponding to the desired force, is used as the input trajectory to the tip of the manipulator. Joint angles determined from the model corresponding to this input will give the required torques at the joints of the manipulator through the PD controllers and the actuation mechanism. The proposed technique for the trajectory and force control techniques using bond graph avoids inverse kinematics.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Mechatronics', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Energy Storage', 'Materials Engineering']"

By constructing two different kinds of auxiliary Euler-Lagrange systems, passivity-based controllers are designed under undirected or directed communication graphs to achieve the distributed attitude tracking and vibration suppression simultaneously. For the leader-follower consensus under directed graphs, only the controller’s generalized coordinates and the spacecraft attitudes are exchanged among the followers with the help of an extended state observer. The Lyapunov theory is adopted for the stability analysis of the overall system. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics']"

The signals that we will discuss in this chapter are deterministic signals, and they do not have random characteristics. The calculation of power expressions of random signals is beyond the scope of this book. Knowing the energy and power of a signal is an important issue in communication. In particular, many performance criteria are based on the signal power-to-noise power ratio at the receiver. Energy is the total power dissipated by a signal in a given time interval. The power of a signal can be considered as the amount of energy dissipated per unit of time. We can perceive and measure energy as heat and light as it transforms from one form to another. For some signals, the power calculations can be performed, but their energies cannot be calculated, whereas for some other signals, the energies can be calculated, but powers cannot be calculated. In the following sections, we will give examples of these signals and group these signals under different names. Energy and power calculations can be done both in the time domain and in the frequency domain. For some signals, energy calculations can be difficult in the time domain, whereas energy or power calculations in the frequency domain can be made more easily. In this section, we will calculate energy and power only in the time domain. We will consider energy and power calculations in the frequency domain after we study the Fourier transform topic.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Coding and Information Theory', 'Algorithms']"

These parameters influence the characteristics of the resulting system, such as power, speed, and cost. Evaluating the impact of these parameters is however challenging. To estimate the reduction in impedance if, for example, additional BGA balls are dedicated to the power delivery system, adjustments to the board layout and an additional impedance extraction process are required. These processes are poorly automated, requiring significant time and labor. Automating both power network exploration and prototyping can greatly enhance the board-level power delivery design process by increasing the number of possible design options. With power network exploration and prototyping, the effects of the system parameters on the electrical characteristics can be better understood, providing valuable insight into early stages of the design process.

This tool includes the first fully automated algorithm for board-level power network layout synthesis. Two board-level industrial power networks are synthesized using SPROUT.

The artificial weathering of all the prepared specimens was carried out in a machine from 100 to 400 h in order to decide the approximate durability of the laminated samples. The prepared unexposed and exposed laminates were subjected to various mechanical and physicochemical characterizations such as tensile testing, cut slit tearing testing, t-peel testing, helium gas permeability testing, and UV protection factor testing. It has been investigated that the helium gas permeability of based para-aramid laminate (K5 laminate) was 0.04 L/m 2 /day which is extremely low and there was no significant change in tensile properties from fabric to laminate, even after 400 h of UV exposure. The tearing strength of laminates was significantly enhanced than that of fabric due to the greater flexibility of PU adhesive. Therefore, using this type of multilayered laminated fabric would be the potential, effective and new alternative for the envelope of high-altitude airship applications.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engineering Design', 'Building Materials']"

Such information is often recorded only within the huge amounts of unstructured textual documentation that are typically generated for large-scale construction projects. Accordingly, the process of locating, understanding, analysing and combining sufficient intelligence from documentation about previous projects can be overwhelming. Previously, text mining (TM) technology has been used to develop a semantically-enhanced search system over a repository of workplace accident reports, to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of locating important information relating to construction safety. In this article, we describe our enhancement of this system, through the generation and integration of a knowledge graph (KG). We extract triples consisting of subject, predicate and object (SPO) from unstructured text and map them to concepts in a knowledge base (KB). The mapping is carried out by comparing the contextualised representations of the text surrounding the SPO elements with concept descriptions in the KB. Subsequently, a Coreference Resolution method is used to detect mentions in text that refer to the same pronominal references that occur in SPO triples, to ensure that relevant knowledge is not overlooked. Finally, SPO triples are filtered to retain only those containing knowledge that is relevant to construction safety. We show that our approach can significantly outperform related methods, both in terms of detecting the elements of triples and linking them to entries in a KB.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The elements are based on the SL Block system developed by Shen-Guan Shih. The work proposes strategies to assemble multiple SL blocks to form larger aggregations which subsequently turn into building elements on another scale. This approach allows reconsidering the resolution of architectural constructions. Building elements that have previously been considered as solid and monolithic can now be aggregated by many small SL-Blocks. Those dry-joint aggregations allow for easy disassembly and reassembly into different configurations and therefore contribute to a circular reuse of building elements. In order to facilitate such a permanent transformation, the research also includes first steps towards the autonomous assembly of building blocks through a robot including the planning for how to optimally place the parts, as well as ensuring feasible execution by the robot. The goal is a fully autonomous pipeline that takes as input a user-defined, desired shape, and the available building blocks, and directly maps to actions that are executable by the robot. As a result, the desired shape should be optimally resembled through the robot’s autonomous actions. The research therefore addresses handling the combinatorial search space regarding the possibilities to combine the available parts, incorporate the constraints of the robot, creating a feasible plan that ensures the stability of the structure at any point in the construction process, avoiding collisions between the robot and the structure, and in the case of SL-Blocks, trying to ensure that the overall structure is interlocking.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Statistics, general']"

Unlike the traditional magnetorquers used in space, we adopted the electropermanent magnet as a source to generate torque. We focused on the fact that an electropermanent magnet doesn’t consume any continuous electric power supply to hold its magnetic property once it is magnetized. From this point of view, it is worthwhile to investigate further the characteristics of the electropermanent magnet and aim to replace the electromagnets in the magnetorquer. Furthermore, based on the current findings, we presume that this new type of magnetorquer has relatively low energy consumption while performing attitude control maneuvers, especially for detumbling and stabilizing a satellite. To proceed with the application, we developed a preliminary experimental setup and have identified some of the properties of the electropermanent magnet. We have discovered that it can switch on and off and alter the magnetic dipole moment, including its direction. Thus, in other words, we can say that it is programmable. At this stage, this property seems to be related to two aspects, the number of electric current pulses and the supply voltage driven to the winding wire, which is closely associated with the external magnetic field. These two parameters are correlated to each other, and both affect the magnetic strength and the transient profile in a different manner. Therefore, in this presentation, we aim to show the latest progress of our experiment regarding the characterization of the electropermanent magnet.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

The numerical analysis is performed using the finite volume approach. The investigation is carried out in a two-dimensional framework. The non-uniform heating is implemented on the left wall considering parabolic, linearly increasing, and linearly decreasing profiles while the total power is kept constant. The right wall is maintained isothermally cold. Other walls of the enclosure are maintained adiabatic. The numerical simulation is carried out for the fixed value of the Rayleigh number and nanoparticle volume fraction. The details of the flow and heat transfer are studied using the streamlines and isotherms. The irreversibility due to the flow and heat transfer is studied using the contours of the entropy generation rate due to the thermal conduction and viscous dissipation. The results show that for all the cases investigated, the linearly increasing heating profile is most undesirable as the rate of entropy generation is maximum. On the other hand, the parabolic profile shows a minimum entropy generation and is suggested as a better heating profile.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering']"
doi:10.1007/978-981-19-6883-9_9,en,Multiscale Prediction of Elastic Modulus of Cementitious Materials,OriginalPaper,"This chapter discusses the existing multiscale models to predict the elastic modulus of cementitious materials across scales by the micromechanics-based homogenization method, including the Mori–Tanaka method, the self-consistent method, the generalized self-consistent method, and the differential method. To predict the elastic properties, the cementitious materials are usually divided into 3 to 5 scales, and the volume fraction of different phases at different scales can be determined from both the experimental and the theoretical methods. Since the interactions between different phases are not the same among the different homogenization methods, the predicted results may vary accordingly. The imperfect interface is an important factor that affects the accuracy of the multiscale prediction of the elastic property of cementitious materials. However, limited research has been conducted to investigate the actual mechanical properties and thickness of the imperfect interface between different phases in cementitious materials, which deserve systematic research in the future.","['Chemistry', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general', 'Materials Science, general', 'Characterization and Evaluation of Materials', 'Building Materials']"

Surface flashover related to the existence of surface charge often occurs on the spacer, which is a great threat to the application of HVDC GIS and the safety of entire grid. Moreover, the influence on surface charge dynamic behavior under pulse voltage produced by switch overvoltage, accompanying with the DC voltage, is still unclear. In order to research the comprehensive effect of DC and pulse voltage on surface charge behavior, in this chapter, epoxy resin sample was charged by a corona discharge system and the charge distribution was measured by an electrostatic voltmeter. The results are obtained from the research of different pulse amplitudes and pulse polarities. When DC and pulse voltage with the same polarity are applied, smaller pulse voltage would push the original charges away, resulting in the decrease of initial surface potential. But a big pulse voltage could increase the surface potential. The speed of surface charge dissipation has an opposite tendency. When the pulse polarity becomes the opposite of DC voltage, surface potential at the sample center will be a heteropolar value at the beginning and then it gradually becomes consistent with the initial polarity. In addition, the surface charge change rate will rise with the increase of heteropolar pulse voltage. The Trap energy distributions were used to analyze charge decay process in the last section.","['Energy', 'Energy Systems', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation']"

A magnetic stirrer was used to disperse TiO 2 nanopowder into POE lubricant for 30 min. The six samples were then subjected to various ultrasonication treatments lasting 40-, 60-, 80-, 100-, and 120-min. Stability analysis was performed in three stages: visual observation, Ultra Violet (UV) visible spectrophotometric analysis, and measurement of the absolute zeta potential. The results showed that sample without ultrasonication treatment had substantial agglomeration as compared to other samples. The absorbance ratio of the sample without ultrasonication treatment is 0.33. The absorbance ratio value escalated as the duration of the ultrasonication treatment on the sample increases. After ultrasonication treatment for 40–120 min, the absorbance ratio increased by 34–117%. The samples treated with 120 min of ultrasonication showed the highest level of stability, as evidenced by the high absorbance ratio and zeta potential values of 0.95 and −80.48 mV, respectively.

Recently, a large number of load scheduling algorithms were developed by various experts, however these methods were not providing accurate results because of their high complexity and utilization of static datasets. To overcome these issues, an improved load scheduling method is proposed in this paper, in which loads are optimized by using the meta-heuristic Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm.

It is well known that sensor scheduling is an important mechanism that helps densely deployed wireless sensor networks save energy. On the other hand, geographic forwarding is an efficient scheme for wireless sensor networks as it requires maintaining only local topology information to forward data to their destination. Most of geographic forwarding protocols assume that all sensors are always on (or active) during forwarding. However, such an assumption is unrealistic for real-world applications where sensors are switched on or off (or inactive). This chapter describes our cover-sense-inform framework for connected k - covered wireless sensor networks, where k- coverage, sensor scheduling, and geographic forwarding are jointly considered. Based on our work on connected k- coverage, which is discussed earlier in Chap. 5 , we propose the first design of geographic forwarding protocols for duty-cycled k -covered wireless sensor networks with and without data aggregation. For the case of planar wireless sensor networks, this chapter discusses a few protocols that exploit the geometry of the configurations, which result from our connected k -coverage protocols, and the concept of virtual potential fields. For the case of spatial wireless sensor networks, it discusses our composite geographic forwarding protocol, which uses a combination of deterministic and opportunistic schemes to forward sensed data towards the sink. Moreover, it shows various simulation results of the proposed geographic forwarding protocols and compares them against others.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks']"

Basically, application of bamboo sheet plate in stone column helps to decrease the lateral displacement of the soft clayey soil. Accordingly, bulging of stone column decreases and enhances the load bearing capacity of the soft clayey soil. A series of model experiments are conducted on a specially fabricated steel tank filled with soft clayey soil in the laboratory. Single stone columns are constructed in the soft soil by digging hole and then placing and compacting stones. Bamboo sheet plates are placed at different locations of the stone column in a single layer such as L /3, L /2, and 2 L /3 from the top, where L stands for the depth or length of stone column. One experiment is performed only for stone column without the bamboo sheet. Another experiment is conducted by placing two bamboo sheet plates together; one at the depth of L /3 and another is at the depth of 2 L /3. A plate load test is also performed to find out the capacity of soft clayey soil. Load verses settlement graphs are plotted for all the tests, and load carrying capacity and settlement are calculated. A comparative study is conducted from the results of different experiments and noticed that load bearing capacity of the soft clayey soil improves by the application of bamboo sheet plate.","['Engineering', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Building Materials', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences']"

However, in some complicated damage scenarios, the damage detection results are not accurate. This study presents an improved two-stage approach based on the Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) and MSE method to boost the efficiency of MSE. Firstly, a new damage indicator named Modal Strain Energy Damage Index (MSEDI), based on MAC, is developed to locate potential damage elements more accurately in the first stage. Then, the damaged zones in plate structures are determined in both locations and extents in the second stage by minimizing an objective function using a genetic algorithm (GA) algorithm. Two different objective functions, global MSE, and local MSE are considered to examine their efficiencies on the performance of the GA algorithm. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed approach is investigated by numerical examples on a plate comprising multiple damage scenarios and different boundary conditions. The obtained results indicate that even in highly complex damage scenarios, the proposed improvement can identify the actual damage sites and estimate the extent of damage with high precision. The numerical results also show that the computational cost of the optimization process using the objective function based on local MSE change is much lower than that using the objective function based on global MSE change.","['Energy', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Structural Materials', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Construction Management', 'Environmental Policy']"

This paper aims to study the effects of the HPC interstage bleed, power off-take and IPC bleed air fraction on the transient performance of a three-shaft turbofan engine for entry into service (EIS) 2050. The influences of the bleeding air fraction with 1, 3 and 5% on the critical components, net thrust and SFC were investigated. Afterwards, the interstage bleed was set at the HPC inlet, 2nd, 3rd, 4th stage of the HPC to seek the optimum bleed strategy. Then power extraction was designated as 50 kW, 100 kW, 150 kW respectively to study the transient performance variation. Moreover, the corresponding temperature overshooting exerted on the turbine blade life was predicted. Finally, an 8100 nm of flight mission evaluation in terms of block fuel, NOx, CO 2 and H 2 O was conducted to explore the above factor impact. The findings showed that increasing IPC bleeding air boosts the Fan and IPC surge margin. The interstage bleed position and IPC bleed air fraction were influential in mission performance. The HPC interstage bleed position at the 4th stage would lead to around 1.70%, 1.95%, 1.45% and 1.65% increase in block fuel, NOx, CO 2 and H 2 O compared to the 2nd stage.

Vienna rectifier consists of three switches and four diodes with an input inductor and performs both AC/DC and DC/DC conversions in a single stage. A permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) coupled with wind turbine system is used in this paper. The tracking of the maximum power is a real challenge in wind energy systems. In this paper, the variable speed of the wind turbine generator system and the power output of the permanent magnet synchronous generator are chosen as inputs to the fuzzy logic controller to track the maximum power according to the change in wind speed by following 27 set of rules formulated in the fuzzy rule base. The pulse width modulated signals from the fuzzy logic controller initiate the three switches in the Vienna rectifier. The proposed control scheme not only tracks the maximum power from the wind but also enhances the input DC voltage, ensures sinusoidal nature at input mains and balances the voltage across the two capacitors. The Vienna rectifier is interfaced to the grid through space vector pulse width modulated voltage source inverter.

For a long time, achieving zero downtime has been the utmost goal of industry practitioners and manufacturers. Due to the lack of automation and real-time monitoring, industrial manufacturers often find it difficult to remotely track machine health and manufacturing process, affecting production output. Although technology in I4.0, namely, the Internet of Things (IoT), helped in monitoring machine health with sensors, several challenges related to IoT in maintenance parameters monitoring restrict the proper utilization of technology. Thus, this paper attempted to study IoT challenges in maintenance parameters monitoring using a Graph Theory (GT) approach. 24 IoT challenges are identified and grouped into four dimensions: connectivity, data management, scalability and flexibility, and security. Diagraphs were constructed for the entire system and sub-system showing the interrelationship between several dimensions and challenges to explain the influence of IoT challenges in the maintenance of machines through an indicator calculated from permanent value.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Machinery and Machine Elements']"

Several severe damages could be generated, such as fouling, erosion, corrosion, rubbing wear, hot end component damage. All these cumulative effects would cause deterioration and the engine might not satisfy the design requirements. This paper aims to investigate the influences of component degradation regarding efficiency and flow capacity on the engine performance, transient behaviour and aircraft level performance. 1%, 3% and 5% degradation of each component is studied separately to obtain the resultant engine deterioration. Considering the engine deterioration is always caused by the combination of efficiency and flow capacity, several cases with superimposed factors are simulated in the flight mission analysis. The outcomes indicate that LPT and HPC efficiency degradation exerts an obvious effect on engine performance. A 5% decrease in LPT and HPC efficiency would result in a 4.74% increase in SFC and a 4.27% rise in T4 separately at the takeoff point. More importantly, the operating lines of Fan and IPC are pushed towards the surge line during a slam operation to take-off condition. The combination of efficiency and mass flow degradation of 5% for each component demonstrates a noticeable 5.8% rise in block fuel. Furthermore, the corresponding NOx and CO 2 are unavoidably increased by 15.3%, 5.8% and 5.8% respectively. It could be concluded that component degradation should be closely observed to prevent catastrophic consequences.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

On the contrary, in this work a completely unsupervised method is proposed, inspired by a previous 2D approach to segmentation, reformulated and extended to the case of 3D tomographic images. The method uses a flooding algorithm for the extraction of regions in the lung area, followed by the association with the corresponding statistical model by parametric estimation. A maximum a posteriori estimate of the 3D label map is obtained by modeling the image as a Markov Random Field that includes space-contextual information by means of a simple local proximity model for inter-voxel dependence. At this level, the problem is reformulated in terms of energy minimization, which is addressed using the α - β swap graph-cut algorithm. The proposed method was tested on 3D lung images in order to delineate infections from CT scans of the chest. A set of COVID-19 confirmed patients was then considered, and the results obtained showed accurate detection ability and remarkable robustness to the heterogeneity of CT scans considered.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Machine Learning', 'Robotics and Automation']"

The relationship can be determined by frequency of interactions, propagation, and cultural activities and strong/week ties in social network. The structure of social network characterizes in terms of nodes (individual actors, people, or a thing within the network), ties, edges and links. The node is to be optimized to improve the link availability, clique through rate, effectiveness of link usage. The node optimization could be achieved by optimization of links. There are many predicting techniques are used to predict the nodes decision to improve the ‘influence propagation’ and ‘retrieve information’ from the requested users. The existing link prediction algorithms are based by the performance of the community’s with multiple parameters in the social network environment, and each parameter has to be quantified for best trade among the links. Hence, a node proximity clustering (NPC) algorithm has considered multi-dimensional parameters along with node weight value to quantify the importance value of the link prediction. The performance of the designed algorithm has been experimented in the various scenarios. The node proximity clustering algorithm (NPC) has been experimented in the defined environment with the fast greedy (FG), binomial (B), and socio rank (SR) of prediction algorithms.

To alleviate this problem and ease the creation of new products, the consolidation of such variants into a Software Product Line (SPL) is an effective solution. For this, a fundamental step is to construct a variability model that represents the combinations of features of all the existing variants. However, the process of extracting an SPL from independent variants, and consequently constructing a variability model, is acknowledged as costly and error-prone. Instead of starting from scratch, many approaches have been proposed for reverse engineering variability models, but they have two limitations. These approaches usually optimize a single objective that does not allow software engineers to consider design trade-offs and do not exploit knowledge from implementation artifacts. This chapter presents our approach to address these limitations. Our approach applies a multi-objective optimization strategy and uses source code dependencies to reverse engineer variability models. The resulting model not only represents the desired feature combinations but are also well-formed regarding source code dependencies, i.e., variability safe. The approach, using two multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, namely NSGA-II and SPEA2, and a single-objective algorithm was evaluated with twelve subject systems. For comparisons, we rely on widely adopted performance indicators. The results indicate that the performance of the multi-objective algorithms is similar in most cases, and that both clearly outperform the single-objective algorithm. Also, the trade-off among different solutions is important to support engineers during decision making.","['Computer Science', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Software Management', 'Computer System Implementation']"

Recent experimental studies explore the ability of these rubber pads to reduce ballast layer stress, ballast degradation, and excessive track settlement through large-scale laboratory investigations. Numerical simulation of these large-scale experiments provides an efficient and cost-effective approach to extend for more investigations. Finite element method (FEM) and discrete element method (DEM) are the main approaches used in many studies to simulate the ballasted rail track behaviour. The selection of an appropriate numerical approach mainly depends on the nature of the materials, simulation type, computational cost, and the expected level of accuracy. However, limited numerical studies have been done so far to simulate the static and cyclic loading behaviour of energy-absorbing rubber pads as a solid element for railway applications using either FEM or DEM approaches. Therefore, in this study, 3D models of a rubber pad were developed using both FEM and DEM approaches and they were validated based on the experimental data from the literature for the quasi-static loading condition. Then, a parametric study was carried out by changing the thickness of the rubber pad using both numerical approaches and the results were compared. The results exhibited that the developed numerical models captured the behaviour of the rubber pad with reasonable accuracy for both FEM and DEM approaches. Therefore, the developed rubber pad models can be effectively used in numerical simulations of large-scale experiments and railway applications using either FEM or DEM approaches based on the requirement.","['Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Sustainable Development', 'Building Materials', 'Building Construction and Design']"

Regression is one of the essential techniques of predictive analytics in which a lot of prediction problems are modeled. Regression is a kind of supervised learning algorithms since a regression model requires both the dependent as well as the independent variables in the data set. Four simple linear regression models are developed, and two of them are best fitted. The fitted models are logarithmic-linear. The model’s output is to find the number of fatalities based on the total number of accidents. The special cases considered here are accidents on a T-junction and accidents due to the intake of alcohol.

The efficacy of the proposed method is validated by simulating 5-, 13-, and 25-level output voltages with a total harmonic distortion of 17.6%, 6.40%, and 3.26%, respectively in MATLAB/Simulink.","['Engineering', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Energy Systems']"

To address this, a solar test cell was constructed and placed on the roof of the Albert A Thornborough building at the University of Guelph from June to August 2021. The test cell was built to allow controlled investigation of thermal properties of a simplified version of a greenhouse, with fewer unknown values and relationships. The experimental set-up included 6 mil polyethylene glazing above a 10 cm deep air layer, above 5 cm of sand. The structure was framed with dimensional lumber and particle board and included 2.5 cm of foam board insulation on side walls and below the sand layer to mitigate heat loss. Interior and exterior temperature and relative humidities, as well as wind speed and solar irradiance were recorded over the duration of the experiment. Heat transfer in the cell was simulated with a modified one-dimensional lumped capacitance model that tracked heat fluxes between discrete layers. Identifying the optimal parameters for this test cell allow for relevant findings to be transferred to more complex greenhouse models. Two multivariable sensitivity analyses were conducted on parameters and relationships used in the model, with the optimized configuration resulting in root mean squared errors for air temperature that were less than 5 °C, with a daily air temperature range of over 70 °C. Also included is a methodology for finding the thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of the soil using measured temperatures.","['Energy', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Environmental and Sustainability Education', 'Sustainable Development', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Natural Resource and Energy Economics']"

Anchor systems have recently been used successfully in structures that have been subjected to uplift force. These anchor systems are affected by soil properties, loading conditions, embedment ratio and anchor group configuration. Model tests in the laboratory were used to investigate the uplift behaviour of plate anchors embedded in cohesion-less soil media with and without geosynthetic. Many factors, including the type of geosynthetic, the area of the anchor plate, relative density, the depth of embedment, the type of soil and the area of geosynthetic inclusion, have significantly influenced plate anchor uplift behaviour. The present paper describes the methodology and experimentation on model horizontal plate anchors embedded in geosynthetic reinforced cohesion-less soil beds. Also, the analytical investigation was carried out and the results were compared. It is observed those plate anchors embedded in reinforced soil exhibit 1.4 times more uplift capacity than the anchors embedded in unreinforced soil. Inclusion of geosynthetic layer increases the effective area of anchorage.","['Engineering', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Environment, general']"

First phase of the present research has been focused on the behaviour of reinforced concrete beams wrapped with carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates. Nonlinear finite element approach has been followed to develop numerical models. The deflection, stresses, cracking and yielding damage are recorded for beam models with and without the CFRP laminates. It has been concluded that not only the presence of FRP laminates but also its location and area covered by it under different types of loading play an important role in guiding the overall structural behaviour of the RC beam strengthened with FRP. This kind of study requires a lot of computational time, expensive software packages, including technical personnel conversant with it. As an alternative approach, in the second phase, an ANN-based predictive model developed in MATLAB and Python has been suggested, using the data obtained from the first phase of the study, to predict the structural behaviour of RC beams strengthened with FRP laminates using different parameters as input. It has been noted that the difference between the results obtained from the finite element software and the ANN model is negligible.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Building Materials', 'Structural Materials']"

For mass production of hydrogen, linear focusing systems consisting of parabolic trough mirrors are suitable because of the high scalability of the power plant capacity. Although most of the conventional linear focusing systems have been operated under 400 °C, higher temperatures are desirable for more efficient solar-thermal energy conversion and hence for lower cost of hydrogen production. A key component in the linear focusing systems is solar receiver tubes with “solar selective absorbers” by which concentrated solar radiation is absorbed and thermal infrared radiation is inhibited at the operating high temperatures. This chapter introduces novel solar selective absorbers for efficient and durable solar-thermal energy conversion operating at 650 °C. The solar absorptance has been enhanced by band-edge absorption of semiconducting β -FeSi 2 , and the infrared emissivity at high temperatures has been reduced by thermally stabilized silver (Ag). The optimally designed multilayers achieved the averaged solar-thermal conversion efficiency of 87% between 300 and 650 °C, and ensured superior thermal durability over 25 years under high temperatures.","['Chemistry', 'Green Chemistry', 'Energy Storage', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering', 'Energy Materials', 'Energy Systems', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management']"

Fuel is a non-renewable resource. Cost of petrol is sky-scraping in India. Global pollution is also high. To reduce the crisis, auto manufacturers concentrate on the development of the fuel economy of the vehicle. To increase the fuel economy, we reduce the wastage of fuel consumption in any scenario. So, fuel consumption is controlled by different variables. This article mainly focuses on the fuel economy of two-wheeler by optimizing the influenced factors such as load, speed, octane number, and tire pressure. By changing the various levels, the experiment was carried out to calculate fuel mileage by using an average mileage testing bottle. The experimental data have been analyzed by using Taguchi, ANOVA method and regression analysis to provide favorable solution. This paper’s, main objective is to find out high influencing factors by applying design of experiments and also suggest the best combination of control factors to give better fuel economy for two-wheelers. From this paper it was found that control variable such as the speed and octane number is the high influencing parameter for fuel consumption.

In both of them, a large amount of non-plastic fines was involved in fine sands that presumably destined the sand highly contractive and flowable on the contractive side of SSL. This particular sand has been tested in undrained triaxial tests, demonstrating that the sand of original grading ( F c  ≈ 35%) is far more contractive with strain-softening behavior in the post-peak stage and easier to flow than the sand deprived of fines in the same relative density. This strongly suggests that the high content of non-plastic fines is the major cause of the flow failure observed in Hokkaido. A series of torsional simple shear undrained cyclic tests on contractive sands with fines were addressed to examine liquefaction behavior under different initial shear stresses indicating that the flow failure was confirmed to initiate even in a low gradient slope when the effective stress path comes across a straight line from the origin on the $$\tau \sim \sigma_c^{\prime}$$ diagram uniquely defined irrespective of stress paths.","['Engineering', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Building Materials']"
doi:10.1007/978-981-19-2689-1_44,en,Numerical Study of the Aerodynamic Performance of Two Coaxial Flapping Rotary Wings Under Wake Interaction,OriginalPaper,"Flapping rotary wing (FRW) is a composite flapping wing layout proposed in the last decade for micro air vehicle (MAV) design. FRW flaps actively in the vertical direction coupled with passive horizontal rotation, ensuring that the high-lift mechanisms from wing flapping at low Reynolds numbers and the high aerodynamic efficiency of the rotary wing are applied in this wing layout. In actual MAV designs, multiple FRWs have various arrangements, one of which is the arrangement where FRWs locate coaxially and rotate in the same direction. In this type of arrangement, a complex flow interaction exists between wakes from the upper and lower wings, but it has never been focused on in previous research. Thus, this study investigates the effect of wake interaction on the aerodynamics of two coaxial FRWs by using the lattice Boltzmann method and explores the influence of rotation speed, flapping phase difference ( $$\Delta \theta$$ Δ θ ), and wing vertical distance between two wings on the lift and rotating moment, which determine the rotation speed of actual FRW. With inverse flapping (i.e., $$\Delta \theta =\pi$$ Δ θ = π ), the wings interact strongly, and the MAV can reach the maximum rotating moment. An increase in vertical distance between the two wings and rotation speed can weaken the interaction. Our design allows for high rotating speed and low wing loads, thereby reducing the torque requirements on the motor. This study can enhance our understanding of the complex wake interaction produced by multiple FRWs at low Reynolds numbers and provide theoretical guidance for the design of MAVs, especially FRW MAVs.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

The World Health Organization (WHO) tracks and classifies variants as variants of concern (VOCs) or variants of interest (VOIs), depending on the level of transmissibility and dominance of the variant in the regions. The classification and identification of variants usually occur through sequence alignment techniques, which are computationally complex, making them unfeasible to classify thousands of sequences simultaneously. In this work, an application of the alignment-free method BASiNETEntropy is proposed for the classification of the variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2. The method initially maps the biological sequences as a complex network. From this, the most informative edges are selected through the entropy maximization principle, getting a filtered network containing only the most informative edges. Thus, complex network topological measurements are extracted and used as features vectors in the classification process. Sequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern extracted from NCBI were used to assess the method. Experimental results show that extracted features can classify the variants of concern with high assertiveness, considering few features, contributing to the reduction of the feature space. Besides classifying the variants of concern, unique patterns (motifs) were also extracted for each variant, relative to the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence.

The earthquake caused substantial damage to the built environment in Sikkim. The ground motions from the damaging earthquake were recorded at six stations in Sikkim. A detailed analysis of the key characteristics of these strong ground motions can enable a better understanding of the enormous structural damage. While it is recognized that the amplitude and frequency content of seismic waves are the two key characteristics that can be correlated with observed structural damage, it is often the sequence of arrival of frequency and amplitude, which affects the response of the structure. This sequencing is understood from continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) which can, at any given instant of time, convey information on both the time and frequency characteristics of the seismic wave. In this paper, published reconnaissance studies are examined to tabulate significant details of the observed structural damage from six towns affected by the 2011 Sikkim earthquake. These damage observations are then correlated with the CWT representations of the seismic waves corresponding to these towns.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Building Materials', 'Structural Materials']"

Although the MPC method can predict future states and reflect them it the present state optimally, in real-world scenarios, its computational load increases exponentially with the number of state variables and the length of the time window. To reduce the computational burden and obtain the predicted optimal control input by using the MPC technique, herein, we devise an approach involving neural networks. To evaluate the weighting parameters of the neural networks, a considerable volume of learning data is required, which can be generated by conducting numerical simulations. Herein, we generate the input and output data pairs for a given time window by using the MPC method and by means of simulations. This learning process is expected to mitigate the computational burden dramatically. Lastly, one of the drawbacks of MPC is that the model for evaluating the optimal control input for a given time interval must be extremely accurate to guarantee system stability. Therefore, to increase the robustness of the MPC method against external disturbances and internal uncertainties, we augment it by using the Sliding Mode Control (SMC) method. The effectiveness of the suggested neural-network-based Model Predictive Sliding Mode Control method is demonstrated by means of numerical simulations.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

The idea is to use combinatorial optimization based on spectral graph theory to generate data from a qualitative non-stochastic causal model and reconstruct the adjacency matrix using this data. The basis of the proposed IMRA method is the solution of the optimization problem of obtaining the transfer matrix as a reconstructed adjacency matrix of the original graph model with a specific type of constraint for the quadratic forms of the transfer matrix elements. Restoring (reconstructing) the adjacency matrix of the original graph model implement an effective ratio between the impact vector and the response vector in the model under study. The IMRA method restores the adjacency matrix of a signed directed weighted graph from given parameters in a generalized formulation. The method allows one to formalize the dependence of the influence of network characteristics on the properties of the network, making it possible to design networks with specified properties.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Furthermore, it is possible to obtain statistics that goes beyond human observation. They enhance and speed up data collection; perform commands automatically or remotely; and perform remote tasks and actions in real time. Agriculture lives in a digital age, of big data and of the IoT (Internet of Things). The technical management of weeds in row crops is carried out by applying herbicides mechanically or manually. Mechanical systems are generally effective in eliminating weeds at certain stages of growth. But different types of weeds restrict the performance of mechanical system. As a consequence, labor is required to remove weeds in close proximity to the plants, which can be more expensive than the mechanical procedure and not completely effective and results in large amount of pesticide usage which brings down the quality of crops. This paper presents the hybrid effective normalized vegetation index (NDVI) and YOLOV5 structure for multiclass classification of weeds.

However, making cement in industries will result in rising carbon dioxide levels in the environment. OPC particles can be partially replaced by silica fumes to provide a sustainable alternative while improving the performance of concrete mixtures. Silica fume is a commercial by-product that is chemically non-metallic and non-hazardous. The goal of this study is to produce concrete mixed with optimum silica percentage with a consistent water–binder ratio. Different physical qualities of traditional components necessary for mix design are examined in this paper in laboratory-controlled circumstances to meet the aims. In order to reveal the best replacement proportion for up to 90-day compressive strength values, various destructive and non-destructive mechanical testings were carried out on different mixes. For silica admixed concrete (SAC) mixes, the optimum values were found near to 15% replacement levels. However, replacing more cement with silica in a 1:1 weight ratio reduces the strength. When matched to destructive testing results, non-destructive testing yields comparable values for SAC composites.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Building Materials', 'Structural Materials']"

They allow the description of the transformation rules that link the different metamodels concepts. However, significant efforts are needed to describe and maintain model transformations in an ever-changing digital environment. One of the key challenges of the MDA approach is the automation of model transformations. Recent work exploiting machine learning techniques to infer model transformations has shown very promising results. However, learning algorithms, involve too much training data and require a large and varied dataset.

Taken literally, the tomorrow is a slight exaggeration but without water a human will not survive more than a few days and in the case of no food, a few weeks. In the pre-agricultural period of human history, the hunters-gathers foraged and hunted for water and food and, if unsuccessful, their chances of survival were severely, maybe even fatally, compromised. Humans also breath oxygenated air; about 20,000 or more times a day and the majority can only survive a very few minutes without it. However, even with sufficient air, water, and food in the absence of some form of shelter to protect against the vagaries of weather, animal predators, including other humans, survival was very difficult. Today, the same dismal situations occur when humans do not have access to clean drinking water, clean air, sufficient food, and adequate housing. These challenges have been exacerbated since the nineteenth century as global populations rapidly increase, a trend likely to continue to at least the end of the twenty-first century. Globally the world produces more food than it consumes, the amount of water has remained a constant since humans first appeared, anthropogenic activities continue to adversely effect air quality, and the housing supply is not keeping up with demand. Despite the global food and water situations there are still people without secure access to food or clean drinking water, which exacerbates the housing problems. Are these issues simply the ramifications of overwhelming population rise? Can they be solved? In a recent global survey, the respondents expected that as the world population increases engineers can resolve the water, food, and housing scarcities, although they also believe that engineering’s first priority is to solve these problems by 2035, as well as improving renewable energy and healthcare. These are challenging tasks long familiar to engineers, especially since political, cultural, geographical, and economic obstacles are invariably faced in their pursuit of providing societies with acceptable, sustainable, and affordable solutions. Moreover, access to water, food and housing is not only globally desirable, but also the member states of the United Nations have declared them to be universal human rights . In an attempt to ensure that global action is taken to satisfy these rights, specifically defined Sustainable Development Goals have been agreed by the same member states. Will these help or hinder engineering efforts to address societal expectations? In this chapter, the challenges faced, both in the past and present, by engineers with regard to improving drinking water quality, increasing food quantity and quality, and providing adequate housing are discussed along with some observations on how and why some of the present obstacles may be exacerbated in the future.","['Energy', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Environmental and Sustainability Education', 'Sustainable Development', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Natural Resource and Energy Economics']"

However, inclusions cannot be avoided because steelmaking process is featured by intensive using of oxygen. As a result, how to remove inclusions from steel as much as possible is always a crucial task of steelmakers. However, inclusions cannot be completely removed from steel. So, natures of the remained inclusions must be strictly controlled, including the sizes, chemistry, morphologies and so on. At present, commercial steel grades can be roughly divided into three types by the choices of deoxidation in steelmaking. Most of the commercial steel grades is either with Al deoxidation or Si deoxidation, while only a few of them is with other deoxidation method such as Si–Al complex deoxidation. Because of wide application of Al as the deoxidant, how to control inclusions in Al-deoxidized steels is significant in both research and industrial production.

The first is to increase the intrinsic motivation of students to learn, by making the whole process more fun, enjoyable and competitive. The second is to facilitate the learning process by providing intuitive tools for the visualization of data structures and algorithmic output, together with a tool for automated assessment that decreases the dependence on the teacher and allows them to work more autonomously.

Most approaches have been focused on enclosing an invader using a particular formation. However, in terms of physical robot capability, it is hard to capture the invader practically. In this study, the invader has its escape cut off while multiple robots stand against it at some critical points on the invader’s path. The strategy consists of four parts. A graph is constructed on a given map for the Voronoi roadmap using the Voronoi diagram. Since constructed graph has a lot of nodes and edges, the thinning process is performed while reducing the computational load. Subsequently, candidate nodes are extracted on the whole map. If the invader escapes along the shortest path to the exit, the critical cluster is selected from the candidate nodes by checking the reachability of arrival times to the points. The proposed strategy is applied to a SLAM map using multiple robots. The results show that critical points are properly found, and all robots capture the invader successfully.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The relevant findings show that the EGBO algorithm is competitively superior in terms of resilience, precision, and latency when compared to other optimization methods.

As a result, annual population increases require high energy demand to provide essential needs and perform daily processes. To achieve sustainable development, energy sources ought to be reliable and have slight environmental problem. Photocatalytic water splitting by producing H 2 is an alternative approach to replace the traditional fossil fuels and providing environment friendly energy storage. Design in photocatalysts is essential to achieve economically applicable photocatalytic water splitting with higher efficiency. Sustainable hydrogen production would be a crucial first step toward powering fuel-cells. In addition, implementation on a larger industrial scale for attaining mature technological operations to lower N 2 and CO 2 emissions while producing desired products is achieved. The main challenge is harnessing solar radiation to produce hydrogen from water. In the coming decades, it is anticipated that wind-powered electrolysis and photovoltaics will be prioritized for producing renewable hydrogen. However, integrating catalysis with light harvesting for photoelectrolysis has various benefits. Among those benefits, thermal management and employment of lower current densities are preferable. Nowadays, semiconductor photocatalysis using solar energy is considered as a prospective way for disbanding the environment pollution and the global energy crises. It has been thoroughly studied in a variety of photocatalysis domains, including the reduction of pollution, the production of H 2 and O 2 , etc. The recent rising attention toward photocatalytic water splitting can be attributed to four-electron reaction mechanism.","['Materials Science', 'Energy Materials', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Environmental Chemistry', 'Energy Storage', 'Environmental Management']"

In fact, there are different methods for user’s behaviour analysis in the context of his experience assessment; however the corresponding tools mostly are focused on visual representation of user’s activities and system states transitions. User’s journey maps are a common user experience (UX) notation, which, depending on the context, can be used in a variety of ways. In UX tools, it is supported at the user interface (UI) development and testing stages as extended notation in multiple possible shapes, sizes, and formats. eStepControl is a tool, which supports identification and visual representation of IT system users behaviour, integrating UX analysis based on users journeys maps and gives an ability to analyse data about user sessions – to identify the most interesting cases for UX specialist and to make appropriate conclusions. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate functionality of eStepControl on the example of an internet bank, which is a suitable and logical representative of high UX importance in IT systems.

Digital signal processing is the name of this engineering branch. Advances in computer technology have led to the design of almost all signal processing methods with digital technology. Analog technology has been almost completely abandoned, and most newly manufactured devices are digitally designed. Signal processing techniques developed for continuous-time signals are adapted to digital signals. Some of these digital signal processing techniques are Fourier series representation of digital signals and digital Fourier transform. The formula for the Fourier series representation of digital signals is obtained using the Fourier series representation formula of continuous-time signals. Despite advances in computer technology, some signal processing algorithms are still time-consuming and need huge computation amount for computers. For this reason, algorithms are modified to run faster by computers. One of the best known of these algorithms is the fast Fourier transform algorithm developed in the 1960s. With the development of this algorithm, there has been an acceleration in the design of systems used for signal processing.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Coding and Information Theory', 'Algorithms']"

If the goal of reaching net zero by mid-century is to be achieved, global climate change must be urgently addressed, and the 50% benchmark of the phased reduction in emissions must be reached by the year 2030. Reducing carbon emissions in the operational sector of buildings remains an urgent priority. In addition, the production of most building construction materials remains carbon-intensive. Without quantifying and considering the embodied energy of the materials in our buildings, a significant obstacle continues to block the path of achieving net-zero emissions in the building sector. Aluminum and glass, both predominant materials in the building skin, have high embodied energy. It is imperative that buildings that achieve a net-zero status do so while ensuring that ALL sources of emissions, including embodied carbon, be taken into consideration. This study seeks to elucidate the definition of net-zero buildings to address these issues and to advance the knowledge of this category of buildings by addressing the impact and role of envelope materials and systems in reducing carbon footprint.","['Energy', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management']"

In order to ensure the privacy of individuals, agents’s information is interfered by independent random noises that obey Laplace distribution, and then sent to their neighbors. By resorting to Perron-Frobenius (PF) theorem, a fully distributed algorithm is established with perturbed local information, where the weights of the PF eigenvector are adopted. Since the mappings are strongly monotone and Lipschitz continuous, the algorithm we proposed guarantees the asymptotic convergence of NE and keeps the information privacy of each agent. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is proved to be $$\epsilon $$ ϵ -differentially private and the value of $$\epsilon $$ ϵ can be obtained.

To allow computing of arbitrary Boolean functions using such novel computing platforms, development of design automation flows (EDA) are of critical importance. Typically, EDA flows consist of multiple phases. Technology-independent logic synthesis is the first step, where the input Boolean function is restructured without any specific technology constraints, which is generally followed by a technology-dependent optimization phase, where technology specific hints are used for optimization of the data structure obtained from the first step. The final step is technology mapping, which takes the optimized function representation to implement it using technology-specific constraints. In this chapter, we present an end-to-end mapping framework for mMPU with various mapping objectives. We begin the chapter by presenting an optimal technology mapping method with the goal of mapping a Boolean function on a single row of mMPU. Thereafter, we propose a Look-Up Table (LUT) based mapping that attempts at minimizing delay of mapping, without any area constraints. We extend this method to work with area-constraints. The proposed framework is modular and can be improved with more efficient heuristics as well as technology-specific optimizations.

Two approaches are available for launch vehicle trajectory re-planning under the condition of satisfying constraints and residual capabilities: off-line re-planning and on-line re-planning. For off-line planning, the optimal parking and standby orbits are designed in advance considering the residual orbit entry and control capabilities of various failures. The optimal target orbit matching the current capability is chosen based on the current flight state and fault level under the condition of satisfying constraints and residual capabilities. Finally, the optimal guidance strategy is selected to complete the flight mission. For on-line planning, it is required to assess the launch vehicle’s residual orbit entry and control capabilities in real time, to achieve autonomous rapid planning using optimal trajectory planning control technology, to achieve dynamic processing of constraints during flight and relaxation of some constraints to ensure that on-line planning problems are solved and converged for on-line solving of optimal problem with the least fuel consumption or the largest radius of degraded orbit.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology']"

Buildings account for a significant part of worldwide energy consumption and are thus an essential aspect in moving towards a decarbonized and efficient energy sector. In particular it is important to retrofit existing buildings into net zero energy buildings. Microgrids allow the local integration of renewable energy generation technologies with energy storage and energy demand. In this work, the existing thermal and electrical models of the microgrid in a pilot zone of building C of LNEG campus in Lumiar were integrated, and energy management strategies in which the decision making is based on both models were developed. Two different strategies following a rule-based control approach were developed and tested. In the first one, depending on the state of charge (SOC) of the battery and energy prices, the battery charges with power from the utility grid. The last one builds upon the first one and adds a new control block for the heat pump, which also considers the battery SOC and the energy prices. This control strategy also proved to be the one that led to both the lowest consumption from the utility grid and the lowest energy bill, for most of the studied scenarios, but had the drawback of increasing discomfort in a specific room. The LNEG building was designed according to bioclimatic principles, in articulation with renewable energy systems, since its first stage of conception.","['Energy', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management']"

It is established that the passive type of reinforcements is more advantageous than the frictional type. Bearing reinforcement (BR) is a passive type of reinforcement. Bearing reinforcement (BR) is considered a cost-effective earth reinforcement. In the present study, there will be no bearing members beneath the footing, and all bearing members are considered beyond the edges of the footing. Available literature refers to the use of bearing reinforcement largely in Mechanically Stability Earth (MSE) walls. Earlier, researchers have numerically simulated bearing reinforcement as a frictional reinforcement with enhanced frictional resistance. In this paper, the results of numerical studies (using PLAXIS 2D) made of a strip footing resting on soil strata consisting of reinforced granular fill [with BR or frictional reinforcement] or granular fill without reinforcement, overlying clay, are being presented. It is seen that bearing reinforcement (BR) is effective when the length of reinforcement is more than 6 B . The reinforcements are considered to be sandwiched in the upper granular layer. It has been observed that the bearing capacity is influenced by the presence of reinforcement and also settlements are significantly reduced. Reinforcement of length 6 B shows better performance compared to 2 B and 4 B for the permissible limit of settlement. The ground shows better performance when the reinforcement is provided at the center of the granular bed when compared to reinforcement located at the interface of the granular bed and clay layer.

Recently, as the use of GNSS has become possible even in geostationary orbit satellites, real-time orbit determination using the navigation solution of the GNSS receiver has become possible. The conversion error generated in the ECEF to ECI coordinate transformation process, when using the navigation solution of the GNSS receiver, affects the orbit determination error.

Considering these points, in this paper extended Kalman filter based orbit determination algorithm that use the navigation solution of the GNSS receiver. To minimize the orbit transformation error, the post-processed orbit navigation solutions calculated using Earth Orientation Parameters are used as measurement values.

The interface behavior is majorly affected by the thickness of landfill liner (t), mass of landfill liner (m), tensile strength of landfill liner (T), cohesion of soil (cu), angle of shearing resistance of soil ( Φ ), shear strength ( τ ), and normal stress ( σ ). As the stability of landfill liner varies significantly from that of the soil due to the non-homogeneity and anisotropic character of the soil, it is critical to comprehend the interface behavior between the landfill liner and the soil. However, no prior research employing machine learning techniques to analyze the interface behavior between landfill liners and soil has been reported; a study using machine learning algorithms and artificial neural networks is carried out on 66 datasets to probe the interface behavior with the help of an ANACONDA navigator. Further, to understand the impact of input variables on the output variable, Pearson’s correlation coefficients were determined. Mean absolute error (MEA) is considered as a loss function, and the best model was chosen based on the r 2 -value. Random forest regressor (RFR) model is determined to be the best model among the available models with an r 2 -score of 0.99 and a minimum mean absolute error of 0.46.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Sustainable Development', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

Advanced FinFET technology introduces reduction in the SCEs. A tri-gate FinFET, where the range of the gate is 14 nm, is accomplished and presented here using Silvaco TCAD. The geometrical dimensions of the device are characterized based on the width and the height of the fin to attain an aspect ratio of 0.5, 1, and 2. It can be reformed in two ways where firstly width is constant with varying heights to get aspect ratio and vice versa. The electrical parameters such as I on current, threshold voltage, sub threshold current, drain-induced barrier lowering, and I on / I off current ratio are compared for the different aspect ratios to attain an optimized aspect ratio and also from the I D –V GS graph, the threshold voltage is determined with respect to V DS . The logarithmic I D –V GS graph depicts the leakage current. Thereby, the development of the TG FinFET structure is proposed, where the standardized schematic is at fixed height, width, and length of 10 nm.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Materials Science, general']"

Among them, the extraction and analysis of such short texts relies on accurately text similarity calculations. Due to the ambiguity and data sparsity of short text, improving the accuracy of calculations for the similarity of short text remains an important and challenging task. To solve this problem, this paper conducts an in-depth study on the unsupervised Chinese short text similarity algorithm and proposes a fusion algorithm based on phonetics and semantics. The algorithm takes the sound, character, and word-meaning of the short text as the features, through these features to construct the feature vectors and calculate its own similarity for each vector, and then calculate the comprehensive semantic similarity of the text through the fusion algorithm and finally complete the similarity calculation method that integrates the three features of phonetic, character and semantics. In this paper, our algorithm was experimentally verified by LCQMC, a Large-scale Chinese Question Matching Corpus and the accuracy was improved by up to 29.2% compared with the traditional text similarity algorithm.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Information Systems and Communication Service', 'Management of Computing and Information Systems']"

To get this type of concrete, different types of admixtures are added to increase the strength, durability and workability of concrete. For designing HPC, various types of admixtures are available in the market like fly ash, rice husk ash, alccofine, micro-silica, etc. These admixtures can be used up to a limit at which it gives maximum strength and beyond that limit strength of concrete decreases. The present experimental work is investigated on replacement of micro-silica with cement for 0, 7.5 and 10% with addition of super plasticizer. The concrete mix of M50 high-performance concrete is used in this experimental work. Two design mix specifications, i.e., Indian Standard (IS) and Department of Environment (DOE) British methods, are adopted for this work. Comparison of these two is carried out for compressive strength of concrete.

Sand cushioning, chemical stabilization, belled piers, granular pile anchors, and other techniques are only a few examples. It is also possible to reduce the swelling of expansive soil by stabilizing it with randomly distributed fibres. Geosynthetics such as geocells have been utilized as reinforcement in the construction of structures such as foundations, embankments, retaining walls, highways, and so on. This research article discusses the swelling characteristics of reinforced expansive soil. The swelling characteristics of geocell and jute fibre reinforced expansive soil specimens were investigated using one-dimensional swelling experiments in a CBR mould. The geocell reinforced specimen’s swell potential and swelling pressure dropped until 0.80% fibre content and then increased at 1.60% fibre content. Swell potential and swelling pressure reduced as fibre length increased, but only until 40 mm, after which they increased for fibre lengths of 50 and 60 mm. The rate of swelling confirms the above observation. In comparison with the unreinforced specimen, the swelling behaviour of geocell–jute fibre reinforced expansive soil specimens improved. The study highlights the use of geocells and jute fibre towards the stabilization of expansive soil.","['Engineering', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Environment, general']"

Moreover, during landing on such bodies, dust impingement on the lander module and Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) systems can cause serious complications. To prevent system failures due to scoured regolith, and also minimize contamination of surface regolith for sample collection, the rocket can be used to decelerate the spacecraft to a vertical descent velocity from which it can freefall. A Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) technique is developed to investigate the interaction of rocket plume with surface regolith of an airless extra-terrestrial body. Continuum breaks down as the exhaust exits the engine nozzle, and the gases expand rapidly into the vacuum. Near the nozzle exit, the process enters a rarefied flow regime and an open-source DSMC code is developed to model the movement and collision stages of rarefied plume gas and dust particles. In this simulation, the collision occurs between gas particles of the rocket plume as it impinges on such an extra-terrestrial surface. The solver used for carried out this simulation is dsmcFOAM solver, a part of OpenFOAM. The surface properties such as pressure coefficient and heat flux are computed and analysed to observe the impact of plume impingement on extra-terrestrial regolith.","['Energy', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Environmental Policy', 'Sociology, general']"

The Indian plate, which continues slamming into the Asian plate, is really the cause of the high frequency and intensity of earthquakes, with Northeast India being the most at hazardous location. Structures may not resist earthquakes completely, so the objective is to perform better during seismic action. Consequently, carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) cables are introduced that can make building safer from the devastating seismic forces. CFRP cables have a high-strength-to-weight ratio, are lightweight, and have no corrosion or fatigue issues. In order to resist ground motion during an earthquake event, a new method has been introduced using CFRP cables. Hundreds of CFRP cables were inserted from the rooftop to the ground, on the outer side of the building.

The impacts of cutting parameters such as feed rate, cutting speed, and depth of cut on output responses such as cutting forces, flank wear, and surface roughness were investigated using a Box-Behnken design based on response surface methodology (RSM). To find the optimum cutting condition, a newly developed hybrid optimization method, namely RSM-linked Artificial Gorilla Troop Optimization Algorithm and Dingo Optimization Algorithm, was utilized. The flank wear along with cutting force was recorded when the depth of cut was less while better surface finish was achieved with lower cutting speed. Additionally, analysis of variance was used to determine the most important component in each of the three responses, followed by a confirmatory test that revealed a high degree of agreement between anticipated and experimental results. As per the analysis of variance (ANOVA) results, the depth of cut was determined to be the most crucial component in attaining the lowest cutting force, flank wear, and surface roughness responses. The results obtained using the artificial gorilla optimization algorithm and the dingo optimization algorithm are found to be more precise than those obtained using the RSM-designed experimentation of dry turning operations, as cutting force, surface roughness, and flank wear have been minimized by utilizing the factor settings achieved using both the artificial gorilla optimization algorithm and the dingo optimization algorithm.","['Engineering', 'Materials Engineering', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Structural Materials', 'Biomaterials']"

In fact, as the working environment and operating conditions change, some inner parameters may be changed and become uncertainly. In this paper, a novel method of EMA performance based on uncertain parameters is proposed to solve the problem that the existing deterministic models are difficult to evaluate the actual performance of EMA. Firstly, a deterministic model is built on the AMESim simulation platform. Then, the probability analysis software NESSUS was used to consider the uncertainty of parameters, and the co-simulation model was established. Finally, the influence of parameter fluctuation on EMA system performance is studied by using this method. Simulation results verify the correctness of the proposed method. Compared with the traditional simulation method based on parameter determination, the model built by this method has higher precision, and the simulation results are closer to the real EMA prototype.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

The JIS standard compiles the findings from 2005 to 2007 and revised from 2018 to 2019. In these standards, the quality of recycled aggregate is divided into three levels: Classes H, M, and L. The applications of aggregates other than high-quality H are limited. However, Class-H aggregate has not been widely used because of the increased cost and energy required to produce better-quality recycled aggregate. One solution to this problem is to use a recycled aggregate of medium quality formed by mixing ordinary aggregate and recycled aggregate (mostly low-quality recycled aggregate) rather than using recycled aggregate alone in concrete. In this study, we investigate the strength and durability of concrete made from mixtures of recycled aggregates of different quality and normal aggregate. We confirm that the quality of concrete is higher when low-quality recycled aggregate mix ordinary aggregate than when alone use moderate-quality recycled aggregate.","['Energy', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Structural Materials', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Construction Management', 'Environmental Policy']"

In the Yamal Nenets Autonomous Okrug (YNAO) average winter temperatures were even lower, ranging from −20 to −25 °C. Temperatures are presently increasing in the area, and towards the end of this century, winter temperatures in the YNAO may, under a medium high emission scenario, resemble the previous conditions in the interior of Finnmark, while inland Finnmark may experience conditions that were earlier found along the fjords. The snow season in 1961–1990 typically lasted from 6 to 8 months in Finnmark. Higher temperatures lead to a reduced snow season and model calculations indicate a 3-month reduction along the coast, where it is shortest today, while the inland snow season may be one month shorter towards the end of the century. Along the coast, a 60% reduction in the winter maximum snow amount is projected towards the end of the century. In the interior of Finnmark, considerably smaller changes are projected in maximum snow amounts, as average precipitation is projected to increase, implicating increased snowfall during winter. Maximum snow amounts may even increase slightly at some inland sites. Higher winter temperatures will lead to changes in the snow structure. Compared to herders’ reports, the SNOWPACK model successfully reproduced high-density snow layers during the past decades.

The dynamic response of the cabin environment encompassing the seats, front/rear windshields, windows, and dashboard of the car has been studied in detail. Experiments were conducted for four different cases (Cases-1 to 4) to investigate the influence of (i) parking direction, (ii) opening of windows, (iii) radiation shielding of dashboard, and (iv) radiation shielding of windshields and windows, on the cabin environment. Case-1 experiments were carried out as a baseline case to investigate the influence of parking directions north, south, east, and west on the cabin environment, having all the windows closed. The results showed that for Chennai region, parking the car west with all windows closed could lead to higher cabin air temperatures (60–65 ℃) with dashboard reaching as high as 85 ℃. On the other hand, radiation shielding of dashboard alone was found to reduce the cabin air temperatures by 5–8 ℃, whereas radiation shielding of windshields (both front and rear) as well as the windows has been found to lower the cabin air temperatures by about 15–20 ℃.","['Energy', 'Energy Systems', 'Energy Storage', 'Renewable and Green Energy']"

Solar energy, which generates both heat and light, is the most abundant source of energy. Solar photovoltaic modules use solar radiations to generate electricity and thermal energy, while the remaining solar radiation content is lost to the environment. The first law of thermodynamics was used to perform an energy analysis on a solar photovoltaic module, and the second law of thermodynamics was used to perform an exergy analysis to determine energy losses and exergy efficiency during the photovoltaic conversion process. The operating parameters of a solar photovoltaic module are as follows: ambient temperature, photovoltaic module surface temperature, overall heat transfer coefficient, short circuit current, open circuit voltage, fill factor and solar radiation. These were achieved on a sunny day in the month of February at R.L.J.I.T, Doddaballapur. The experimental data are utilised to calculate the solar photovoltaic module’s energy and exergy efficiencies. The efficiency of the solar panel performance decreases as the temperature of the module rises. As a result, by reducing heat from the surface of the solar photovoltaic module, the module’s efficiency can be increased. Surface heat can be eliminated by delivering water or air as a medium to the solar photovoltaic module. Finally, ANN model was developed to determine the performance prediction models using multilayer perceptron neural network, and it reveals that the developed model with six neurons gives better performance with a confidence interval of 95%.","['Engineering', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Energy Storage']"

This is a good thing from a normal human perspective as it is giving an opportunity to the lower income people to earn the bread on their own but this development has its own consequences. With an objective to improve the connectivity between two points, the infrastructure projects are awarded without significant consideration towards environment. This study presents an estimate of damage produced by vehicle operations in terms of monetary values. This gives an opportunity to the Indian infrastructure planners to take environmental damage cost into account for selecting a suitable alignment between two nodes, which is not a common practice in India. The study included a two-fold objective to quantify the emissions from vehicles of typical national highway traffic in terms of capital cost and to compare the changes in the cost associated with the emissions by shifting vehicle operation from BS IV to BS VI. In order to achieve the objectives, secondary data from an alignment of Maharashtra and Karnataka was utilized. The study adopts a methodology of finding out the difference in the cost between BS IV and BS VI vehicular operation based on standard emission norms and unit costs of pollutants suggested by researchers around the globe. This gives us an approximate estimate of how much damage is posed to the environment and health effects on nearby residents or users of the link by operating a vehicle for one km. Data collected from various reports give an indication of the total overhead cost to upgrade the fuel technology and vehicles as per BS VI norms.","['Engineering', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Sustainable Development']"

We consider a multi-agent system whose motion is carried out towards a common goal according to algorithms of swarm behavior based on Reynolds rules: speed matching, collision avoidance with neighbors and attraction to neighbors. Three approaches to modeling swarming behavior based on articles (Olfati-Saber, Flocking for multi-agent dynamic systems: algorithms and theory. IEEE Trans Autom Control, 51(3), 2016; Olfati-Saber, Murray, Flocking with obstacle avoidance: cooperation with limited communication in mobile networks. In: 42nd IEEE international conference on decision and control, vol 2, 2022–2028) are presented. The peculiarities of this work are that the approaches considered together help to realize such a model of motion, which ensures the avoidance of collision with all available types of obstacles. The method is intended for implementation in those spaces, where there will be many autonomous vehicles. The main problem is that when a dynamic obstacle is encountered, congestion can occur—the agents closest to the obstacle react quickly, while distant agents do so with a lag and create crush. The goals of this paper are to propose a method of indirectly transmitting danger information between swarm members without using communication channels. This means that those robots that do not see the danger can get information about it from other agents by observing their behavior. For this purpose, a method of escaping from a pack from a “predator” based on Q-learning is implemented.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Cities, Countries, Regions', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Statistics, general']"

The global interest in the Arctic territories requires a new approach to design, which will ensure the sustainability of these regions. The promising Double-Skin Facad design predicts a solution to a range of problems. But, it is worth noting that this design has been little studied and requires scientific substantiation. A study was made of the effect of the width of the buffer zone of the double facade on the results of thermal engineering calculations of two-dimensional temperature fields. The Arctic city of Murmansk was chosen as the base region for the study. Six variants of the construction of the “floor—outer wall” node were considered. Thermal calculations for each of the options were performed using the Elcut 6.4 software. The calculation results are summarized in a single table and confirm the hypothesis of the relevance of using a double facade structure in a cold region. The relationship between the width of the buffer zone and the thermal conductivity of the double facade structure is found. With an increase in the buffer zone, the average temperature of the two inner surfaces increases systemically, and, accordingly, the difference in their temperatures decreases. The Double-Skin Facad creates the self-illuminated effect required for the Arctic regions and demonstrates sufficient energy efficiency.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology', 'Building Materials']"

Countries like India also tried their best to manage this Covid outbreak situation through lockdown and handle its growth through strict relaxation using zonal distribution strategy. An urge of proper estimation for this outbreak is required, which can be beneficial in arrangement of proper healthcare facilities in different states of the country. India has wide diversity between its states. The effect of temperature and dense population have been two key parameters that have been poorly studied with respect to each state. In this paper, we tried to forecast the number of Covid-19 cases (8 Jan 2020 to 25 April 2020) using Kalman filter at state and national levels to generate various trends and patterns. Our analysis has been evaluated on four classification of states: most affected, moderate affected, least affected and pandemic free states. The results have been collected on vulnerable temperature parameters (historical and forecast data) of each state. The national level estimates are further compared with other countries like United States of America, Spain, France, Italy and Germany through confirmed, recovered and death cases. In the current lockdown situation our estimation shows that India should expect as many as 60,140 cases by May 24, 2020. The trends achieved shows that India has been found to be one of the beneficiaries of lockdown decisions but failed at some places in its regions due to social activities, huge dense population and temperature variation.

In this research, solid waste was produced by dredging Kashmir’s renowned Dal Lake. Dal Lake in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, produces a significant amount of dredged dirt, presenting severe health and environmental issues. Concerns about the environmental impacts of dredging and disposal, as well as the growing scarcity of appropriate disposal locations, have increased the need for dredged material characterization. As such, the purpose of this research is to describe the waste material produced by Dal Lake by examining its different physical and mechanical characteristics. Dredged material was collected from the Shalimar site, which is located within the Dal Lake catchment, for the purpose of conducting various field and laboratory tests to determine field density, soil classification, compaction characteristics, and strength parameters such as unconfined compressive strength and direct shear test. The findings indicate that dredged material is mostly composed of silt, clay, and sand, and that strength characteristics indicate that dredged material cannot be utilized in its natural form as building and foundation material. As a result, appropriate and practical treatments should be applied to dredged material in order to enable its use in geotechnical applications.","['Engineering', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Environment, general']"

One important aspect is to figure out the influences of critical parameters on the engine performance and aircraft mission assessment. This paper carries out sensitivity analysis regarding the T4, component efficiency and pressure ratio, aiming at achieving the most influential factors for engine design. The increment for each parameter was scheduled as 1, 2 and 3% separately to uncover the dominant factors. Furthermore, the effects of a 3% increase in the parameters individually were studied in both the steady-state and mission level performance. It is found that Fan efficiency and LPT efficiency were the most important factors that impact engine steady-state performance. The 3% increase in the two factors would result in 1.75 and 1.49% reduction in SFC whereas 2.12 and 1.52% boost in net thrust. This finding has highlighted the importance of improving the efficiency of the low-pressure system. After reaching the optimum T4 limit, the thermal efficiency is reluctant to ascend for the fixed OPR case. Furthermore, the betterment in component efficiency is preferred and lead to a noticeable improvement in reducing block fuel and emitted emissions. The corresponding fuel saving, NO x and CO 2 emission prevention were 2.30, 4.06 and 2.29% respectively when the Fan efficiency is levelled up by 3%.

The accumulated homo-charges on the insulator surface significantly relax the electric field at the DC steady state, thus improving the theoretical discharge inception voltage under DC superimposed homopolar impulse voltage but reducing that under DC superimposed heteropolar impulse voltage. When the voltage polarity is reversed in two minutes, the intensified electric field on the insulator surface shifts from the GND electrode towards the vicinity of the HV electrode, in which the maximum electric field grows by 21.4% and increases as the reversal time shortens.

This work aims at enhancing the lateral stability of high-rise structures having asymmetry in plan along with variation in lateral stiffness at different floor levels, by adopting an effective lateral load resisting system. In the present work, two high-rise structures having 60 storeys each with different shapes in plan have been considered as a case study. One of the high-rise structures has irregularity in plan, and the other has symmetry in plan. Both high-rise structures considered have different storey heights at certain floor levels leading towards variation in lateral stiffness of the structures at the respective floor levels. A nonlinear seismic (response spectrum) and wind analysis has been carried out on both high-rise structures considered for the study. The maximum storey displacement, storey stiffnesses, storey shear for different load combinations of gravity loads (dead and live loads), along with earthquake and wind loads applied individually, are recorded for both high-rise structures. Both the high-rise structures considered in this study are located in zone V , and a maximum wind speed of 50 m/s is considered for wind pressure calculations. The results showed that the maximum storey displacements for both high-rise structures having different shapes in plan subjected to earthquake and wind loads were comparatively high. It is observed that the lateral displacements were found to be higher in the high-rise structure that has asymmetry in plan when compared to the structure having symmetry in plan. Three different lateral load resisting systems have been applied individually, on both high-rise structures whilst carrying out the earthquake and wind analysis separately, to assess the performance of the individual lateral load resisting systems. The three different lateral load resisting systems considered in the analyses are steel bracings, diagrids and shear walls. Two types of steel bracings: X and V bracings have been applied individually on both high-rise structures whilst carrying out the analyses. Combinations of the lateral load resisting systems have been applied on both high-rise structures having different shapes in plan, subjected to earthquake and wind so as to arrive at an effective combination of the lateral load resisting system, when applied enhances the lateral stability and reduces the lateral storey displacements of the high-rise structures having plan and storey stiffness irregularity.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Building Materials', 'Structural Materials']"

Previous work can obtain high-quality mesh when the input data is dense and evenly distributed. Although many reconstruction algorithms that can get high-quality meshes have been proposed, the quality of the obtained meshes will be degraded when encountering some particular circumstances, such as noise and data missing. This article introduces a surface reconstruction method with good performance despite non-uniformly distributed and missing data. We supplement the input with the sketch and estimate the normal of the sketch globally based on Duchon energy which makes the estimated normal accurate and smooth. Then we use the signed distance function, whose zero iso-surface represents the surface, to combine the sketch with the original input and compute the implicit function as the solution of a sparse linear system. The experimental results show that this method can generate a high-quality mesh. The use of smoothness energy allows our approach to be much more resilient to sampling imperfections than existing methods. In addition, the technique can add sketches to existing models to obtain 3D models that are more in line with the creator’s intent.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Computational Intelligence']"

The portfolios are built following the two approaches on historical stock prices from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020. The portfolio performances are evaluated on the test data from January 1, 2021, to November 1, 2021. The backtesting results of the portfolios indicate that the performance of the HRP portfolio is superior to that of its Eigen counterpart on both training and the test data for the majority of the sectors studied.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Statistics, general', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

However, it is challenging to weld the aluminium using a conventional arc welding process, due to the formation of aluminium oxide on the surface of the aluminium. TIG welding process is one of the suitable welding processes for welding aluminium alloy. However, TIG welding of aluminium alloy depends on multiple parameters such as voltage, current, and scan speed. The experimental analysis of the welding process is time-consuming and costly. Finite element analysis (FEA) is one of the preferable methods of predicting the welding process and parameters. In this study, the effect of various welding parameters, i.e. voltage, current, and scan speed, on the weld pool formation is analysed using the FEA process. The weld pool thermal behaviours concerning time have been predicted by considering Gaussian heat source utilizing FEA software (ANSYS). The FEA analysis of the welding process showed that melt pool size increases with an increase in welding current and decreases with the increase in scan speed.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering']"

Studies show the failure of such portions to cause catastrophic brittle failure. In this study, low strength concrete, code compliant joint is simulated using Concrete Damaged Plasticity (CDP) model in ABAQUS. The biggest challenge in numerical studies is the selection of material models and to accurately replicate the experimental behavior. Therefore, In the present study an exterior RC joint under monotonic loading is selected from published data to check the reliability of numerical prediction. The compressive behavior is replicated using Hognestad’s parabola and the tensile behavior is calculated using American Concrete Institute guidelines. Reinforcement is modelled discretely, and the concrete-steel interface is assumed to be rigid in connection. The comparison of numerical and experimental load deflection curve reveals a reasonable agreement with each other. The finding of present study provides a reference for the future parametric studies to investigate the RC joints progressive collapse behavior.","['Engineering', 'Fire Science, Hazard Control, Building Safety', 'Natural Hazards', 'Sustainable Development']"

Most importantly, it provides a starting place for those interested in learning about this type of analysis and considerations that users should be aware of. Those unfamiliar with exploratory data analysis may find the article helpful in understanding what will be covered during their dissertation process. Terrorism is a term we use to refer to violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims. Terrorism has been around for about two centuries, but it did not gain much traction until the 1970s. Terrorism is defined as violent acts against innocent people committed to making an impact on society or government. The underlying causes of terrorism are usually motivated by injustice, revenge, oppression, retaliation, conflict, and hostility borne out of inequality among countries. Furthermore, it is associated with religious extremism and usually targets civilian populations to cause death or destruction. As a result of these patterns in manifestation and potential consequences worldwide, terrorism has become a pressing global issue that requires attention at multilateral levels. In this article, we have tried to cover all the aspects of terrorist data analysis using various machine learning algorithms like support vector machine and linear regression. After analyzing the above datasets by the said model, we have figured out which region is mainly affected by attacks and where the cases of terrorists have been seen frequently. Here, we have tried to explain what it means to do this kind of research and provide some considerations for those who want to use this approach for their work.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security']"

Several critical parameters such as pressure and free surface velocity, along with free surface elevation control the efficiency of OWC. In presented work, a study is carried out in ANSYS Fluent Solver. For generating wave in a NWT., Stokes 5 th order wave theory is applied (Michael Horko (2007) CFD optimization of an Oscillating Water Column Wave Energy Converter. M.S. Thesis, The University of Western Australia. s.l.:s.n.). A porous media is used for pressure generation and damping. The effects of power take-off damping are observed during the simulations. A good agreement in simulation results can be seen with Kamath et al. and Thomas et al., which are validated. Further, this study aims to increase the efficiency of OWC. This paper provides a numerical analysis for modified upper OWC chamber shape and four vertical plates inside the chamber.

Hence, water that is used for agriculture, marine culture, human consumption, etc., should be in good condition to minimize the hazardous effect of water pollution on human health. Rapid unsustainable industrialization, improper huge waste disposal, excess amount fertilizer usage, etc., are responsible for the rapid deterioration of the water quality in rivers and other freshwater bodies. Manual continuous water quality measurement is risky, expensive, and time-consuming. Hence, it is essential to forecast the water quality using statistical time series models. In this paper, three widely used statistical multivariate techniques such as Vector Moving Average (VMA), Vector Auto Regression (VAR), and Vector Auto Regression Moving Average (VARMA), are investigated to forecast water quality parameters like Fecal Coliform (FC), Total Coliform (TC), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), and the associated Water Quality Index (WQI) of the Ganga River. Most of the previous methods worked on forecasting the future values based on past values of individual parameters without considering the interdependency among the water quality parameters. Here, correlation among each parameter is estimated. Subsequently, the future values of a parameter are estimated based on its previous values and the previous values of its correlated parameters. The proposed research work can help properly manage the water quality of the river Ganga by utilizing the forecasted results for the planning of the pollution control strategies. Finally, it helps improve the quality of human beings by minimizing the health issues caused by water pollution.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

The appearance of pilot-industrial projects to apply mechanisms of faster heat transfer (radiant mechanism) or without influence in the molecules that form the gas (heating of the steel by induction heat transfer) is more and more frequent. In all the cases, the physical–chemical characteristics of the atmospheres that are in contact with the steel have influence on the changes that can be produced on the surface of the steel that is being processed. On many occasions, as we are talking about large productions (millions of tons), it is not the objective to avoid the surface oxidation, which involves important metallurgical losses. The high operation and energy costs that can involve an atmosphere that could avoid the oxidation do not compensate the metallurgical losses associated with the oxidation. This chapter, dedicated to the atmospheres for the heat treatment of steels, is supported with solved exercises. This knowledge is adequate to understand the superficial changes that can be observed in the surface of the steel.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Structural Materials']"

However, there are drawbacks in the terrace houses in tropical climatic conditions due to restrictions on providing thermal comfort. Newly introduced expanded polystyrene (EPS)-based lightweight concrete wall panel has less self-weight and less thermal conductivity and absorbs less heat to minimize thermal effect. This detailed study was carried to assess the applicability of EPS-based lightweight concrete wall panels as the wall material of terrace houses with proper passive design in order to enhance the indoor thermal comfort. Three storey terrace houses have been developed to comply with the locally adopted building regulations. These houses have been assessed with the aid of computer simulations carried out using the DesignBuilder software using the climatic data pertaining to different climates. Comparative studies were conducted to determine the thermal behaviour of the terrace house by modifying various factors in six ways, such as materials, thickness, climatic condition, orientation of house cluster, floors and courtyard formations. As an outcome of these detailed studies, a set of ideas and rules were developed for improvement in internal temperature of terrace houses.","['Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Sustainable Development', 'Building Materials', 'Building Construction and Design']"

Influential users can be detected through different centrality measures. When the rumor is generated through some influential users, they have more impact on society. Here, we have proposed a prognostic method to distinguish those influential users of online social media, based on network analysis. The susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model has been used for simulation of the propagation of information. For the particular seed nodes which have been chosen by practicing different centrality measures, detailed relative learning in terms of infected nodes is also exhibited. Selection of seed nodes through centrality measure is computationally exhaustive; therefore, we form a composite model, where the original social network is decomposed using the k-core, and centrality nodes are obtained from that decomposed network. Centrality measurements thus derived from the generated network are used as the seed of information propagation. Another important result derived from the empirical study is that not only the influential nodes, but neighbors of the influential nodes also have a greater impact on maximizing the effect of rumors.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics']"

One limitation is that most protocols do not separate or assemble (i.e., “phase”) the nucleotide content of each of the maternally and paternally derived chromosomal homologs making up the 22 autosomal pairs and the chromosomal pair making up the pseudo-autosomal region of the sex chromosomes. This has led to a dearth of studies and a consequent underappreciation of many phenomena of fundamental importance to basic and clinical genomic science. We discuss a few protocols for obtaining phase information as well as their limitations, including those that could be used in tumor phasing settings. We then describe a number of biological and clinical phenomena that require phase information. These include phenomena that require precise knowledge of the nucleotide sequence in a chromosomal segment from germline or somatic cells, such as DNA binding events, and insight into unique cis vs. trans -acting functionally impactful variant combinations—for example, variants implicated in a phenotype governed by compound heterozygosity. In addition, we also comment on the need for reliable and consensus-based diploid-context computational workflows for variant identification as well as the need for laboratory-based functional verification strategies for validating cis vs. trans effects of variant combinations. We also briefly describe available resources, example studies, as well as areas of further research, and ultimately argue that the science behind the study of human diploidy, referred to as “diplomics,” which will be enabled by nucleotide-level resolution of phased genomes, is a logical next step in the analysis of human genome biology.","['Life Sciences', 'Genetics and Genomics']"

Substantial amount of time, resource, and energy is required to obtain experimental data like CBR values and other parameters in road sub-base constructions. Application of multivariate regression models can be used in predicting the CBR values, and other properties of the stabilized soil have a potential of reducing the total time and cost of construction. In this study, fly ash is used as stabilizing agent for clayey soils in road sub-base construction; then, multivariate models are developed to predict the CBR values and other properties of soil. Different percentages of fly ash were added to clayey soil, and then, CBR test and direct shear test were performed. With the obtained values, multivariate linear and non-linear regression models were developed to check the usefulness in prediction of the properties. In this paper, addition of 20% fly ash by dry weight of soil is recommended for clayey soil stabilization.

The present work focuses on restoring the lateral stability and the load carrying capacity of a five storey reinforced concrete structure that has undergone damage when subjected to an earthquake. The reinforced concrete structure considered in this study is an old structure that has not been designed for earthquake resistance. A nonlinear seismic analysis adopting response spectrum method is carried out on the reinforced concrete structure that is constructed in zone V. After carrying out the earthquake analysis, it is learnt that few columns have failed because the RC columns have not been designed for resisting earthquake loads. The internal forces and lateral displacements of such failed RC columns present in the structure are assessed to study the extent of damage that has taken place in such RC columns and RC beams. It is observed from the results that the lateral storey displacements are larger in the structures having the RC columns and beams not designed for seismic resistance when subjected to earthquake loading. When RC jacketing is applied on to the distressed RC columns present in structure and the seismic analysis is there after carried out, it is observed that the lateral storey displacement has reduced, there by improving the lateral stability of the structure whose damaged RC columns are retrofitted for future earthquakes. In the case of RC columns, only those columns that have undergone large lateral displacement and have been damaged excessively are replaced with composite columns (encased column). The connection between the new replaced composite column and the existing RC floor beams is considered as fixed in the analysis, as in the actual site condition, the I-section and reinforcement present in the encased composite columns are welded to the reinforcement of the RC beams (top and bottom floor beams). It is observed from the analysis of the structure that houses the encased columns, that is provided as a replacement in place of the excessively damaged RC columns, there is a reduction in lateral storey displacement and there is a comparative increase in moment and lateral shear carrying capacity. It is observed from the results that, the RC jacketing of damaged RC columns tends to have lower lateral storey displacements when compared to the damaged RC columns that are replaced adopting encased columns having the same size of the original columns.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Building Materials', 'Structural Materials']"

In this research, ACO is used to optimize individuals with graph structure. This structure is exactly like the approach taken by genetic network programming (GNP) for individual representation for solving agent control problems. However, in some types of environments such as stochastic environments, calculated fitness of an individual is not the same in each evaluation. Therefore, to estimate the true fitness of an individual, several times of evaluation are needed leading to increased process time of the evolution. In this research, a method is proposed to avoid slowing down the progress speed of the algorithm using ACO. This method can be well adapted on graph structures and in each iteration, it enhances the fitness of individuals using a constructive mechanism. In constructive mechanism, an individual is produced according to the experience of previous generations. In this research, the experience is the achieved fitness and it is distributed on the corresponding paths in the graph structure. This new method was used to solve an agent control problem called Pursuit-Domain while the environment is deterministic or stochastic.

Bacterial contamination in drinking water, like Shigella flexneri , Vibrio cholera , Salmonella enterica , E. coli , and others, is a major source of pathogenic pollutants. The current study proposes a photonic crystal (Ph.C.) micro square ring resonator (MSRR) sensor that is small in size and has a fast output response time to detect the signature of single waterborne bacteria. The bacterial contamination in water varies the refractive index and in turn resonance wavelength shift at the throughput port is observed. The transmission spectrum is determined by using FDTD simulation of Ansys Lumerical software for the suggested structure and the impurity is determined by examining the resonance peak wavelength shift. The proposed structure is ultra-sensitive and compact in size having sensitivity of almost 946 nm/RIU and the structure would be useful for a variety of sensing purposes.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Statistics, general', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Sociology, general', 'Professional Computing']"
doi:10.1007/978-981-19-2886-4_7,en,Modeling of Reinforced Concrete Beam–Column Joint Retrofitting,OriginalPaper,"Failure of reinforced concrete (RC) beam–column joints (BCJs) is sudden especially when they are subjected to high shear demands caused by seismic actions. One novel advantageous method is shear retrofitting of BCJs with carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) using an externally bonding technique. CFRP is a lightweight, high strength, flexible, and corrosion-resistant material, and the proposed system is highly efficient and exhibits high shear capacities compared to other retrofitting methods such as concrete and steel jacketing. A recent experimental study on retrofitting of reinforced concrete BCJs using composites shows that the CFRP retrofitting configurations significantly improved the behavior of deficient joints. Strengthened specimens exhibited significant increases in strength and energy dissipation capacities as compared to the unstrengthened control specimen. The lateral load capacities of strengthened specimens increased by 50–100% when compared to the control specimen. Cracks propagated diagonally from one corner to the other corner of the joint. Therefore, CFRP fibers were oriented diagonally closer to principal stresses to prevent shear cracks in the joint core. The anchorages were applied to the beam, preventing the debonding of the CFRP sheets which gave a superior retrofitting effect. However, in the context of RC, shear behavior is still a riddle, exploring shear strengthening optimization as a challenge. The current study verifies the nonlinear numerical simulation potential of beam–column joint retrofitting using the experimental database. CFRP thickness is identified as a governing strengthening parameter via the FE analyses. The failure load increases with the increase of CFRP thickness, but the change in the ultimate load is not proportional to the increment of the thickness of the CFRP material.","['Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Sustainable Development', 'Building Materials', 'Building Construction and Design']"

As MgO is widely used for slag making and ladle lining, spinel inclusions can be formed very easily in secondary refining, causing various problems in casting and also in final products. Hence, research works were carried out with the attempt to relieve bad effects of high-melting-point inclusions. Usually, solid inclusions in Al deoxidized steel can be modified into low-melting-temperature ones by Ca-treatment. Whereas, large D-type inclusions are not easy to prevent during Ca-treatment. As [Ca] can also be supplied into liquid steel bulk by chemical reactions between steel and basic slag, hence, present authors wanted to find out how to target low-melting-point inclusions in Al deoxidized special steel by slag refining. Before the conduction of a series of laboratorial experiments, it would be desirable to carry out thermodynamic calculations for deeper insights on this topic. Hence, the work in this chapter was done. It was found that targeting low-melting-point inclusions in Al deoxidized steel by slag-steel reaction is feasible, in which the high basicity high alumina refining slag should be used.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Structural Materials', 'Materials Engineering']"

Numerical modelling of condensation with additional non-condensable gases has been a challenging task for researchers due to coupling of species transport with other fundamental governing equations. Eulerian wall film multiphase model in commercial Ansys Fluent software is used with coupling with species transport equation. Coupling is achieved by diffusion balance model which takes into account diffusion-controlled film condensation of water vapour over a plate. The model is validated on benchmarking data popularly known as CONAN experiments, wherein mixture of steam and air flow into a square cross section duct with water used as coolant. Condensation rates, heat flux and correlation based on heat and mass transfer analogy are validated using CONAN benchmarking data. In all simulations, only condensation on wall is considered and condensation in volume is neglected because of its very low contribution in film condensation. This study provides a methodology to simulate condensation in presence of non-condensable gas without use of any additional user-defined functions.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Solid Mechanics', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

The clay content of earth matters much in the cohesion and adhesion properties of blocks. This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation in characterizing the properties of soil stabilized adobe, adopting the pugging method. Different stabilizers, viz., cement and lime in different percentages of clay content are added to the soil. The strength properties like density, compressive strength, water absorption, and initial rate of absorption (IRA) are discussed. The influence of the different percentages of clay content and different types of stabilizers on the strength properties of blocks are examined. From the study, it is observed that as the water increases density decreases. Amongst the stabilizers cement shows higher density and compressive strength compared to lime and a combination of cement and lime. Soil containing 10% clay shows higher compressive strength than soil with 15% clay. Water absorption is higher in the soil with lime alone as stabilizers than in the soil with cement alone and a combination of cement and lime as stabilizers.

They have primary importance in blast-related research. The pressure–time profile parameters, such as peak overpressure, positive time duration, and decay coefficient of the shockwave, depend on the shock tube parameters (STPs) such as driver length, driven length, and burst pressure. We can generate shockwaves with the desired pressure–time profile by effectively tuning the STP. This study experimentally investigates the effect of driver length on the pressure–time profile of a shockwave generated by a blastwave simulator. Increasing the driver length increases the positive phase duration and peak overpressure at all probe locations. Also, it increases Friedlander profile formation distance. Further, a finite element model for shock tube is developed in ABAQUS/Explicit and the numerical results are compared with the experimental observations.

The application of electrochemical promotion of catalysis (EPOC), especially that achieved through alkaline conductors (alkaline-EPOC), has been found to be extremely effective in ECC-related reaction systems. Its use made it possible to decipher the role and mode of action of alkaline promoters on these reactions, thus enabling the successful transfer of the obtained knowledge to the design of highly effective and simple, alkaline-promoted conventional catalyst formulations (alkaline-CPC), readily applicable in exhaust gas systems.

The results show that when MVG moves downstream, the high pressure area in SWBLI region will gradually weaken or even disappear. The boundary layer thickness of SWBLI will gradually decrease; this shows that dynamic MVG has a good control effect on SWBLI.

This paper presents methods to solve this problem. Specifically, the shortest path between two given points in the 3D space of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is generated, and the generated path is traced. Moreover, the designed controller is introduced. The path generation algorithm is based on the existing path generation algorithm pertaining to the Dubins curve. The path generated by this algorithm can satisfy the constraints regarding the minimum allowable turning radius; moreover, the algorithm involves rapid computation and can be applied for path generation in real time. Notably, in this algorithm, the shortest path to fixed initial and final points is geometrically obtained in a 2D plane; however, real aircraft path generation problems must be implemented in 3D. Therefore, a path in 3D space is generated by deriving a solution through a numerical technique, using the same principle as that of the problem in 2D. Furthermore, the line-of-sight guidance algorithm corresponds to basic waypoint guidance. The proposed 3D path tracking approach is implemented using a nonlinear controller, resembling those of line-of-sight guidance algorithms. The controller guarantees, under certain assumptions, asymptotic tracking of the path, in terms of both the position and attitude. Finally, we adopt a sliding mode controller, which is a robust controller that can ensure high control performance and stability even under uncertainties. The proposed controller satisfies the constraint through the saturation function, specifically, by introducing the constraint on the angular velocity to the existing sliding mode controller. The stability of the designed controller is verified considering Lyapunov stability, and the performance of the proposed algorithm is verified through numerical simulation.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"
