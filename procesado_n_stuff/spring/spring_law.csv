Examples refer to coastal engineering applications as well as geotechnical or biomedical applications. Albeit the frequent applications, slight inconsistencies in the formulation of the governing equations can be found in the literature. The main goal of this paper is to identify these differences and provide a quantitative assessment of different approaches. Following a review of the different formulations, simulation results obtained from three alternative formulations are compared with experimental and numerical data. Results obtained by 2D and 3D test cases indicate that the predictive differences returned by the different formulations remain small for most applications, in particular for small porous Reynolds number Re P < 5000. Thus it seems justified to select a simplified formulation that supports an efficient algorithm and coding structure in a computational fluid dynamics environment. An estimated accuracy depending on the porous Reynolds number or the mean grain diameter is given for the simplified formulation.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

To deal with this issue, a feasible attitude trajectory generation method is proposed that utilizes a multiresolution technique and local attitude node adjustment to obtain sufficient time and quaternion nodes to satisfy the pointing constraints. These nodes are further used to calculate the continuous attitude trajectory based on quaternion polynomial interpolation and the inverse dynamics method. Then, the characteristic parameters of these nodes are extracted to transform the path-planning problem into a parameter optimization problem aimed at minimizing energy consumption. This problem is solved by an improved hierarchical optimization algorithm, in which an adaptive parameter-tuning mechanism is introduced to improve the performance of the original algorithm. A numerical simulation is performed, and the results confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

In the past 50 years, several structural concepts have been proposed, but none have been sent into orbit. One of the main challenges of the SSPS is dynamic behavior prediction, which can supply the necessary information for control strategy design. The ultra-large size of the SSPS causes difficulties in its dynamic analysis, such as the ultra-low vibration frequency and large flexibility. In this paper, four approaches for the numerical analysis of the dynamic problems associated with the SSPS are reviewed: the finite element, absolute nodal coordinate, floating frame formulation, and structure-preserving methods. Both the merits and shortcomings of the above four approaches are introduced when they are employed in dynamic problems associated with the SSPS. Synthesizing the merits of the aforementioned four approaches, we believe that embedding the structure-preserving method into finite element software may be an effective way to perform a numerical analysis of the dynamic problems associated with the SSPS.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

In this study, the dynamics of a spherical particle interacting with the steel—slag interface is numerically investigated using the volume of fluid method in combination with the overset grid technique to account for particle motion. The simulations have shown the particle’s separation process at the interface and successfully captured the formation and continuous evolution of a meniscus in the course of particle motion. A sensitivity analysis on the effect of different physical parameters in the steel—slag—particle system is also conducted. The result indicates that the wettability of particle with the slag phase is the main factor affecting particle separation behavior (trapped at the interface or fully separated into slag). Higher interfacial tension of fluid interface and smaller particle size can speed up the particle motion but have less effect on the equilibrium position for particle staying at the interface. In comparison, particle density shows a minor influence when the motion is dominated by the capillary effect. By taking account of the effect of meniscus and capillary forces on a particle, this study provides a more accurate simulation of particle motion in the vicinity of the steel—slag interface and enables further investigation of more complex situations.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

Literatures are sparsely particularly that of test work and simulation with PBM model on this aspect. The oil dewatering performance of a disc centrifuge has been studied with both test and simulation, which was based on population balance model (PBM). The gradient of the concentration and size of water droplets has been revealed. The results show that the simulation of PBM model is more realistic; the coalescence probability of water droplets is much greater than the fragmentation probability; due to the coalescence behavior of water droplets, the oil—water separation process will be easier; and the separation efficiency will be 1%–2% higher than that of conventional Euler—Euler model. In addition, when the separation efficiency reaches the peak, the optimal disc gap is about 0.5 mm.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

The proposed numerical model was applied to simulate the cone calorimeter test of two kinds of materials: (i) pinewood (charring) and (ii) low-density polyethylene (non-charring). Using a cone calorimeter setup, good agreement has been achieved between the computational and the experimental results. The model is capable of predicting the formation of the char layer and thus replicating the flame suppressing thermal and barrier effects. Furthermore, with the application of detailed chemical kinetics, the fire model was able to aptly predict the generation of asphyxiant gas such as CO/CO 2 during the burning process. However, the pinewood experiments showed significant CO/CO 2 emissions post flame extinguishment attributed to char oxidation effects, which were not considered by the fire model. Despite the limitation, the fully coupled LES model proposed in this study was capable of predicting the fluid mechanics and heat transfer for the turbulent reacting flow, solid-phase decomposition, and gaseous products under flaming conditions. In the future, it can be further extended to include char oxidation mechanisms to improve predictions for charring materials.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

However, traditional sequential convex optimization algorithms suffer from shortcomings in terms of their poor real-time performance. This work focuses on applying the deep learning-based closed-loop guidance algorithm and error propagation analysis for powered landing, thereby significantly improving the real-time performance. First, a controller consisting of two deep neural networks is constructed to map the thrust direction and magnitude of the rocket according to the state variables. Thereafter, the analytical transition relationships between different uncertainty sources and the state propagation error in a single guidance period are analyzed by adopting linear covariance analysis. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed methods is verified via a comparison with the indirect method and Monte Carlo simulations. Compared with the traditional sequential convex optimization algorithm, our method reduces the computation time from 75 ms to less than 1 ms. Therefore, it shows potential for online applications.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

Given that there are several special advantages of space relative navigation using angles-only measurements from passive optical sensors, angles-only relative navigation is considered as one of the best potential approaches in the field of space relative navigation. However, angles-only relative navigation is well-known for its range observability problem. To overcome this observability problem, many studies have been conducted over the past decades. In this study, we present a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art space relative navigation based on angles-only measurements. The emphasis is on the observability problem and solutions to angles-only relative navigation, where the review of the solutions is categorized into four classes based on the intrinsic principle: complicated dynamics approach, multi-line of sight (multi-LOS) approach, sensor offset center-of-mass approach, and orbit maneuver approach. Then, the flight demonstration results of angles-only relative navigation in the two projects are briefly reviewed.

doi:10.1007/s42064-021-0127-8,en,Measuring the mechanical properties of small body regolith layers using a granular penetrometer,"['OriginalPaper', 'Research Article']","Small bodies in the solar system are known to be covered by a layer of loose unconsolidated soil composed of grains ranging from dusty sands to rugged boulders. Various geophysical processes have modified these regolith layers since their origin. Therefore, the landforms on regolith-blanketed surfaces hold vital clues for reconstructing the geological processes occurring on small bodies. However, the mechanical strength of small body regolith remains unclear, which is an important parameter for understanding its dynamic evolution. Furthermore, regolith mechanical properties are key factors for the design and operation of space missions that interact with small body surfaces. The granular penetrometer, which is an instrument that facilitates in situ mechanical characterization of surface/subsurface materials, has attracted significant attention. However, we still do not fully understand the penetration dynamics related to granular regolith, partially because of the experimental difficulties in measuring grain-scale responses under microgravity, particularly on the longer timescales of small body dynamics. In this study, we analyzed the slow intrusion of a locomotor into granular matter through large-scale numerical simulations based on a soft sphere discrete element model. We demonstrated that the resistance force of cohesionless regolith increases abruptly with penetration depth after contact and then transitions to a linear regime. The scale factor of the steady-state component is roughly proportional to the internal friction of the granular materials, which allows us to deduce the shear strength of planetary soils by measuring their force-depth relationships. When cohesion is included, due to the brittle behavior of cohesive materials, the resistance profile is characterized by a stationary state at a large penetration depth. The saturation resistance, which represents the failure threshold of granular materials, increases with the cohesion strength of the regolith. This positive correlation provides a reliable tool for measuring the tensile strength of granular regolith in small body touchdown missions.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

While voxel-based deep learning frameworks have been proposed for this segmentation task, their performance remains limited. In this study, we offer a two-step surface-based deep learning pipeline that achieves significantly better results. Our proposed model takes a surface model of an entire set of principal brain arteries containing aneurysms as input and returns aneurysm surfaces as output. A user first generates a surface model by manually specifying multiple thresholds for time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography images. The system then samples small surface fragments from the entire set of brain arteries and classifies the surface fragments according to whether aneurysms are present using a point-based deep learning network (PointNet++). Finally, the system applies surface segmentation (SO-Net) to surface fragments containing aneurysms. We conduct a direct comparison of the segmentation performance of our proposed surface-based framework and an existing voxel-based method by counting voxels: our framework achieves a much higher Dice similarity (72%) than the prior approach (46%).","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

However, a deeper understanding of bioelectrochemical reaction in electrodes is urgent to improve the cell performance towards practical applications. In this paper, a mathematical model of air cathode MFCs was proposed by coupling mass transport and charge conservation with bioelectrochemical/electrochemical reactions. The model was validated based on experimental results and further used to predict the performance of MFCs. The effect of mass transport including oxygen and substrate on electrode kinetics was studied based on the model. The results showed that enhancing mass transport in both anode and cathode remarkably facilitated the electrode current and hence the cell performance, and oxygen transfer in catalyst layer of cathode is the dominating factor limiting the cell performance. The proposed model can provide a facile avenue to capture the interdependence of electrode variables and help guide electrode design for optimizing the performance of MFCs in practical applications.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

This paper aims to use edge-tailored guide vanes to ease flow transition and improve flow efficiency, numerically. Here, flow efficiency serves the purpose for qualifying the effectiveness of the proposed technology. Sensitivity studies were performed on the influence of number of guide vane and guide vane thickness in a 45° pipe elbow. In setting up the numerical model for the assumed two-phase flow system (crude oil and water), the volume of fluid model was activated to model time-dependent fluctuations of each interacting phase volume fraction throughout the flow period. Furthermore, the improved delayed detached-eddy simulation turbulence model is employed to resolve the flow features in and outside the wall boundary layer. From the findings, an improvement in flow performance was witnessed using guide vanes. Furthermore, three thin and non-contacting guide vanes were strategically positioned at the center and towards the circumference of the pipe within the bend area, causing an increase in flow efficiency by 78.87%. In addition, the guide vanes played a significant role in limiting turbulence effect to effective flow of the primary phase.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

doi:10.1007/s42757-021-0125-3,en,Towards the efficient modelling of trapped air pockets during squeeze flow,"['OriginalPaper', 'Research Article']","In most bonding processes, an adhesive is applied to a substrate in a specific pattern before the second substrate is subsequently pressed against it. During this, the adhesive flows in such a way that, ideally, it completely fills the joint. In practice, however, areas with entrapped air frequently remain in the bonded adhesive layer. Within the scope of a research project, these flows are systematically analyzed in order to identify optimal initial application patterns for the adhesive and substrate geometry to minimise such risks. For this purpose, the authors use an efficient flow model, the partially filled gaps model (PFGM), extended in this study to include the functionality of trapped air pockets. Depending on the volume fractions of air and adhesive, the flow of both phases is computed. Therefore, the model is introduced and fully described, benchmarked with respect to its plausibility and functionality, and results obtained are compared with a CFD calculation. Thereafter, the functionality of openings and closings of the pockets are analyzed. Lastly, the model is then applied to a real scenario created with a Hele–Shaw cell measurement.

Although suppression behaviours between hydrocarbon-fuelled fire and water-based suppression agents were extensively studied both numerically and experimentally, lack of numerical studies was conducted on fires involving water-reactive chemicals (i.e., Na, Li, and LiH), where extinguishment is barely performed by water-based active suppression system, as violent and explosive decomposition occurred between water and reactive fuel. In this research, a numerical investigation has been conducted on expandable graphite (EG) application for water-reactive fire suppression. Based on the discrete phase model (DPM) framework, a novel EG particle model is proposed to characterise the particle expansion that couples with superior thermal properties and chemical stability. A numerical assessment on large eddy simulation (LES) has been performed to study the temporal fire behaviours and the suppression effect of EG against the flame plume in various subgrid-scale (SGS) models. Four SGS models were adopted, which were namely Smagorinsky-Lilly, WALE, dynamic kinetic energy, and dynamic Smagorinsky-Lilly. As a result, the WALE SGS model was observed to be in a better agreement compared with the experimental data owing to its significant enhancement in flow diffusivity modelling. The WALE SGS model has achieved a more accurate temperature prediction and finer resolved turbulence compared with other SGS models.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

The novelty of the interface capturing method used here lies on the advection of level set which is solved with a WENO scheme and corrected with a novel re-initialisation method for retaining its signed distance function character. The coupling with the volume of fluid method is done with a simple algebraic approach, and with the new algorithm the accumulated mass conservation errors remain reasonably low. The paper presents a unique coupling between the level set method and the Eulerian–Lagrangian Spray Atomisation approach for modelling spray dispersion in liquid atomisation systems. The method is shown to have good accuracy providing similar results to other numerical codes for the classical tests presented. Preliminary results are also shown for three-dimensional simulations of the primary break-up of a turbulent liquid jet obtaining results comparable to direct numerical simulations. Consequently, the coupled method can be used for simulating various two-phase flow applications offering an accurate representation of the interface dynamics.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

This may lead to overestimation of the CO 2 emissions from SOC decomposition. In calcareous soils, there is a chemical balance between precipitation and dissolution of CaCO 3 -CO 2 -HCO 3 − , which is affected by soil environmental factors (moisture, temperature, pH and depth), root growth (rhizosphere effect) and agricultural measures (organic materials input, nitrogen fertilization and straw removal). In this paper, we first introduced the contribution of SIC dissolution to CO 2 emissions from calcareous soils and their driving factors. Second, we reviewed the methods to distinguish two CO 2 sources released from calcareous soils and quantify the 13 C fractionation coefficient between SIC and SIC-derived CO 2 and between SOC and SOC-derived CO 2 , and to partition three CO 2 sources released from soils with plants and organic materials input. Finally, we proposed methods for accurately distinguishing three CO 2 sources released from calcareous soils. This review helps to improve the accuracy of soil C balance assessment in calcareous soils, and also proposes the direction of further investigations on SIC-derived CO 2 emissions responses to abiotic factors and agricultural measures.","['Environment', 'Soil Science & Conservation', 'Ecology']"

As a popular application, composition recommendation for a photo focusing on a specific subject has been ignored by recent deep-learning-based composition recommendation approaches. In this paper, we propose a subject-aware image composition recommendation method, SAC-Net, which takes an RGB image and a binary subject window mask as input, and returns good compositions as crops containing the subject. Our model first determines candidate scores for all possible coarse cropping windows. The crops with high candidate scores are selected and further refined by regressing their corner points to generate the output recommended cropping windows. The final scores of the refined crops are predicted by a final score regression module. Unlike existing methods that need to preset several cropping windows, our network is able to automatically regress cropping windows with arbitrary aspect ratios and sizes. We propose novel stability losses for maximizing smoothness when changing cropping windows along with view changes. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods not only on the subject-aware image composition recommendation task, but also for general purpose composition recommendation. We also have designed a multistage labeling scheme so that a large amount of ranked pairs can be produced economically.

The proposed framework consists of an expert module focusing on scenes analysis, a CV module for automatic detection, an evaluation module containing thresholds, and an output module for data analysis. Based on this, the changes in the adoption of different CBR technologies (CBRTs), including light-translucent CBRTs (LT-CBRTs) and non-light-translucent CBRTs (NLT-CBRTs), in 24 villages in southern Hebei were identified from 2007 to 2021.

However, the FMP-MR energy dissipation mechanism is not fully understood owing to its disordered grid interpenetrating structure. In this work, computer-aided preparation technology is used to accurately reconstruct the complex spiral network structure of FMP-MR multipoint random contact, and a cell group model with an energy dissipation mechanism is proposed to obtain the dynamic energy distribution of the contact friction in both space and time dimensions. By judging the effective contact point, a global displacement ablation phenomenon of hooked staggered porous materials is induced. The macro- and micro-equivalent frictions are introduced to effectively explain the characteristics of the strong energy dissipation in FMP-MR under fretting excitation. A real and effective damping hysteresis constitutive model is then constructed to dynamically capture the mapping relationship between the complex nonlinear topological structure effect of the materials and spatial random contact dry friction in real time. The results indicate that the contact behavior between turns of the FMP-MR wire follows a clear quasi-Gaussian distribution under an external load, forcing the topological results to change. The energy dissipation of the materials revealed peak energy consumption lagging behind the loading limit for a certain distance, which can be determined by the effective contact point and contact dry friction slip. The consistency between the quasi-static compression tests and constitutive curves of the model was quantitatively verified through residual analysis. The data demonstrated the differential behavior of the FMP-MR meso-structure to follow a phased growth law during loading with different action mechanisms in the guiding, main growth, and relaxation stages of the energy consumption displacement curve. In summary, these findings provide an acceptable theoretical basis for the damping energy consumption mechanism and lifetime prediction of FMP-MR.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

The target space was split into several subzones based on the minimum controllable air terminal units in the proposed method, and each zone can be controlled to its own set-point while considering the thermal coupling effect from its adjacent zones. A numerical method resorting to computational fluid dynamics was presented to obtain the heat transfer coefficients (HTCs) under different air supply scenarios. The relationship between heat transfer coefficient and zonal temperature difference was linearized. Thus, currently available zonal models in popular software can be used to simulate the dynamic response of temperatures in large-scale indoor open spaces. Case studies showed that the introduction of HTCs across the adjacent zones was capable of enhancing the precision of temperature control of large-scale open spaces.

Using a validated computational fluid dynamics model, this study investigates the potential of various vegetative barriers or shelterbelts in attenuating the high wind speeds encountered in such spaces and the impact on wind and thermal comfort. Three skygarden configurations were investigated with and without vegetative barriers, simplified and modelled as porous zones, and their effect was studied on the velocity and temperature profile at the occupants’ level. The results indicate that while hedges and trees can offer resistance to airflow, trees provide higher temperature reduction. However, a combination of vegetative and geometrical barriers provides the most optimal condition in the skygarden. The study has identified the importance of assessing wind attenuation characteristics of tree plantations on highrise skygarden, and the results can be used in designing intervention strategies. Moreover, vegetation can attenuate pollutants and mitigate poor air quality by surface deposition, and future studies should investigate in that direction.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"
doi:10.1007/s12273-022-0935-7,en,Validation of virtual sensor-assisted Bayesian inference-based in-situ sensor calibration strategy for building HVAC systems,"['OriginalPaper', 'Research Article']","For building heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems (HVACs), sensor faults significantly affect the operation and control. Sensors with accurate and reliable measurements are critical for ensuring the precise indoor thermal demand. Owing to its high calibration accuracy and in-situ effectiveness, a virtual sensor (VS)-assisted Bayesian inference (VS-BI) sensor calibration strategy has been applied for HVACs. However, the application feasibility of this strategy for wider ranges of different sensor types (within-control-loop and out-of-control-loop) with various sensor bias fault amplitudes, and influencing factors that affect the practical in-situ calibration performance are still remained to be explored. Hence, to further validate its in-situ calibration performance and analyze the influencing factors, this study applied the VS-BI strategy in a HVAC system including a chiller plant with air handle unit (AHU) terminal. Three target sensors including air supply (SAT), chilled water supply (CHS) and cooling water return (CWR) temperatures are investigated using introduced sensor bias faults with eight different amplitudes of [−2 °C, +2 °C] with a 0.5 °C interval. Calibration performance is evaluated by considering three influencing factors: (1) performance of different data-driven VSs, (2) the influence of prior standard deviations σ on in-situ sensor calibration and (3) the influence of data quality on in-situ sensor calibration from the perspective of energy conservation and data volumes. After comparison, a long short term memory (LSTM) is adopted for VS construction with determination coefficient R -squared of 0.984. Results indicate that σ has almost no impact on calibration accuracy of CHS but scanty impact on that of SAT and CWR. The potential of using a prior standard deviation σ to improve the calibration accuracy is limited, only 8.61% on average. For system within-control-loop sensors like SAT and CHS, VS-BI obtains relatively high in-situ sensor calibration accuracy if the data quality is relatively high.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"
doi:10.1007/s00376-022-1445-3,en,A New Sensitivity Analysis Approach Using Conditional Nonlinear Optimal Perturbations and Its Preliminary Application,"['OriginalPaper', 'Original Paper']","Simulations and predictions using numerical models show considerable uncertainties, and parameter uncertainty is one of the most important sources. It is impractical to improve the simulation and prediction abilities by reducing the uncertainties of all parameters. Therefore, identifying the sensitive parameters or parameter combinations is crucial. This study proposes a novel approach: conditional nonlinear optimal perturbations sensitivity analysis (CNOPSA) method. The CNOPSA method fully considers the nonlinear synergistic effects of parameters in the whole parameter space and quantitatively estimates the maximum effects of parameter uncertainties, prone to extreme events. Results of the analytical g-function test indicate that the CNOPSA method can effectively identify the sensitivity of variables. Numerical results of the theoretical five-variable grassland ecosystem model show that the maximum influence of the simulated wilted biomass caused by parameter uncertainty can be estimated and computed by employing the CNOPSA method. The identified sensitive parameters can easily change the simulation or prediction of the wilted biomass, which affects the transformation of the grassland state in the grassland ecosystem. The variance-based approach may underestimate the parameter sensitivity because it only considers the influence of limited parameter samples from a statistical view. This study verifies that the CNOPSA method is effective and feasible for exploring the important and sensitive physical parameters or parameter combinations in numerical models. 数值模式中物理参数的不确定性是数值模拟和预测不确定性的重要来源之一。由于数值模式中包含大量的物理过程和参数，通过减少所有物理参数的不确定性以提高数值模式的模拟能力和预测技巧将花费大量的人力和物力。因此，识别敏感的参数或参数组合至关重要。本研究提出了一种识别物理参数敏感性的新方法：条件非线性最优扰动敏感性分析（CNOPSA）方法。该方法克服了传统方法的局限性，在参数不确定性范围内充分考虑了物理参数间的非线性协同效应，可识别出相对敏感和重要的物理参数和参数组合，并定量估计出由物理参数变化导致的数值模拟和预测不确定性的最大程度，因而适用于对极端事件的研究。 利用理论的g-函数和五变量草原生态系统模型检验了CNOPSA方法的可行性和有效性，结果表明CNOPSA方法可以有效地识别物理变量和物理参数的敏感性。本文进一步利用该方法，定量地估计了由物理参数不确定性导致的该草原生态系统模型中枯草量模拟和预测不确定性的最大程度，识别出的敏感参数的变化易使得草原生态系统发生突变。然而，基于方差分析的参数敏感性分析方法，仅从统计的角度考虑有限的参数样本，易低估物理参数的敏感性。","['Earth Sciences', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Meteorology', 'Geophysics/Geodesy']"

Recent FFM measurements on a NaCl crystal immersed in liquid (ethanol) surroundings displayed an increase of the effective contact stiffness, K eff , with the applied load, differently from similar measurements performed under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, where K eff showed negligible load dependency. Additionally, under UHV conditions multiple slip length friction with increasing load was reported, while in ethanol surroundings only single (lattice unit length) slips were observed. Our current understanding of this behavior relates the transition from single jumps to multiple jumps dynamics to the normal load (manifested through the amplitude of the interaction potential at the contact, U 0 ) and to the damping of the system. Here we have incorporated the effect of the load dependency on both U 0 and K eff within Prandtl—Tomlinson based simulations, accompanied by variations in the damping coefficient of the system. Introducing the experimentally observed load dependency to K eff resulted indeed in single slip jumps at critical damping, while multiple slip jumps were obtained at constant K eff . The average slip length increased with the normal load, particularly when the system became underdamped. Our work provides a glimpse on the relation between the characteristic observables in atomic-scale sliding friction (maximal slip forces, stiffness, and slip dynamics) with respect to their governing parameters (corrugation energy, effective stiffness, and damping). While common understanding in nanotribology relates the effect of surrounding media mainly to the interaction potential at the contact, here we show that the media can also greatly affect the elastic interaction, and consequently play an important role on the transition from single to multiple stick-slip.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

They are composed of ferromagnetic particles, surfactants, and base liquids. The main characteristics of ferrofluids include magnetization, the magnetoviscous effect, and levitation characteristics. There are many mature commercial ferrofluid damping applications based on these characteristics that are widely used in numerous fields. Furthermore, some ferrofluid damping studies such as those related to vibration energy harvesters and biomedical devices are still in the laboratory stage. This review paper summarizes typical ferrofluid dampers and energy harvesting systems from the 1960s to the present, including ferrofluid viscous dampers, ferrofluid inertia dampers, tuned magnetic fluid dampers (TMFDs), and vibration energy harvesters. In particular, it focuses on TMFDs and vibration energy harvesters because they have been the hottest research topics in the ferrofluid damping field in recent years. This review also proposes a novel magnetic fluid damper that achieves energy conversion and improves the efficiency of vibration attenuation.

The oil starvation in and around the contacts is harmful to the performance and fatigue life of rolling bearings. Therefore, it is of necessity to understand the behaviors of oil transfer and the patterns of air-oil two-phase flow in bearings, especially with the influence of different capillary properties. This work established a transient air-oil two-phase flow model in a ball bearing based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Groups of cases are implemented to investigate the behaviors of oil transfer and air-oil flow under different capillary conditions with speed, surface tension, and viscosity. Flow patterns are classified by the morphological features of the air-oil flow. Staged phenomena are analyzed with flow patterns and reach good agreements with the observations from experiments. It is found that the oil distribution and air-oil flow behaviors in a ball bearing are strongly related to the speed and the ratio of oil viscosity and air-oil surface tension ( μ oil / σ ). The flow maps imply that the levels of capillary number (Ca) may be the boundaries and the critical points of flow pattern transition between the different flow patterns in bearing.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"
doi:10.1007/s12273-022-0933-9,en,A demand side management approach to increase self-consumption in buildings,"['OriginalPaper', 'Research Article']","There is a growing interest in increasing the presence of renewable energy in the electric network. Photovoltaic production from grid-connected systems is leading this growth in terms of households. Alongside this development, concern about network security has emerged, because excesses of intermittent renewable energy on the grid could exceed voltage limits. Self-consumption, understood as the capacity of the producer to consume his or her own production, can partially solve these problems. Thermostatic controllable loads, such as heating and cooling, represent 50% of the total amount of energy consumed by buildings; the proper allocation of these loads could be a driving force for self-consumption. In this study, a demand side management strategy is proposed based on a building energy model equipped with an inverter heat pump coupled with a photovoltaic plant. The goal is to maximize the use of local energy from the photovoltaic plant (self-consumption), reducing the export and import of energy to and from the grid. This goal is achieved by optimizing the set-points in each room. An array of optimal set-points over six years is presented. The results show the capacity of the methodology to match similar values of self-consumption (70% in winter and 50% in summer) obtained by strategies based on chemical batteries. The findings are shown in an energy matching chart at different levels of detail (yearly and monthly). Color bubbles are added to the matching chart to help visualize the unmatched energy of the system graphically. In comparison with actual model predictive control technologies, this study’s strategy offers great simplicity and a large saving in computational time.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"

Several mechanisms have been proposed for explaining its occurrence and quantifying its frequencies, notably for automotive brake squeal, clutch squeal, and even rail corrugation. However, due to the complex and complicated nature of FIVN, there is not yet one fundamental mechanism that can explain all phenomena of FIVN. Based on experimental results obtained on a simple test structure and corresponding numerical validation using both complex eigenvalue analysis (CEA) and transient dynamic analysis (TDA), this study attempts to propose a new fundamental mechanism for FIVN, which is the repeated cycles of partial detachment and then reattachment of the contact surfaces. Since friction is ubiquitous and FIVN is very common, the insight into FIVN reported in this paper is highly significant and will help establish effective means to control FIVN in engineering and daily life.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

The results show that the dendrites growth zones (DGZs) and needles growth zones (NGZs) mostly contain dendrites (DN) and needles (NE), respectively. Clear σ v zones (1.1 < σ v (m s −1 ) < 1.3 and 0.3 < σ v (m s −1 ) < 0.7 for the DGZ and NGZ, respectively) could be identified in the case studies (27 and 28 February 2016) near altitudes corresponding to temperatures of −15°C and −5°C, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency and mesoscale model reanalysis data. Oblate particles with diverse particle shapes were observed in the DGZ with σ V > 1.2 m s −1 , a differential reflectivity (Z DR ) higher than 0 dB, and a cross-correlation coefficient ( ρ hv ) less than 0.96. In contrast, prolate particles with relatively uniform shapes were observed in the NGZ with σ v < 0.6 m s −1 , a Z DR less than 0 dB, and ρ hv higher than 0.97. The simulation results show that the DN exhibited a larger σ v compared to the NE, and this observed σ v was strongly dependent on the wind fluctuations ( v ’) due to turbulence or wind shear. In contrast, the NE exhibited a significantly small σ v ∼ 0.55 m s −1 , which converges irrespective of v ’. In addition, a strong correlation between the measured σ v values at five radar elevation angles ( θ = 6.2°, 9.1°, 13.1°, 19°, and 80°) and those simulated in this study confirmed the significance of the analysis results. 本文研究了模拟和实测雷达速度谱宽之间的相关性。结果表明,枝状固态水凝物增长区（DGZs）和针状固态水凝物增长区（NGZs）主要分别含有枝状冰晶（DN）和针状冰晶（NE）。 根据日本气象厅和中尺度模式再分析数据,在与-15°C和-5°C温度相对应的高度附近案例（2016年2月27日和28日）的研究中,雷达速度谱宽区（DGZ的雷达速度谱宽范围是1.1 m s –1 至 1.3 m s –1 ,NGZ的雷达速度谱宽范围是0.3 m s –1 至 0.7 m s –1 ）可以被清晰地识别出来。在DGZ中观察到具有不同颗粒形状的扁椭球粒子,其雷达速度谱宽大于1.2 m s –1 ,差分反射率高于0 dB,互相关系数小于0.96。相比之下,在NGZ中,观察到具有相对均匀形状的长椭球粒子,其雷达速度谱宽小于0.6 m s –1 ,差分反射率小于0 dB,互相关系数高于0.97。 模拟结果表明,与NE相比,DN对应着更大的雷达速度谱宽,并且观测到的雷达速度谱宽强烈依赖于湍流或风切变引起的风波动。相比之下,NE表现出明显较小的雷达速度谱宽~ 0.55 m s –1 ,其收敛与风波动无关。此外,在五个雷达仰角（θ=6.2°、9.1°、13.1°、19°和80°）下测得的雷达速度谱宽值与本研究中模拟得到的雷达速度谱宽值之间表现出一种强相关性,印证了分析结果的重要性。","['Earth Sciences', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Meteorology', 'Geophysics/Geodesy']"

Even more unusual is the path they take in their conversation. Seemingly by chance, they discuss the traits of an ideal society while investigating the divine origin of human law. Why does Agostini arrive at the description of his utopia through this peculiar route? Why does he not follow the examples of Greco-Roman (i.e., Aristotle, Cicero, and Plato) and Renaissance (Brucioli) authors who, right from the start of their investigations, introduced the debate on an ideal society? What is the connection between the study of the divine origin of human laws and the portrayal of utopia?

The law codes of the Enlightenment restrained to different degrees married women’s autonomy to function as independent persons in the law and in consequence in society. They worked as a barrier besides the exclusion from political especially suffrage rights to rule women out from equal citizenship rights. It is not surprising that women started to protest against their experience of discrimination in law and tried to use it in turn as a motor for change. Family law is decisive for women’s rights as it was here, where they had been restricted in the hardest possible way even in relationship to their own children. The struggles in the different European countries for equal laws in the family were remarkably similar in their historic patterns and in their connectedness to the efforts for women’s advancement. It is astonishing how much the legal discrimination against women across legal families and nations is part of all legal systems. It belongs to the basic conditions of the state orders of Europe, without this continuing to be perceived and described outside the history of women and as the basis of the political order of Europe.","['Law', 'Theories of Law, Philosophy of Law, Legal History', 'Gender Studies']"

It underscores how the relationship between memory and law can be considered on the basis of law as a product of memory, rather than memory as an effect or object of law. The argument that this chapter makes is that understandings of and receptiveness to state laws is substantiated in behaviours which are grounded in a reliance on particular mnemohistorical narratives of a collective past. In order to make this argument, this chapter considers both the social significance of collective memory and how law can be thought of as a product of a plurality of distributed institutions, actors, and ideologies. In this context, memory’s social significance can be established on the basis that it is one among many contributors to a plural conception of law. This chapter sets this out by identifying how memory informs juridically significant notions of belonging and recognition. Equally, it identifies memory as being involved in situational legal meaning-making and in legal socialization processes.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Socio-legal Studies', 'Memory Studies', 'Theories of Law, Philosophy of Law, Legal History', 'Political Science', 'Political Sociology', 'Sociology of Culture']"

In 2015, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlighted that the Earth’s climate system has consistently been warming since the 1950s and that a “large fraction of anthropogenic climate change resulting from CO 2 emissions is irreversible on a multi-century to millennial time scale, except in the case of a large net removal of CO 2 from the atmosphere over a sustained period”. Initial responses to climate change revolved around States attempting to reduce, rather than remove, greenhouse gas emissions. However, as the global economy expands, greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise and cooperative arrangements aimed at reducing emissions have had limited, if any, impact. If recent predictions are to be believed, the remaining “carbon budget” needed to prevent average global temperatures from increasing by more than 1.5 °C may be exhausted by 2030. Climate Analytics estimates that the current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) made by States under the Paris Agreement indicate that average global temperatures will rise by 2.8 °C by 2100—almost double the stipulated efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels mentioned in Article 2(1)(a) of the Paris Agreement. The recent IPCC Special Report on 1.5 °C Global Warming concludes that without “increased and urgent mitigation ambition in the coming years, leading to a sharp decline in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, global warming will [cause] irreversible loss of the most fragile ecosystems and crisis after crisis for the most vulnerable people and societies”.","['Law', 'International Environmental Law', 'Environmental Economics']"

These critics demand international law to be more inclusive towards non-European knowledge, inter alia Islamic law. Some scholars have argued that it is essential for the ICC to refer to Islamic law, not only to counter Eurocentrism in general but also because of the growing number of cases involving Muslims. Other scholars have suggested that there is some congruence between Islamic law and international criminal law in some general principles. However, so far there is very little comprehensive analysis on the compatibility of the two. It must be noted that if Islamic law has prescribed criminalization for international crimes up to a standard which is at least on par with what international law requires, this would mean at least that (a) there would be no reason for the ICC to not refer to Islamic law resources, and (b) Muslim states/groups who implement it would not need to refer cases to the ICC due to the complementarity principle. This research comparatively analyses Islamic Law and the ICC Statute. For the former, this research uses the fiqh literature of the traditionalist Islamic law scholars. Further, this research limits itself to war crimes included in Article 8 of the ICC Statute, specifically crimes against civilians. The hypothesis is that there is congruence in some but not in all rules, which is a challenge for international law and Islamic law scholars likewise.","['Law', 'International Criminal Law', 'Public International Law', 'Human Rights', 'Sources and Subjects of International Law, International Organizations']"

A TWAIL Perspective on Some Arenas of Contestations,OriginalPaper,"The construction of contemporary international criminal justice seems to have followed a trajectory defined by the inescapable colonial origin, history and purpose of modern international law. Notwithstanding the professed successes and progress made towards the establishment of a universal standard or notion of justice, Post-World War II international criminal justice remains an essentially imperial ideal intolerant of a plurality of visions of justice and whose resistance and legitimacy in the Global South is often obfuscated by media representation. In this chapter, I identify four arenas of contestations in this regard and examine each of them to demonstrate that international criminal justice has not shed its historical antecedents that characterised its previous manifestations in previous eras. These arenas of contestations—the supposed universality of legal norms of international criminal justice; the alleged inherent selectivity of international criminal justice in the prosecution of perpetrators; the categories of crimes; and the establishment of its foremost institutions for its enforcement. The chapter will adopt TWAIL as an analytical framework to expose the manifest contradictions in the construction of international criminal justice and some of the legal problems thereby created. I argue that international criminal justice remains a tool in the service of hegemonic international law.","['Law', 'International Criminal Law', 'Public International Law', 'Human Rights', 'Sources and Subjects of International Law, International Organizations']"

In today’s China, this code cannot be understood, interpreted, and implemented correctly without taking into consideration the continued application of these two ancient Chinese legal philosophies. Various ethical norms and key socialist values are incorporated into this code. The protection of state and collective interests prevails overwhelmingly over that of individual interests, even though the equal protection between private, collective and state ownership is expressly recognized in law in book. Private autonomy is strongly restricted and limited by public authority. The traditional legalist way of governing the state, characterized by the combined application of law, political power and secret skill of ruling, is also adopted by the Chinese legislature in the drafting and implementation of this code. Due to the massive application of judicial interpretations of the Supreme Court, guiding opinions of high courts and the policies of the ruling party, in terms of law in action, today’s Chinese civil law has already been decodified.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Civil Law', 'Fundamentals of Law']"

Indeed, the Spanish Civil Code mainly reflected the law of Castille and respected territorial laws in force in other parts of the country. Later, within the framework of the plurality of civil legislation that was recognized in the Spanish Constitution, Catalonia (and other territories) gradually developed their competence in civil matters. On occasions, this has made it possible to overcome the passivity of the state legislator in regard to dealing with the lack of modern reforms in the CC. A civil code imposes rationality and legal security and provides the opportunity to craft law tailored to the particular needs and interests of the society for which the civil code is intended. Beyond juridical incentives, there are also political motivations behind codification. Beyond serving as a symbol of the Catalan nation and strengthening its own personality, today the reasons for a Civil Code for Catalonia are better understood when considering the importance of civil law in regulating relations between citizens in a rapidly changing modern age.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Civil Law', 'Fundamentals of Law']"

However, the Convention of the Rights of the Child (CRC), which is the most ratified human rights instrument, is dedicated to children’s rights and is unique in specifically referring to the dangers and risks of environmental pollution. This chapter will propose a critical analysis of the normative basis underlying the articulation of environment-related rights Environment-related rights for children. After clarifying the notion of child and the point at which childhood can be said to begin, it will first consider conventional provisions containing explicit references to the environment and then discuss other provisions that indirectly protect environmental aspects of children’s rights. It will also address the Convention’s general guiding principles Guiding principles , which show that the drafters were aware of the long-term impact Impacts of environmental pollution and its intergenerational Intergenerational implications, for safeguarding the present generation Generation present is a pledge towards the protection of future generations Generation future . Finally, attention will be turned to ways in which the content and scope of the Convention’s express and implied rights and principles are being and can be expanded, notably through the proactive stance taken by the Convention’s monitoring body, the Committee on the Rights of the Child.

The pronounced goals were to adapt the Civil Code to economic and social changes since its codification at the end of the nineteenth century and to make the Code easier for the general public to understand. However, the amendments made are mostly of a technical nature, making the reform a “triumph of legal technocrats.” Most of the innovative proposals were rejected, and academics are already talking about the possibility of developing interpretations of the adopted text with reference to rejected proposals as guidance. The omission of policy issues from the Code and the large role expected of lawyers and courts in driving interpretative developments are typical of how the law has evolved in Japan.

Given the consensus-based decision-making method that informs the entire structure of IOSCO, the Member chairing a committee enjoys the advantage of channeling the discussion and perceiving “the sense of the room”. The chapter discovers and lists those jurisdictions that have held the chairs of the Organization’s governing bodies and working groups as a method to measure their ‘activism’ within IOSCO.

It concludes that while the CCC has generally adopted a logical macro structure akin to the BGB, a number of problems currently exist at a micro level, which severely diminishes the systematization of the Code. Inconsistency between different provisions, repetition, inadequate use of cross-referencing, and the overly broadness of some provisions have been identified as the major problems in this regard. The uneasy relationship between provisions governing obligations in general and provisions governing contracts only within Title 1 of Book III Contracts also poses a potential challenge. By identifying and analyzing these problems, the present chapter hopes to contribute to their future solution by way of legislative amendments and judicial interpretations.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Civil Law', 'Fundamentals of Law']"

The admissibility ratione personae requirement and the procedural rules established under the Rules of Court do not regulate the access to the Court for those victims who are not de jure and/or de facto capable of lodging applications. The Court is striving to fill such a procedural lacuna through the so-called “extreme vulnerability test”, by taking into account the victims’ incapacity and the seriousness of the alleged violations. In those cases, provided that several other conditions are fulfilled, NGOs are allowed to apply on behalf of extremely vulnerable victims, in their capacity as “ de facto representatives”. The Court’s approach, however, is grounded on the (alleged) exceptional circumstances of each specific case and does not guarantee predictability and legal certainty. Moreover, some of the conditions (in particular, the recognition of the alleged de facto representative’s locus standi in the domestic proceedings coupled with the need for direct contact between the victim and the representative) appear unjustified and raise issues of conformity with the ECtHR’s case-law. The present chapter examines the Court’s approach and proposes some interpretative correctives in the light of the principle of substantive equality in the access to (international) justice, also with the aim of harmonizing the ECHR system with other universal and regional human rights systems.","['Law', 'Public International Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'European Law', 'Human Rights', 'Dispute Resolution, Mediation, Arbitration', 'International Criminal Law']"

At the beginning of the unitary State, the latter claimed a monopoly on law making, and its laws became the only formal source of law. The next codification, the Dutch Civil Code of 1838, which was the product of the beliefs of the bourgeoisie class, led to a formalistic attitude of the courts and legal doctrine. Only in the early twentieth century did the primacy of law formation slowly shift from the legislature to the courts. Then, it became clear that the Dutch civil law codification was not unique and complete. However, law making by judges led to a lack of uniformity and legal certainty. A drafting process that started in 1947 led to a new Civil Code in 1992, which codified previous case law and solved the remaining lacunae and technical ambiguities. This code did not, however, have a constitutional, unifying role, nor did it lead to a fundamental change in practice. Due to its corrective mechanisms, such as open norms, future developments can be more easily dealt with, and courts are given free leeway in law making. Although this Civil Code is still the cornerstone of private law, actual law making, at least in tort law, is largely performed by the courts. The Code lacks the element of exclusiveness or completeness. In the long run, it is a question whether a national codification is the best way forward.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Civil Law', 'Fundamentals of Law']"

While the traditional approach of arbitral tribunals has upheld a strict limitation of the opportunity to present counterclaims, respondent States have recently intensified their attempts to avail themselves of such remedies in investment arbitration. The prospective trend in the arbitral case law may accommodate more liberal solutions as to the practicability for sovereigns to enforce investor’s commitments at the international level vis-à-vis the domestic level of court litigation, also and decisively due to the insertion in international investment agreements of innovative substantive provisions establishing obligations also upon foreign entrepreneurs. Such solutions are analysed herein under the jurisdictional, admissibility and merits perspective. Interestingly, the study of counterclaims by States in treaty-based investment arbitration, which involves procedural as well as substantive issues, seems to be currently embedded in the broader phenomena of the advancement of the “business and human rights movement”. To this extent, investor-State dispute settlement may constitute a viable international arena for the enforcement of human rights related claims.","['Law', 'Public International Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'European Law', 'Human Rights', 'Dispute Resolution, Mediation, Arbitration', 'International Criminal Law']"

Initially, an attempt was made to adopt the draft changes in their entirety, but it was met with fierce resistance from the legal community. As a result, the process of making changes to the Civil Code is still incomplete. In particular, the changes affected the law of obligations and contract law. However, important innovations took place in inheritance law and in a number of other sections of civil law. The proposed comprehensive reform of property law has thus far failed due to the obvious imperfection of the draft amendments, which, however, does not exclude that the legislator will return to this issue in the future.

However, in 2016, the Minister of Justice Koen Geens communicated a large-scale recodification program, including a new Civil Code. The code was planned to consist of nine books in an order determined by pragmatic—not doctrinal—considerations without a common method for editing the parts of the code. By 1 November 2020, Book 8 had already entered into force, and Parliament had already approved Book 3, with Books 4 and 5 and a part of Book 2 already being submitted to it. Among the factors explaining this success are the pragmatism and flexibility of the drafting process, the lack of truly revolutionary reforms and the enthusiasm for a new code that Minister Geens generated among law professors and politicians. Thus far, the drafters of the code have not yet dealt with some controversial issues of family law, so that some of the hardest work is still ahead of them. However, there is no doubt that almost two hundred years after independence, Belgium has finally emancipated its private law from France.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Civil Law', 'Fundamentals of Law']"

The term gender is now part of our vocabulary and globally incorporated in media, academy, law, politics, and society in general. Gender perspective, gender mainstreaming, gender identity, gender and law are now common terms. However, do we know what we refer to when using the term gender? Frequently, simple questions like, What is your gender? or What is your sex? can be difficult to answer when we realize that the term gender is used in the same context as sex to refer to male and female or masculine and feminine. Gender can also be used to refer to sexual harassment, social sex, cultural oppression, and even as a synonym for woman. Furthermore, for some, gender is a binary, while for others, it reflects fluidity and diversity. These various approaches to the concept of gender appear to complicate its use in law which prefers established normative factual concepts. Therefore, what is the meaning of gender in law? Avoiding the misleading use of gender requires shedding some light on the concept and term and its development within feminism and in law.","['Law', 'Theories of Law, Philosophy of Law, Legal History', 'Gender Studies']"

Law’s contributions must therefore reflect awareness of and complement the insights from other relevant disciplines. This makes law’s contribution to sustainability research inherently interdisciplinary. Yet many legal scholars continue to regard interdisciplinary research as possibly beyond their competence, both in terms of substantive knowledge and in terms of designing, explaining and justifying their methodology. This chapter takes a reflective practice approach to reviewing the author’s own experiences engaging in interdisciplinary legal research. It first briefly reviews the theoretical literature addressing the issues that may arise when attempting interdisciplinary research in law. It then turns to the author’s experiences, applying the theory to the author’s foray into interdisciplinary legal research. It describes both the pitfalls and the benefits of engaging in interdisciplinary research that the author has encountered. Ultimately, the chapter is intended to encourage additional interdisciplinary research projects in law. It is hoped that the author’s reflections on her own experience may help sustainability researchers and others as they design their own projects.","['Business and Management', 'Sustainability Management', 'Economic Geography', 'Diversity Management/Women in Business', 'Law and Economics', 'Business Ethics']"

However, this is a fairly recent development. Through the greater part of mankind’s history, adultery was a crime—one that frequently only women could commit. A man could be punished for being an unfaithful wife’s lover, but not for cheating on his own wife. Even when male adultery was prescribed as an option as well, discrimination was still present: more restrictive conditions were prescribed for a man’s act to be classified as adultery, or punishment was less severe, or seemingly egalitarian rules were interpreted in practice so as to favour men over women. As the fight for women’s rights reached the regulations against adultery, the reforms went not in the direction of equal regulation, but rather of complete decriminalization of adultery. This paper gives a brief overview of the regulations against adultery since Antiquity to the present. Various factors are analyzed, such as the degree of gender (in)equality in regulations against adultery, the prescribed penalties, the influence of religion, the possibility of the justifiable homicide of adulterers.","['Law', 'Theories of Law, Philosophy of Law, Legal History', 'Gender Studies']"

In other words, it was one of the most significant steps taken toward the modernization of Turkish society. The new Turkish State departed from its religious foundation and instead was built on secularism. These laws laid the blueprints for a new society by reconstituting the basis of private law through the introduction of new regulations in the laws of persons, inheritance, property, and family. Two major difficulties were encountered during the process of adopting this Civil Code. The first major difficulty was inherent in translation, initially arising from their translation and further complicated by the Turkish language reform in the 1930s. The second major difficulty was the resistance that the new Civil Code received as a result of its radical changes in the regulation of family law. However, we argue that Turkish society, which has a culture of its own, has over time adapted itself to these new laws. Therefore, a significant conclusion that can be drawn from the modernization process in Turkey is that civil law rules can be successfully adopted by a country even when they come from different cultures and societies.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Civil Law', 'Fundamentals of Law']"

To this end, it is structured into two main sections. The first one deals with the functioning of the concept of equality in inter-state relations, by describing the transition from the “classical” international law idea of “sovereign equality” to the attempts to draft international instruments aimed at “compensating inequalities”. The second one, moving on from the assumption that the EU is a Union of states and citizens, inquires into the nature of equality in this peculiar supranational system, by investigating the implementation of this principle in both Member States relations and towards individuals. The latter analysis reveals a nuanced approach to equality by European institutions, ranging from the CJEU’s “indifference towards difference” to the protection of the weaker party in EU private international law.","['Law', 'Public International Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'European Law', 'Human Rights', 'Dispute Resolution, Mediation, Arbitration', 'International Criminal Law']"

As a result, citizenship rights can only be enjoyed by those who can afford mobility. This contribution focusses on the personal scope of free movement of workers as the precedent of Union citizenship. The argument put forward is that the definition of worker, which constitutes the main demarcation line between economically active and inactive persons, is already marked by discrimination and arbitrariness in the identification of who is a worker under EU law. It is submitted that the establishment of Union citizenship has not solved these problems, since economic activity is still a deal breaker in the distribution of rights. Finally, this chapter argues that the inequalities that free movement of workers entails are intertwined with its double nature as economic freedom and a fundamental right and that this double nature should lead to questioning the very divide between economic activity and inactivity. Rethinking such a rift triggers questions as to the relationship between economic free movement and Union citizenship more generally.","['Law', 'Public International Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'European Law', 'Human Rights', 'Dispute Resolution, Mediation, Arbitration', 'International Criminal Law']"

In parallel to the CRC, because of the ‘at risk Risk ’ nature of children Children and infants, between the lines, a child-centred approach Child-centred approach is also perceptible and is justified in international and EU environmental law so that much of the multilateral legislation designed to address environmental issues ought to benefit the child as a distinct recipient.

This poses new challenges for private law. The need to contrast an irresponsible model of a consumer society with the necessity to understand nature as a nonnegotiable asset are responses to environmental problems that involve the new civil codes, including in particular those of Argentina and China. Focusing on the concepts of consumo sustentable and lüse yuanze from a comparative perspective, the author emphasizes the so-called “greening” of civil codes, stressing how these principles will not be effective in ensuring the survival of the geo-human system if not coordinated with constitution-based and democratic decision-making. New Latin American constitutions have fostered the elaboration, by legal scholars, of a new critical approach to environmental problems, which appears to be a valid starting point for facilitating the response of private law to ecological issues: that is to say, first of all, to introduce contractual and civil liability systems that will give priority to environmental problems.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Civil Law', 'Fundamentals of Law']"

According to the so-called ‘Brussels System’, such defendants are still subject to the residual application of Member States’ national rules on jurisdiction, including those which are normally considered as having an exorbitant reach. While these grounds of jurisdiction are seen as improper and unfair to such an extent that their use in intra-EU disputes is prohibited, they are nonetheless available when it comes to proceedings against non-EU-domiciled defendants. This gap seems problematic on the sides of both non-EU-domiciled defendants and EU-domiciled claimants, since it ends up generating unequal treatments in relation to foreseeability and access to justice. Against this background, some possible solutions will be therefore evaluated, also in the light of some recent developments at the international level.","['Law', 'Public International Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'European Law', 'Human Rights', 'Dispute Resolution, Mediation, Arbitration', 'International Criminal Law']"

But the doctrine of equality of States is not the only factor inspiring the Treaty provision. It is generally accepted that the wording of Article 4(2), echoing the definition of formal equality which is contained in the core international human rights instruments—as well as in the constitutions of States—, is also a clear expression of the strict nexus between States and individuals under EU law. Unsurprisingly, the respect of the equality of Member States is also intimately tied to the protection of fundamental values upon which the Union is based—starting from the respect of the rule of law—and thus contributes to the affirmation of the autonomy of EU law, as well as to the establishment of an idea of “mutual membership within the Union”, that is, the idea that unilateral actions of Member States are likely to have an influence on their mutual relations, even in situations where the linkage with EU law is less strict. Against this background, this chapter explores some recent elements of practice attributable to Member States of the Union, showing a growing recourse to a logic of unilateralism, with a view to assessing their implications for a proper enforcement of the equality principle. To do so, the chapter is structured into four sections. After a global assessment of the equality principle in EU law (Sect. 3.1 ), Sect. 3.2 looks at recent episodes of unilateral infringements of EU law put in place by some EU countries, justified by the need to protect national prerogatives, and creating tensions in terms of equality among Member States before the Treaties. Section 3.3 considers the judicial unilateralism showed recently by the supreme courts of some Member States in re-shaping the interplay between EU law and municipal law, and the influence of such unilateralism on the affirmation of the equality principle. Section 3.4 concludes the chapter, summarizing its main findings.","['Law', 'Public International Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'European Law', 'Human Rights', 'Dispute Resolution, Mediation, Arbitration', 'International Criminal Law']"

In the Brazilian case, to understand the process that resulted in a new Civil Code, it is necessary to know much about the elaboration of the 1916 Civil Code, as well as when and why there were demands to replace it eighty years later. After considering these aspects, this contribution examines the debates on whether the 2002 Civil Code is actually a new code, or just an update of the 1916 Civil Code, and to what extent the 2002 Civil Code can be considered a law capable of regulating the Brazilian society in the twenty-first century. In fact, due to the passage of time, the 2002 Civil Code corresponds to the 1916 Civil Code as updated until the 1970s. The real impact of this new Civil Code on the regulation of private relations is then analyzed, explaining the reasons why some important articles of the Code were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, and what should have been done for the Civil Code to be able to respond to the current expectations regarding its ability to regulate private relations.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Civil Law', 'Fundamentals of Law']"

Almost uniquely on the European continent, until 1959, private law in Hungary was mostly judge-made customary law. However, the first Code from 1959 was conceived and adopted in an era in which nationalization fully liquidated private property. Therefore, after 1990, a new codification was necessary. The new Hungarian CC, like the other codifications in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states from the last thirty years, belongs to the fourth generation of codification. These CCs were born in the course of the historically late reestablishment of the private property-based society. Although the privatization of the state property was implemented by separate statutes, the new codes, including the Hungarian CC from 2013, play an important social role, similar to the classical codes in the early nineteenth century.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Civil Law', 'Fundamentals of Law']"

The success of New Zealand’s Prostitution Reform Act [2003] in the brothel sector, however, depends upon sex workers and brothel operators understanding the provisions of the law and being willing and able to implement them. Drawing on interviews with brothel operators and brothel-based sex workers, this chapter investigates knowledge of the law along with the bureaucratic contexts associated with running brothels as ‘businesses like any other.’ Whilst decriminalisation offers the promise of alleviating the harmful effects of stigma, New Zealand’s brothel operators and sex workers nevertheless continue to experience marginalisation and discrimination.

This question is examined within the realm of externally assisted rule of law reform using the Central Asian region as a case study.

It then identifies some of the public-private tensions and risks of regulatory capture that arise from legal forms spurred by industry and the American neoliberal context in which certain reforms arrive within other nation states. In revisiting past debates and weak proposals in hybrid business law by parties seemingly committed to upholding the status quo, it is apparent that transdisciplinary understandings in law and business are needed to fully understand and grapple the existential social and environmental emergencies facing humanity.

In this chapter, I will consider the evolution of the law in Italy since the entry into force of the Italian civil code in 1942. Although the formal structures of the code have largely remained the same over the years, the case for a new codification is becoming compelling. In the eighty years since the enactment of the code, the country has witnessed the fall of fascism, the establishment of the Republic and the return to democracy, a rapid modernisation, and the consequent change of social values. Several areas of the law have therefore experienced profound transformations. European Union law and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights have also deeply influenced Italian law. The Republican Constitution has been a key factor in consolidating the evolution of the law. At present, there is little chance that Italy will soon introduce a new civil codification, but the Italian civil code of 1942 is now facing old age; the efforts to keep it up to date on the basis of a piecemeal approach to reform should probably give way to more ambitious plans for a new civil codification.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Civil Law', 'Fundamentals of Law']"

They are often discussed within broader debates about the merits of hate speech law, but this book places them front and centre to interrogate how they have been justified, contested and negotiated by the legislators who shaped them. This introductory chapter sets out the specifics of the offences, how they fit within domestic and international legal contexts, the curiosities that initiated the project and the methods adopted to pursue them. I introduce a novel approach of exploring myths within parliamentary discourse as a way of tracing how ideas about identity and order have persisted and evolved throughout the life of the offences.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Critical Criminology', 'Human Rights', 'Political Sociology', 'Socio-legal Studies', 'Public Law', 'Political Science']"

The consensus method informs the internal standard-making procedures. This means that a final deliberation is based on the “general understanding”, which represents the core regulatory compromise achieved by stakeholders. Here the Chair plays an important role, by setting the tone and guiding the discussions. Subsequently, the Chapter analyzes the issue of transparency and rights of participation, highlighting the current features and, to a certain extent, gaps. Finally, the focus shifts to accountability and legitimacy. While the latter mostly revolves around input legitimacy; the former is, at the same time, internal, upwards, mutual, and bottom-up and unfolds through a circle.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'European Law', 'International Economic Law, Trade Law']"

Recent studies suggest that these high incidence of homophobic prejudices in Nigerian schools is encouraged by the perpetuation of colonial messaging through coloniality of knowledge evidenced in what is taught or not taught in Nigerian classrooms as well as by local stakeholders perpetuating homophobia themselves. As such there is a gap for the decolonisation of Nigerian classrooms through the inclusion and engagement with Afro-queer sensitive and human rights grounded advocacy tools. It is important to note that Nigerian law criminalises not just queer expression but the support of queer persons. This paper makes the argument that the challenge of homophobia in Nigeria deserves as much legal agitation as it should focus on curbing negative attitudes. This study grounds itself in contact and imagined contact theory to argue that contact and simulated/imagined contact with queer persons can aid the eradication of homophobic prejudices. Intimacy and interaction through stories breed understanding, conversations and empathy. In advocating for the eradication of violence and stigma towards queer persons as provided in Resolution 275, this study suggests the incorporation of indigenous storytelling as a decolonial tool in Nigerian classrooms. These elements of indigenous storytelling, contact theory, imagined contact theory and attitude-focus of pedagogical approaches are embodied in the law and literature approach. With evidence from a recent empirically assessed storytelling intervention at the Niger Delta University, Nigeria, this study demonstrates the contributory effect of the law and literature approach, through indigenous storytelling, on decolonising the Nigerian law classroom by making it less exclusionary of marginal identities such as sexual and gender minorities.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'African Politics']"

Following its revision in 2019, the minimum percentage required for each sex increased to 40%. The implementation of the Portuguese Parity Law has succeeded in meeting the direct goals of the policy. However, can the same be said for all stages of implementation? Moreover, even when the numbers tell a success story, what practices and resistances do they conceal? And, finally, has the law contributed to gender empowerment that goes beyond the direct scope of the law? This chapter aims to answer these questions by focusing on the national Parliament and on the major Portuguese parties. It draws on the figures for candidates and MPs  between 2002 and 2019 as well as on semi-directive interviews with party stakeholders. The main conclusions are the following. First, the implementation of the law takes place smoothly in all four stages of implementation, although parties have usually gone no further than the minimum quota requirements. Parties’ actions and discourses demonstrate a moderate but serious commitment to the law. Second, both explicit and implicit forms of individual resistance, as well as passive institutional resistance take place at the national level for both parties. These resistances are not intended to cause policy failure, but rather to limit policy success. Third, the indirect effects of the law (i.e., gender empowerment in Parliament) are still limited.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Politics and Gender', 'Gender Studies', 'Comparative Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Public Administration']"
doi:10.1007/978-94-6265-551-5_5,en,Double Whammy: Targeted Minorities in South-Asian States,OriginalPaper,"This chapter explores ways in which both international criminal law and TWAIL fail to address the needs of accountability and remedy for violently targeted minorities in South-Asia. It will bring forth the selective, political manner of the institutionalisation of international criminal law by examining the prevalent power dynamics of the global political economy that shield powerful perpetrators, particularly in South-Asia. Majoritarian consolidation ensures the appearance of electoral democracy in these countries despite widespread crimes against minorities. Western states have a critical interest in protecting allied regimes in South-Asia due to their strategic geopolitical location and symbolic democratic appearance that provide ideological alternatives vis-à-vis China. Large population sizes in some of these countries also provide vital markets for western business interests. These factors often protect powerful perpetrators from any international scrutiny for mass crimes. The nation-state-building goals of the non-aligned post-colonies shaped TWAIL’s origin. The process of nation-building for postcolonial South-Asian states has often involved fortifying national borders that were arbitrarily and rashly drawn by former imperial powers in the first place. Such fortification involved silencing dissenting minorities through targeted state violence. Likewise, second-generation TWAIL scholarship continues to be constricted by the inapt binary of First World versus Third World. This narrow contextualisation of TWAIL scholarship restricts its lens to interests of Third World nation-states rather than the needs of their people, especially minorities. TWAIL’s foundational goals block effective engagement and articulation of the minorities’ pleas for accountability and remedy in South-Asian countries, creating its own hegemonic narrative.","['Law', 'International Criminal Law', 'Public International Law', 'Human Rights', 'Sources and Subjects of International Law, International Organizations']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-14630-5_15,en,Law-Technology Lag or Law as Technology in the Big Data Age,OriginalPaper,"In an data-driven world, people increasingly value the protection and security of their personal data. Many states have adopted or are in the process of adopting data protection laws based on principles similar to those of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union, resulting in a global convergence of data protection rules. Yet doubts may arise regarding the ability of the GDPR to effectively safeguard data protection principles and rights in the age of big data and related algorithmic decision-making. Against this background, the choice of the risk-based approach as the key law enforcement mode under the GDPR might be interpreted to be a result of the recognition of a law/technology lag in this instance, in the sense of an intrinsic difficulty of the law in dealing with the pervasiveness and automation involved in present-day collection, circulation and use of the data. The risk-based approach leaves data protection decisions mainly to the data controllers. A better explanation for the GDPR’s novel enforcement mode may be found in the “law as technology” proposition, meaning a law intended to liberate the use of digital technologies. In the context of its strategy for a data-driven economy, the EU had shown its concern with European lateness in embracing the data revolution. Accordingly, EU data protection reform has been meant to reduce the administrative burden on the data controllers and processors so as to further the competitiveness of the digital single market. As a consequence, data protection will ultimately depend on how the data controllers will meet their greater responsibilities.","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy of Technology', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'History of Technology']"
doi:10.1007/978-981-19-4993-7_10,en,Civil Law and Social Changes in Korea in the Past 30 Years,OriginalPaper,"The Republic of Korea has experienced a period of rapid social change, which is generally referred to as “compressed and shortened development”. Since the Seoul Olympics in 1988, social changes have progressed more rapidly. Korea has responded quite successfully to the rapid social changes in the field of civil law. However, not all aspects of Korean civil law responded as successfully as others. The development of property law in the Korean Civil Code has lagged behind the development of family law. Property Law has mainly responded to social changes through the legislation of special acts. Family Law has responded promptly and continuously through a number of amendments of the KCC while also developing by way of adoption and amendment of special family law acts. As a result of such different responses, it could be said that property law in the KCC is more akin to a top down “Law in the Book” legislative exercise, where family law is in contrast “Law in Action”, resulting from the influences of the advocacy of women-led women’s rights civic groups, academic works of progressive family law scholars, and judgments of unconstitutionality and constitutional nonconformity of clauses of the KCC by the Constitutional Court. Presently, in the field of property law, high increases in real estate prices, real estate speculation, irregular real estate transactions by abnormal legal methods, and the incomplete recapture of windfalls are becoming growing social problems. It is hoped that in the future, real estate transactions could be normalized by way of notarization of the contract of purchase and sale and by developing legislation that facilitates the recapturing of windfalls resulting from social development projects. Much work has been done to help Korean civil law keep pace with a rapidly changing Korean society, but much work remains to be done. In the field of family law, it should be noted that the rights and interests of children whose parents have divorced should be subject to strong legal protections. Minors should be protected against the misuse of the internet through the use of sophisticated smartphones and other electronic devices. Moreover, the growing number of immigrant foreign workers, North Korean escapees, and refugees arriving in Korea has created a strong need for the legislation of an act of equal treatment (e.g., an anti-discrimination act or equality act) to protect such individuals from discrimination. Ultimately, Korean civil law shall pursue and realize justice and love, which are the eternal and utmost important values of mankind. Justice and love are the ultimate goals of the KCC and all special civil acts. This paper proposes that Korean society should evolve beyond extreme individualistic egoism and gradually transition into communitarianism. Korean civil law shall be imbued with the characteristics of social law in parallel with the changes of Korean society toward communitarianism.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Civil Law', 'Fundamentals of Law']"

The chapter then situates Hong Kong’s actual use of life imprisonment since 1997 within the worldwide practice of life imprisonment, particularly that of common law jurisdictions including England and Wales. Given the rarity of ‘de facto’ life sentences in Hong Kong, the chapter’s analysis focuses on mandatory and discretionary formal life terms pronounced by the Hong Kong courts, and their consideration by the Long-term Sentences Review Board—Hong Kong’s answer to a parole board for life-sentenced prisoners.

The wide ratification of the ICC Statute together with the domestic implementation of international criminal law and international humanitarian law, as well as the establishment of war crimes units pursuant to legislation at times allowing for universal jurisdiction can attest to the success of the complementarity system. In fact, the atrocities committed in the last decade during armed conflicts in Syria, Iraq, and Ukraine are at the centre of domestic accountability efforts that can meaningfully contribute towards the dynamic development of international criminal law, or—in the words of the Presiding Judge in a Syrian case before the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart, Germany—‘help the law, including international criminal law, achieve a breakthrough’ (OLG Stuttgart, 5—2 StE 5/17-4). This chapter will attempt an interpretation of the counter-hegemonic turn in international criminal law through the lens of the hegemony of the United Nations Security Council members, particularly Russia. Although Russia’s involvement in both Syrian and Ukrainian conflicts is significant, there has been little scholarly attention to date focusing on the Russian approaches towards the evolution of international criminal law in these contexts. The cognizance by the local populations that the UN-affiliated institutions cannot intervene in conflicts such as Syria or Eastern Ukraine, had an impact on the proliferation of grassroots documentation initiatives. These initiatives, broadly described as ‘Entrepreneurial Justice’ coordinated by civil society actors, continue to provide professional assistance to prosecution authorities which has paradoxically led to ‘justice ownership’ by the communities in Syria, Ukraine and beyond, thus pointing towards a breakthrough in the development of international criminal law.","['Law', 'International Criminal Law', 'Public International Law', 'Human Rights', 'Sources and Subjects of International Law, International Organizations']"

In the nineteenth century, the French Civil Code influenced by natural law impacted many French-speaking cantons of Switzerland, whereas the Civil Code of Zurich and the cantons of the center of Switzerland were influenced by the Pandectistic ideas of the German historical school. When Switzerland decided to codify its contract law in the second half of the nineteenth century, it had to face the divide between these two different legal cultures. Through two examples, this contribution shows how the notion of contract was defined according to the Pandectistic approach and how the regulation of the transfer of risk in sales contracts was the result of a fortunate compromise between both traditions. It was then reinterpreted by the Swiss Federal Tribunal to conform with the underlying principles of Roman law. This emphasizes that codes may be the result of compromises between (legal) cultures; to remain a suitable medium of communication between society and itself, a code should have an open texture to adapt to the evolution of society through pragmatic interpretations.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Civil Law', 'Fundamentals of Law']"

There are three types of internal displacements: disaster induced displacements, development induced displacements and conflict induced displacements. Available evidence revealed that conflict inducement displacements is the type predominant in Nigeria. As at December 2020, Nigeria has a record number of 2,730,000 IDPs from conflict zones. A breakdown of the figures reveals that about 66,087 of the IDPs were displaced by natural disasters while 915,329 were affected by the insurgency in the north eastern part of the country. Thus, there were about 20 IDPs camps across the northern part of the country. The growing and ever deadly conflicts between farmers and herders in many parts of the country is also reported to have killed thousands of people and displaced tens of thousands more. It is argued in this chapter that the adoption/implementation of the African Union Model Law for the Implementation of the African Union Convention for the Protection of and Assistance to Internally Displaced Persons in Africa (African Union Model Law) is the panacea to the intractable problems of internal displacements in Nigeria. I utilised the doctrinal and desk-based review methodology to review the different initiatives and government-led humanitarian responses to engage the problems of internal displacements in the country.

The Orthodox context of the respective legislative measure is extremely important and its specificities need to be highlighted. Requirement of the death penalty for witchcraft was extremely rare. The emergence of modern legislation has led to the disappearance of the crime of witchcraft, which was still mentioned only when it was associated with theft, deception and illegal practice of medicine. At the end of the chapter, the concept of misogyny is discussed, to explain the constitution of the image of the witch in the codes of laws, but also in other documents with legislative implications (sermons, instructions for confessors, etc.).","['History', 'European History', 'Cultural History', 'Social History']"

In this period, the ARIO prompted a critical reflection on the foundational principles of international organizations. The notion of equality is one of the most controversial issues.

In particular, I criticise the conventional description of international organizations as ‘fundamentally unequal’ and its foundation in the so-called principle of speciality. This is a very confusing notion, even if consistently applied by legal scholarship. To clarify the theoretical framework, I apply the notion of formal equality to international organizations, distinguishing it from substantive equality. I contend that the substantive inequalities affecting states and individuals are interconnected with the formal inequality of organizations. The chapter discusses issues such as unequal voting rights, unequal rules on the attribution of conduct, unequal capacity to bear obligations.

On 4 February 2021, the ICC’s Trial Chamber IX pioneered international criminal jurisprudence by convicting a defendant, for the first time with charges of forced marriage as an inhumane act and forced pregnancy. Although the crime of forced pregnancy is explicitly listed in the ICC Statute, its narrow definition is the reflection of the patriarchal fear of its criminalization as a means of interfering with national laws on abortion. The chapter analyses the negotiations of the Elements of Crimes, the ICC Statute provisions and other related discussions on the gendered nature of this crime, and the intersecting grounds that motivate its commission. The author argues that the ICC has a prominent role in addressing states’ attempts to limit the right to reproductive autonomy as explicitly depicted in its drafting history. In doing so, the chapter introduces the feminist strategy of norm transfer in order to explore how legal standards created at the level of international criminal law make their way into domestic contexts. Finally, the chapter evaluates the effect that the Ongwen judgement can have on domestic reproductive justice.","['Law', 'International Criminal Law', 'Public International Law', 'Human Rights', 'Sources and Subjects of International Law, International Organizations']"

This goal required an accurate description of the situation de lege lata , i.e. an examination of whether and if so, to what extent existing norms and institutions in international and national law can adequately and effectively address transboundary environmental damage caused by economic actors. However, such an examination would be both incomplete and soon outdated if current and emerging legal developments along with their implications were not also considered in appropriate depth. In addition to the stated goal of identifying existing legal norms and principles, this book has simultaneously endeavoured to focus on current scholarly debates, legal controversies and policy discussions about how liability for environmental damage could and should evolve de lege ferenda .","['Law', 'International Environmental Law', 'Environmental Economics']"

However, historically the origin of judicial openness, both in the history of the Chinese legal system and foreign legal systems, is mainly an open trial. According to current research findings, “public trial or open trial” is the result of the bourgeois struggle against feudalism; in the modern West, “public trial” first became the fundamental principle of litigation. This conclusion is biased due to the lack of an in-depth understanding of the judicial history of China. As the historical origin of judicial openness, public trials in the history of the Chinese legal system and foreign legal systems have been developing independently but have the same effect.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Theories of Law, Philosophy of Law, Legal History', 'Public Law']"

The plight of women of color, who are Black, Asian, Hispanic, Native American or other minority groups, has often been ignored. These women are disproportionately stalled at the bottom of society—economically, socially, and politically. American law professors developed a unique approach towards feminism to more adequately encompass the situation, known as Critical Race Feminism (CRF). CRF seeks to identify legal problems, but also formulate relevant solutions as well. CRF originated out of a much broader set of legal and social movements—most notably Critical Legal Studies (CLS), Critical Race Theory (CRT), and feminist jurisprudence. CRF also introduces its own distinct analytical contributions. CRF contradicts the traditional feminist ideology of the “essential female voice,” and instead relies on the theory of intersectionality in which CRF demarginalizes the anti-essentialist plight of women of color. This chapter also discusses an approach to women’s rights on the global level, known as Global Critical Race Feminism (GCRF).","['Law', 'Theories of Law, Philosophy of Law, Legal History', 'Gender Studies']"

Considering the Chinese tendency to impose harsh punishments upon convicted criminals to prevent future crimes, and the likelihood of the abolition of the death penalty in the not-too-distant future, life imprisonment plays an increasingly essential role in the criminal justice system of China. This chapter explores not only the legal framework and existing provisions on life imprisonment, but also introduces the general practice of imposing and implementing life sentences in China. Part 1 introduces life imprisonment as China’s penultimate penalty and sets out the structure of this chapter. Part 2 describes how life imprisonment is imposed according to the Chinese Criminal Law. Part 3 examines life imprisonment from a procedural perspective. It discusses some special procedural practices involving life imprisonment, especially the release procedures for life-sentenced prisoners, including conditional release (parole) and recall to prison. Part 4 compares Chinese legislation with international norms on life imprisonment, and identifies the gap between Chinese laws and the international treaties. Part 5 examines the Chinese practice of imposing life imprisonment and releasing life prisoners, and then suggests some key reform proposals to improve the life imprisonment system in China.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Human Rights', 'Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law', 'Social Justice, Equality and Human Rights']"

How such a coherent and sustained mnemonic narrative acts as a resource of law is considered here in relation to how it reemphasizes normative standards of Australianness which are rooted in its military past and, as such, sustains exclusions on the basis of race and sexuality. The notion of elasticity is introduced in this chapter to explain how normative and formative expectations of shared experience and national character are enacted in the form and content of the Anzac commemoration, respectively. ‘Rational’ images of Australianness are co-ordinated on temporal and spatial bases to the exclusion of others. Furthermore, on the basis of elasticity, this chapter examines how conditional inclusions can be made to the narrative which still require the privileging of normative standards rooted in militarism. Such standards are entangled with ostensibly progressive legislative enactments, demonstrating that the elasticity of state law can also be rooted in memory.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Socio-legal Studies', 'Memory Studies', 'Theories of Law, Philosophy of Law, Legal History', 'Political Science', 'Political Sociology', 'Sociology of Culture']"

The violence often times threatens cohesion within the DR. To sustain the DR, most countries adopt the criminalisation approach by enacting statutes that prescribe punishment for acts of domestic violence (DV). In Nigeria, Violence against Persons (Prohibition) Act 2015 (VAPPA) was enacted to curb domestic violence using this approach. However, there are emerging issues from that law that could impede its effectiveness. These include non-desirability of victims for criminal prosecution, consequential effect of penal punishment on cohesion of the domestic relationship, application of criminal law to domestic dispute, among other issues. The VAPPA applies to Nigerian Muslims who have the religious obligation and constitutional right to apply the Islamic law as their personal law. This work therefore examines the perspective to which Islamic law addresses those emerging issues from the legal framework on domestic violence in Nigeria with a view to providing alternative approach. Doctrinal method of research was adopted to answer the research questions and execute the objectives of this work. It is observed that criminalisation affects the cohesion of DR due to the societal attitude towards the criminal approach. Islamic law does not favour the application of criminal punishment in the case of hurt or death between family members but it approves the payment of diyah (compensation) or forgiveness. It is concluded that the use of penal approach to resolve domestic dispute or violence is not effective enough to curb the violence. Therefore, there is a need to adopt the Shari’ah mechanisms of dispute resolution which will sustain domestic cohesion by way of legal borrowing.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'African Politics']"

It offers a comprehensive review of the human rights norms, principles, procedures, and institutions that are relevant to climate change adaptation action in Africa.

Given the abuse often found in prisons, there has recently been a radical idea to replace imprisonment with other forms of punishment, where possible. Article 10 of the Indonesian Penal Code lists the primary sanctions, which include imprisonment and additional sanctions. Imprisonment consists of two types, that is, life imprisonment and imprisonment for a fixed term. Article 12 of the Penal Code refers to life imprisonment but offers no further explanation about what it means. The Penal Code , like other Indonesian laws, spells out the offences for which life imprisonment can be imposed. Some scholars believe that life imprisonment in Indonesia means imprisonment for as long as the prisoner lives, that is, until their death. The Indonesian legal system recognizes the President’s prerogative right to grant clemency, which can also be granted to life-sentenced prisoners. Life imprisonment does not facilitate the reintegration of prisoners serving this sentence, but the community gets protection from crime during their detention. The law and practice in Indonesia should be reformed to create an opportunity for these prisoners to return to society as rehabilitated individuals.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Human Rights', 'Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law', 'Social Justice, Equality and Human Rights']"

Not only did these protests enable individuals to raise their voices to denounce violations, but they were also used as a means of issuing political opinions, taking part in the redefinition of the boundaries of citizenship, excluding rivals, participating in the political arena and even trying to change the electoral results, regardless of whether these claims drew on real facts or not.","['History', 'Social History', 'Political History', 'European History', 'Modern History', 'World History, Global and Transnational History']"

Perspectives from the Global South are critical against the hegemonic elements of this regime, perceived as an instrumentalisation of global human rights norms and Western imperialism. Yet, current debates about the legitimacy of international criminal justice have tended to neglect the hegemonic and counter-hegemonic capacities of non-state actors in affected communities. This chapter inquires into the role of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Uganda’s contested criminal justice processes. The chapter draws on semi-structured interviews with both domestic and international NGO staff, lawyers and victim representatives, as well as secondary sources. It also benefits from reflections based on the author’s experience as a legal practitioner in Uganda. Drawing on the theory of legitimacy, it illustrates how NGOs may perpetuate hegemonic structures of international criminal justice through the approaches that they take regarding the prosecution of international crimes at the ICC and the International Crimes Division (ICD) of Uganda. In turn, this asserts a form of sociological legitimacy of the courts in the eyes of the affected communities. On the other hand, the chapter also highlights a limited counter-hegemonic role of some domestic NGOs that prioritize domestic accountability mechanisms over international avenues. Ultimately, attention to NGOs as critical actors is essential if we are to sustain the counter-hegemonic debates in international criminal justice. The findings point to the increasing role of NGOs as key stakeholders in the future of the international criminal justice project.","['Law', 'International Criminal Law', 'Public International Law', 'Human Rights', 'Sources and Subjects of International Law, International Organizations']"

From only a handful of economies in North America and Europe, the adoption of competition law and policy has spread rapidly to Asian economies since 1990. Like their Western counterparts several decades earlier, most Asian jurisdictions have exempted agriculture, albeit in varying degrees, from the prohibitions of competition law, such as those involving the exercise of market power by farmers’ associations. Public choice considerations suggest that the exemption serves as a countervailing force for the farmers’ comparatively weak position in the balance of political influence for agricultural policy and in bargaining power over the more concentrated wholesale-retail segments of the agri-food value chain. Farm heterogeneity and farm-operation consolidation, induced in part by the economy’s structural transformation, weaken the case for broad exemption.","['Economics', 'Agricultural Economics', 'Development Economics', 'Development Studies', 'Agriculture']"

The regime of deep seabed mining (DSM) in the Area foresees three phases: prospecting, exploration and exploitation. The exploration and exploitation phases involve several actors, including States, the International Seabed Authority (ISA or Authority) and private entities. Established under UNCLOS, the ISA is tasked with controlling and organising “activities in the Area, particularly with a view to administering the resources of the Area”. To date, the ISA has developed regulations related to exploration for minerals in the Area which set out the standard terms of exploration contracts as well as the requirements to apply for exploration rights. DSM in the Area is currently transitioning from the exploration phase into the exploitation phase, and the ISA is developing rules for the assessment and environmental management of future operations.","['Law', 'International Environmental Law', 'Environmental Economics']"

The digital ecosystem has been a major contributor in sustaining the global economy and mitigating both the financial and social crises that are plaguing the world. The merit and reliability of technology have been reinforced in light of recent events. The digital economy is not perfect, to say the least, with major concerns regarding rampant anti-competitive conduct by the few enterprises that dominate the market. Competition law around the world has proven to be inefficient in dealing with these technological giants and before a remedy could be found, blockchain technology has started gaining traction which has the potential to change the face of not just the digital economy, but society as we know it. The virtue of decentralisation has long been considered a desirable state for the digital economy and blockchain offers the means to achieve this, and much more. This paper explores how competition law and blockchain both seek decentralisation and aims to ascertain how they can help each other achieve this in a way that builds a sustainable digital economy. The paper makes an exploratory analysis of the various interactions between competition laws and blockchain, based on which we conclude that regulating blockchain through competition laws can address the pressing needs of the global digital economy.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

In practice, ambiguity, debate, and uncertainty encompass academic freedom, both as a professional standard and as a constitutional First Amendment concept. Debates over constitutional academic freedom extend to whether it exists as a legitimate legal doctrine at all, either as an individual right faculty can claim or one shared with or exclusive to higher education institutions. Likewise, academic freedom as a professional norm faces increasing strain. Tenure, devised as the principal employment arrangement to uphold academic freedom by providing financial security to faculty, is increasingly only available to a declining percentage of professors. This chapter examines definitions and conceptions of academic freedom as a professional norm in higher education and as a constitutional concept. The chapter also addresses related issues, such as connections between tenure or collective bargaining and academic freedom. The authors consider as well interpretations of academic freedom in other countries and from an international perspective. Suggestions for future research on academic freedom are also offered in the chapter.","['Education', 'Higher Education', 'Educational Policy and Politics', 'Administration, Organization and Leadership', 'Sociology of Education', 'Curriculum Studies']"

Drawing from the restorative justice and crime control literature, the paper argues that given the nature of corporate fraud and the stakeholders Stakeholder Power affected, restorative justice can have an impact in disciplining corporate offenders. Restorative justice is a different framework from criminal justice or regulatory proceedings. A restorative approach to justice sees crime as involving all the stakeholders affected by the offender’s action. In the aftermath of a crime, the victim, offender, community, and authorities meet to discuss how the offenses affected the lives of the victims and neutralize its collective impact. The fundamental postulate of restorative justice is to promote healing and rehabilitation for the victim, offender, and all other stakeholders affected by the crime. While restorative justice is widely used in addressing street crimes, little effort has been made to link its applicability to corporate crime.","['Business and Management', 'Business and Management, general', 'Business Ethics', 'Sustainable Development', 'Corporate Governance']"

Datafication, digitalisation, data-driven markets, online platforms, digital economy, the Internet of Things—even this short list of examples highlights that a new set of terminology requires interpretation and the underlying new market phenomena require new assessment methods. The digitalisation of the value chain is reshaping processes from the development of products through production, logistics and sales systems to their acquisition by end users. Product digitalisation is creating new markets and is fundamentally changing data-driven business models, which are simultaneously generating new organisational structures and working methods. There are industries where consumers pay with their personal data for ‘free’ services, and consumers’ data serve as the fuel for economic growth. These parallel processes result in new channels and context in the communication with buyers, consumers, customers, clients, users and employees. At the same time, traditional roles have been expanded since consumers are present on the demand side not only by virtue of their purchasing decisions but also because they create new content, share information, rank products and discuss their performed or planned consumer choices in all available public fora.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'IT Law, Media Law, Intellectual Property', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Online Marketing/Social Media', 'Big Data', 'International Economic Law, Trade Law']"

Some of these are horizontal themes of constitutional nature, such as the procedure for the adoption, the issue of secrecy that arises therein, and the effectiveness of this foreign policy tool. There are two possible way to categorise sanctions: first, one may distinguish between country sanctions one the one hand, and individual sanctions on the other hand. Second, it is possible to classify sanctions depending on the rationale for their adoption: terrorist sanctions, counterproliferation sanctions, cybersanctions, sanctions against democratic backsliding or in conflict situation. In the light of the variety (and complexity) of the political and legal issues involved, and of major developments in the case law of the CJEU in the period under analysis, the chapter then concentrates on the case law of the Court to highlight salient features of judicial protection afforded against restrictive measures and CFSP acts more broadly.","['Law', 'European Law', 'European Politics']"

This term generally appears linear in the square-root of movement amplitude or as the product of this quantity with the square-root of transported mass. In underwater movements it appears as the mass effects of accelerating fluid particles about the moving limb. It is suggested that the occurrence of the modified form of Fitts’ law arises when the mass effects of a load exceed the capability Capabilities of the limb muscles to accommodate Accommodate the forces arising from acceleration of the load during the distance-covering phase of the movements. It appears that, as a general form, the modified model for Fitts’ law needs to be tested in most experimental arrangements. Fitts’ law for aimed movement time needs to be modified from its usual form when there are significant loads to be transferred, with the form dependent on how the inertia loads are produced. These inertia forces generally arise during the high acceleration distance-covering phase of the movement.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Between 2009 and date, over 400 girls have been abducted and subjected to different experiences as sexual slaves, violation of their dignity, and denial of the right to education. The paper argues that with the changing state of public international law and the redefinition of offences like that of sexual violence that there are existing prospects for improving the experience of victims of sexual violence. Bringing into context decisions and policy documents from international law judicial bodies, the paper would examine the influence on municipal laws in Nigeria. For instance, in investigating the doctrine of Responsibility to Protect (R2P), the paper argues that there is a need also to embrace other measures toward changing the narratives of the victims in the unfortunate incidents. An overview of the philosophical basis for the actions of the perpetrators continues to defy reasons or comprehension. It is therefore the argument of the paper, that there is a need to deconstruct the norm (acceptance of sexual violence) as a male dominant theory of oppression to elevate the dignity of the female gender and call for greater respect and preservation. In addition, it would advocate the need to drive a new paradigm in the teaching of international law in Nigeria to reflect the developing and new discourse.

If the state is understood as a republic and the basis of stability and prosperity, then the achievement of social peace is possible only with a proper understanding of the public-law institution of public services. The public authorities and the public-law institution of the civil services will be able to resist other problems of the twenty-first century effectively. Moreover, scientists have called the activities leading to climate change as the biggest threat of this century. In this regard, the paper aims to form a well-founded understanding of the public-law institution of civil services in the context of the fourth industrial revolution. The research used systemic methods, methods of comparative jurisprudence, and logical analysis. A significant place is given to the methods of exegesis and hermeneutics. During the analysis, the value and significance of the public-law institution of civil services in the new conditions were substantiated. Realizing the people’s collective will, civil servants ensure the proper solution of “common affairs,” which is the essence of the state as the “trinity” of territory, population, and power. Together with the public interest, private interest is fully realized. The central role in solving the associated problems of climate change will be played by the public authorities and the public-law institution of the civil services. As a result of the study, it was found that in the context of the fourth industrial revolution, the public-law institution of civil services acquires particular importance for ensuring the stable development of a modern state and solving both internal and global problems.","['Business and Management', 'Business Strategy/Leadership', 'Management', 'Economic Growth', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Asian Economics', 'International Organization']"

As a commodity, the high value, portable, and concealable nature of jewellery makes it an attractive target for opportunistic thieves, organised crime gangs, and other criminal magpies. The ‘value’ of jewellery, however, is inherently polysemic, and thus the impact of jewellery-related crime is not limited solely to economic loss. Beyond the more obvious financial reasons that jewellery is increasingly a criminal target, lies a sinister betrayal of the centuries-old human preoccupation with precious metals and gemstones. With many items of jewellery operating as treasured family heirlooms, signifiers of meaningful relationships, or memorials for deep personal loss; the true cost of jewellery and gem-related crime is often painfully human—even the loss of life itself. Drawing upon the authors combined 35 years of research and professional experience across both law enforcement and the jewellery industry respectively; this chapter will discuss the spectrum of criminal activity related to jewellery and gemstones internationally. It will consider jewellery’s ability to both provoke crime and simultaneously solve it; exploring the criminal attraction to jewellery and the motivations that lie behind jewellery crime, through to the inherent nature and forensic properties of jewellery and gemstones themselves as useful investigative tools in instances of crime, death, and disaster. The authors will conclude by highlighting the lack of awareness amongst the law enforcement community and the challenges faced by police in tracing, identifying, and recovering jewellery items. They will culminate by promoting the need for more proactive collaboration between law enforcement professionals and jewellery industry personnel, in order to prevent and deter individuals from utilising jewellery and gemstones as enablers of criminal activity.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Cultural Heritage', 'Archaeology', 'Organized Crime']"

The majority of States and scholars from the Global South fervently promoted the international criminal justice project, believing in the counter-hegemonic potential of its subject-matter jurisdiction. The chapter argues that the limited subject-matter jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court failed to address the concerns of a substantial part of the international community, in the name of which the Court operates. In doing so, the drafters of the ICC Statute subverted the counter-hegemonic capacity of the institution and opened the door to potentially competing regional projects.","['Law', 'International Criminal Law', 'Public International Law', 'Human Rights', 'Sources and Subjects of International Law, International Organizations']"

IOSCO leverages internal and external implementation mechanisms. The internal one is a peer-pressure system based on Thematic Reviews and the Standards Implementation Monitoring (ISIM) program—concerning single topics across different jurisdictions—and on Country Reviews—concerning one country across different topics. The external system is run by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank primarily via the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). The peer reviews of the Financial Stability Board also contribute to this external implementation mechanism. By analyzing the publicly available IMF Reports, the Chapter ranks IOSCO Members. The analysis shows that differences in implementation degree between advanced and emerging securities markets still persist. Most importantly, alongside peer-pressure, implementation is also fostered by a peer-assistance mechanism channeled via Regulatory Capacity Building programs. The Chapter draws the conclusion that the IOSCO’s implementation strategies are based on a combination of institutionalized peer-pressure and institutionalized peer-assistance.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'European Law', 'International Economic Law, Trade Law']"

The study also aims to illustrate the balance between two rights; the right of privacy for individuals’ data, especially patients infected with the Corona virus and the right of authorized parties to access this data in order to limit the spread of this virus. In order to achieve the study objectives, it discussed the nature of the concepts of privacy and personal data, and indicated the legislative treatments of the patients’ data, whether it was through the general criminal law, or through laws related to informatics, through medical charters, or even through the legislation related to the pandemic and to explain how these concepts contributed to the criminal protection of patients’ data. The study combined the analytical and comparative approach, and it concluded that the current legislation is not sufficient to protect a right worthy of legal protection, which is the right of privacy in personal data. The privacy of personal data has been exposed to many violations in the light of cyberspace, which requires legislators to hurry to issue special laws that surround personal data with a fence of criminal protection.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

All staff members must be proficient in at least one of its working languages, English and French. As in other comparable institutions, however, the reality is that English has become the Court’s lingua franca. What does the dominant role of English mean for the ICC’s ability to further the international criminal justice project? How does the status of English at the Court privilege those professionals for whom it is a native language, as well as the legal framework they bring with them? What kinds of conceptual limitations does dependence on a single language create for an institution aiming to promote what it considers globally applicable principles? Does the ICC’s objective of delivering global justice enable, in fact, the dominance of the contemporary worldwide lingua franca without too much pushback? This chapter, based on a multi-year ethnographic project on how the ICC addresses diverse language challenges, explores the impact of the uneven status of the Court’s working languages on those who work at and with the ICC, as well as on what the Court conveys to the world through the communications of its top officials, its judgments, its outreach activities, and its everyday language choices. It is shown that English-language hegemony is not only entrenched but has detrimental effects for the ICC in both practical and symbolic spheres, rendering the Court less efficient while also undermining its mission as a global institution.","['Law', 'International Criminal Law', 'Public International Law', 'Human Rights', 'Sources and Subjects of International Law, International Organizations']"

It allows citizens and permanent residents over the age of 18 to participate in sex work, whether as sex workers, buyers of sex or brothel operators, without criminal sanction. Decriminalisation allows brothels to be considered as ‘businesses like any other’, allowing them to be subject to the same laws that govern businesses in other sectors. Decriminalisation in New Zealand establishes the conditions under which sex workers’ wellbeing, safety and sexual health can be facilitated. Because sex work no longer needs to be conducted invisibly, decriminalisation can destabilise the conditions in which sex workers are subject to violence, blackmail and coercion. This chapter looks at how decriminalisation is positioned in contrast to other models of sex work governance, and examines the provisions of the PRA. It sets out the contours of the New Zealand brothel sector and provides an overview of the managed sex industry in New Zealand post-decriminalisation.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime and Society', 'Critical Criminology', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Gender Studies', 'Social Policy', 'Politics of the Welfare State']"

Standards make our lives as consumers easier. For instance, a Wi-Fi-enabled smartphone device will connect to a Wi-Fi connection regardless of the jurisdiction. It has happened because Wi-Fi is a standard, which has been unanimously adopted by all stakeholders. There are technical standards adopted through several standard setting organizations, and there are standards adopted through market demand, which have evolved with time. Standard setting organizations (SSOs) play a crucial role in operationalizing a standard. The stages through which a standard is operationalized are often fraught with uncertainty, and a lot depends on the internal structure of an SSO. The most significant contributor to the entire process is the IPR policies adopted by each of these SSOs. This chapter provides a glimpse of these IPR policies of SSOs in three different jurisdictions, i.e., Europe, the United States, and India. These policies show their diverse nature and often lead to complex end-results.","['Law', 'IT Law, Media Law, Intellectual Property', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Law and Economics']"

It has massive, long-term, and transboundary impact on both human health and biodiversity. Although new technologies have been invented to minimize the risks of nuclear emergencies, yet there is no guarantee of zero accident. That is why most of the developed countries have reduced dependency on nuclear energy over the past couple of decades. Despite that, Bangladesh being a developing country, geo-climatically vulnerable to natural disasters and one of the most densely populated countries, initiated to launch its first nuclear-based power plant at Rooppur in 2023. As a rapid growing economy, currently Bangladesh has huge demand of electricity, while the present government is trying to increase the production quickly through nuclear energy and decrease the dependence on gas and other fossils. Consequently, it has to take utmost care of international safety arrangements to produce electricity from nuclear source. A comprehensive emergency preparedness plan, a truly empowered regulatory body, and highest compliance of international nuclear safety laws are key to minimize the risks of nuclear disaster. Otherwise, any nuclear accident will bring unbearable distress not only in Bangladesh but also to its neighbors. Thus, this brief paper aims to assess and closely look into the compatibility of the existing legislative frameworks of Bangladesh in ensuring safety in nuclear power plants with the globally accepted standards.","['Business and Management', 'Sustainability Management', 'Social Policy', 'Natural Hazards', 'Climate Change Management and Policy', 'Environmental Law/Policy/Ecojustice']"

A survey was conducted among different road users in Kerala to study the perceived safety about motorized two-wheeler users. The survey asked individuals to rate the level of risk associated with activities that can cause accidents and their agreement with increasing law enforcements. The survey responses were analysed using structural equation modelling to understand the relationship between risk perception, user’s confidence and law enforcement. The study showed that risk perception and user’s confidence are correlated (−0.51) but not user’s confidence and law enforcement (−0.06). Risk perception positively influences user’s agreement with stricter law enforcement (0.21). There is higher correlation between risk perception and user’s confidence among males (−0.52) than females (−0.31). Both user’s confidence and risk perception influence females’ agreement with higher law enforcement.

One barrier to equality is the bias that we hold against members of particular groups, which may be unconscious. Many companies have turned to ‘unconscious bias training’ as a way to tackle gender inequality. The aim of this training is laudable. It raises awareness of prejudices we hold and can provide pause for thought during decision-making. However, treating inequality as the manifestation of individual bias can be problematic. This chapter examines the implications of the trend to view discrimination as a psychological problem and questions whether this is the optimal approach for companies who intend to pursue a more socially sustainable path. It shows how interrogating the meaningfulness of unconscious bias training is only possible by considering the matter from an interdisciplinary perspective that engages the insights offered by sociology, psychology, and moral philosophy to allow us to understand the limitations of law’s approach to unconscious bias. While the key aim of this chapter is to offer the dilemma of unconscious bias training as a case study in the need for interdisciplinary scholarship, it also advances the argument that viewing discrimination as the expression of an individual’s unconscious beliefs can be problematic.","['Business and Management', 'Sustainability Management', 'Economic Geography', 'Diversity Management/Women in Business', 'Law and Economics', 'Business Ethics']"

The methodology employed in this paper is doctrinal with the use of both primary and secondary sources of the Nigerian Law. There is, therefore, a need to expand the Law School curriculum to give room for disabilities courses in as much as these courses foster PWDs’ status as lawyers in courts. The research found that the curriculum of the Nigerian Law School is yet to cover disabilities courses that will make their appearances in court a viable experience as this is connected to the fact that disabilities courses are not being taught at the Law School.

Safety measures are often described as paternalistic, i.e., as protecting people against their own will. This chapter provides a historical account of such criticism of safety measures, beginning with nineteenth-century opposition to sanitation measures, which were claimed to threaten the freedom to drink dirty water. The historical analysis has a surprising conclusion: Opposition to safety measures does not seem to have much to do with paternalism. Some measures that would typically be described as paternalistic, such as seat belts in commercial aviation and hard hats on construction sites, have met with no significant opposition. In contrast, some of the most vehemently opposed measures, such as speed limits and the prohibition of drunk driving, cannot with any vestige of credibility be described as paternalistic. This is followed by an analysis showing that due to our tendency to follow examples set by others (herd effects), purely self-affecting behavior is much less common than what has usually been assumed. Most of the opposition to safety measures in road traffic seem to result from some individuals’ desires to engage in activities that endanger other people’s lives.

Facebook appealed this decision to the OLG Düsseldorf (Oberlandesgericht, Higher Regional Court). A court decision on the merits in the main proceedings has—as of September 2021—not yet been taken. However, there have been several preliminary rulings regarding the immediate enforceability of the Bundeskartellamt’s decision. In case of serious doubts regarding the legality of the Bundeskartellamt’s decision, the court may order the appeal to have a suspensive effect (§ 65 III sentence 1 No. 2 GWB). In a preliminary ruling, the OLG Düsseldorf had initially suspended the decision of the Bundeskartellamt. This interim decision by the OLG Düsseldorf was in turn reversed by the Bundesgerichtshof (BGH, Supreme Court) in June 2020. The BGH stated that it does not have serious doubts as to the existence of abuse of market power by Facebook and confirmed the immediate enforceability of the Bundeskartellamt’s decision. As a next step, the Facebook case is to be decided in the main proceedings by the OLG Düsseldorf. This decision may then again be appealed to the BGH. However, in March 2021, the OLG Düsseldorf has made a referral to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'IT Law, Media Law, Intellectual Property', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Online Marketing/Social Media', 'Big Data', 'International Economic Law, Trade Law']"

But no authors have yet studied whether there are differences between the use of guns in daily operations by police and the military. Nor has there been an analysis of whether the militarization of the police increases the use of firearms. Based on data on the use of guns during arrests by the police and armed forces, drawn from the National Survey of the Population Deprived of Liberty (ENPOL, 2016), in this chapter we address both questions. Through binomial logistical models we show that the use of firearms is more frequent by members of the Army and Marines than by local police, although with some significant nuances. Furthermore, several investigations have pointed to the incorporation of high-ranking military officers into the upper ranks of police organizations as an indicator of their militarization. The results of binomial logistical models show that police who are led by military officers are more inclined to use guns during arrests than those led by civilians.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Crime and Society', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Public Health']"

Safety measures are often described as paternalistic, i.e., as protecting people against their own will. This chapter provides a historical account of such criticism of safety measures, beginning with nineteenth-century opposition to sanitation measures, which were claimed to threaten the freedom to drink dirty water. The historical analysis has a surprising conclusion: Opposition to safety measures does not seem to have much to do with paternalism. Some measures that would typically be described as paternalistic, such as seat belts in commercial aviation and hard hats on construction sites, have met with no significant opposition. In contrast, some of the most vehemently opposed measures, such as speed limits and the prohibition of drunk driving, cannot with any vestige of credibility be described as paternalistic. This is followed by an analysis showing that due to our tendency to follow examples set by others (herd effects), purely self-affecting behavior is much less common than what has usually been assumed. Most of the opposition to safety measures in road traffic seem to result from some individuals’ desires to engage in activities that endanger other people’s lives. The social need to restrain the satisfaction of such desires is obvious.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

For every critical incident of this kind, there are many more police-involved mental health crisis interventions that occur in the community which are successfully de-escalated and safely resolved without the need for police use of force. But by virtue of their circumstances, fatal mental health crisis interventions attract the greater proportion of media attention and public and political scrutiny, and with good reason. Given that the highest calling of police duty is to protect life, it is only appropriate that after a critical incident of this kind consideration is given to whether there was not some other way the situation could have been resolved. Less examined is how these civilian deaths have become something of a marketing opportunity for police technology companies, with large investments made into alternatives to police firearms, based on the assumption that less-lethal tactical options will reduce the number of fatalities and provide a technological ‘fix’ to the perceived crisis in police legitimacy. This chapter addresses the complexities of fatal police-citizen encounters involving mental illness, the ways in which they are typically covered in news media, and the ‘solutions’ that have been sought to prevent the police use of lethal force. The chapter asks what could be done better in relation to mental health crises in the community, examining more recent attempts in Australia to reframe the response as one that should be led by health professionals rather than police.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Crime and Society', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Public Health']"

Firstly, the single UAV impact angle controllable model and impact time cooperative control model are established. Secondly, the inclination angle and deflection angle of line of sight (LOS) controllable guide law and velocity cooperative control law are designed by using nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control theory and consistency theory respectively. Finally, the extended state observer (ESO) is used to solve the problem of accurate control of swarm impact time under disturbance, and the expected time reference signal is introduced to achieve high-velocity simultaneous arrival of UAV swarm. The simulation results show that the proposed guidance laws can make the impact angle and time of UAV swarm converge to the expected value in a finite time. The introduced ESO can accurately estimate and compensate the external disturbance, and effectively enhance the robustness of impact time cooperative control.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Multiagent Systems', 'Systems Theory, Control']"

Additionally, space activities generate environmental risks in outer space that can, at times, impact the Earth as what goes up, must inevitably come down. The hazards of spaceflight come from multiple sources, including, but not limited to, the technology used (e.g. nuclear power sources) and the hostile nature of outer space which is difficult to reach, difficult to survive in and difficult to return from. This inherent danger has been tragically highlighted not only by the shuttle disasters involving Challenger (1986) and Columbia (2003) but also by the vast field of radioactive debris left in Canada after the uncontrolled re-entry of the Soviet satellite Cosmos 954 in 1977. The latter accident exemplifies that ultra-hazardous activities require liability rules because when something goes wrong, the consequences can be significant for any injured parties.","['Law', 'International Environmental Law', 'Environmental Economics']"

The 2004 enlargement is a watershed moment in EU foreign policy and for Europe’s geopolitics—and from which the need for Treaty reforms, achieved eventually in Lisbon three years later, ultimately rose. In turn, EU law—and CFSP in particular—has not yet caught up with that enlargement. If history ‘moves’ through contradictions, then the EU legal system, with its multi-layered, cumbersome, exasperatingly technical mechanisms remindful of a Medieval empire, will need to draw level with the geopolitical reality that the enlargement created, and that the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine shattered again—and it is possible to speculate that once it will have done so, geopolitical equilibria in Europe may move again (or, more likely, that they will have moved by the time EU law has ‘caught up’ with the current ones).","['Law', 'European Law', 'European Politics']"

Supported by the literature, we argue that corporate sustainability is often weak sustainability, where sustainability issues are sought to be integrated into business rather than positioning business within sustainability. Drawing on a research-based understanding of sustainability, we propose the following definition of sustainable business: A business is sustainable when it, in aggregate, contributes to securing the social foundations for humanity, now and for the future, within planetary boundaries. We then focus on the role of interdisciplinarity for sustainable business research. We present the Daughters of Themis Network and its call for papers, which focused on moving beyond the widely accepted acknowledgement of the need for interdisciplinarity and instead explored how interdisciplinarity can be brought into effect. We briefly present the contributions in this volume, organised in three parts: Reflections, Theory, and Practice. The chapters present the depth and variety of interdisciplinary business research. We conclude with a call for strong interdisciplinarity in sustainable business research to overcome the limitations of our disciplines and to work towards the development of new methodologies and new knowledge to further sustainable business.","['Business and Management', 'Sustainability Management', 'Economic Geography', 'Diversity Management/Women in Business', 'Law and Economics', 'Business Ethics']"

International Legal/Political Doctrines in Opposition & Their Implications for Karabakh,OriginalPaper,"This chapter analyzes the long-running, frozen-unfrozen conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh (Artsakh) that constitutes the most recent example of the continuing clash between the oft-opposed international legal/political doctrines of self-determination (maintained by Armenia) and territorial integrity (advocated by Azerbaijan) to conclude that the latter trumps the former. The author examines international legal practice regarding the UN, Helsinki Final Act of 1975, various ICJ decisions regarding former Yugoslavia and Africa, the international legal doctrines of sovereignty, succession, and uti possidetis, among others, to reach this conclusion. However, there is nothing in international law that prohibits successful secession as the cases of Eritrea and Kosovo, among others, illustrate. However, either the secession must be won in war or accepted peacefully by the original mother state. Neither occurred in the case of Nagorno-Karabakh. Remedial secession and internal self-determination also offer more flexible interpretations of the applicability of self-determination, but do not constitute international law or detract in any way from the conclusion that territorial integrity takes precedence over self-determination.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics']"

It was a reaction to heightened international awareness of the exponential growth of hazardous waste being produced and the risks it presented to human health, property and the environment while being transported around the globe. The Basel Convention primarily aims to minimise the generation and transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and to keep risks at a tolerable level. It was also a response to the practice of exporting increasing amounts of hazardous waste from the Global North to the Global South. Hence, the Convention is supposed to address concerns regarding environmental justice which arise when industrialised countries profit by exploiting the precarious economic positions of nations in the Global South. Economically challenged countries may accordingly be under pressure to prioritise economic development over environmental concerns when they are offered foreign payments in exchange for accepting toxic waste shipments. By dealing with the disproportionately large share of the burden regarding hazardous waste developing nations face, the Basel Convention has been touted as one of the international agreements at the forefront of integrating environmental justice principles into global trade.","['Law', 'International Environmental Law', 'Environmental Economics']"

The Ambiguous Effects of Gender Quotas in Polish Parliamentary Elections,OriginalPaper,"Gender quotas for political party lists in elections have been legislated in Poland in 2011. The aim was to increase women’s descriptive representation at all levels, from European to local. This has been achieved to an extent: while women made up 20% of Polish parliamentarians in 2009 (before the gender quota law), their number reached 28% after the parliamentary election of 2019. Yet, the level of increase over almost a decade has been disappointing. Why has the gender quota law had mixed results? What role does the discursive framing of (the importance of) gender quotas play in their implementation? The chapter examines the details of the implementation of the gender quota law in Poland and explores the effects of the different approaches that political parties take in implementing the gender quota law. Overall, there is a dearth of literature on gender quotas in Eastern Europe and Poland is a highly relevant case because the right dominates the political scene. Moreover, Polish politics reflects an “aversion” to gender equality mechanisms present in  many post-state socialist states, where such mechanisms are seen as forced emancipation and tokenism. Therefore, I explore the dominant discursive frames to explain how political parties understand gender quotas and, consequently, what effects these frames have for implementation in the Polish context.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Politics and Gender', 'Gender Studies', 'Comparative Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Public Administration']"

Mainstream theories are those that have dominated particular epochs and the legacy of political thought as a whole, and which tend to be universally accepted. Mainstream theories have been characterized by the male dominated discourse and considerations. Introducing of gender equality perspective into the mainstream political thought assumes a critical reconsideration of the mentioned legacy from a feminist perspective. The legacy of feminist thought is increasingly growing, yet it is mostly overlooked or marginalized, with little systemic or substantial impact on the mainstream political thought. The background of the mentioned invisibility and neglect of women throughout the legacy of political philosophy and contemporary mainstream political thought will be outlined in the introduction. Certain conceptual clarifications related to pre-modern and modern times, and the political ideas associated with them, will be briefly discussed. The first chapter will be devoted to a detailed elaboration of the introductory ideas concerning a gender incompetent history of political philosophy, primarily gender-insensitive contemporary political philosophy of justice and accompanying political theories. The political ideas of Aristotle and John Rawls will be taken as a paradigmatic example. The second chapter will consider the meaning and aspects of gender perspective in the political thought, with a sub-chapter devoted to laying out the ideas that converged and became common among the different streams of feminist thought. The third chapter offers a gender competent reconsideration of the old, already existing political categories, as well as new ones brought by feminists to political theories. The conclusion will reemphasize the importance of introducing the most relevant feminist ideas and gender competent political notions into the mainstream of political thought.","['Law', 'Theories of Law, Philosophy of Law, Legal History', 'Gender Studies']"

This chapter goes back to that history. It analyzes the contributions of Thomas Paine and the Marquis de Condorcet to the merging of democracy and republicanism.

Although established some three decades ago as the principal legal organ for facilitating effective regional integration in the sub-continent, the Court’s role and significance in the integrative process has been minimal. Apart from deficiencies in the legal text of the ECOWAS, there are implementation challenges arising out of lack of sufficient political will from the Member States for effective regional judicial framework for enforcement of obligations imposed by the Treaty and the associated Protocols and Conventions. Against the background of some useful lessons from the experience of the European Court of Justice, the model of which was envisioned and created by the political leaders of the ECOWAS, this paper examines the powers of the Court within the framework of the instruments of the economic community and assesses the Court’s contributions as well as challenges facing it notwithstanding its avowed determination to define an acceptable legal order in the West African sub-region.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'African Politics']"

We start by looking at the historic decisions to ‘disarm’ the gardaí and explore the extent to which this label can be accurately applied to the Irish police. Looking at current figures around use of force, we argue that the concept of the unarmed police in Ireland is more mythical than real. We then move to examine the consequences of that myth: that there has been a lack of transparency, oversight, professionalism and accountability for gun use by police in Ireland. We explore this primarily through a human rights lens, arguing that by clinging to the ‘unarmed’ myth, Ireland is not living up to its human rights obligations. Finally, we explore what the Irish experience of being ‘unarmed’ can tell us for the broader question of whether police should routinely carry guns.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Crime and Society', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Public Health']"

Known under the joint title Volksschutzgesetze (Laws for the Protection of Nationality), the six draft laws that the SdP presented to the Czechoslovak Parliament in 1937 foresaw a far-reaching re-organisation of the state along national lines and on a purely non-territorial basis. As such, the SdP’s legal demands can be treated as a clear example of NTA. At the same time, they may also be viewed as an instance of a radical nationalist and openly illiberal adaptation of the concept. Informed by contemporary völkisch sociological, legal and political thought, the bills aimed at transforming Czechoslovakia into a federation of largely autarchic ethno-national communities. This was to be done on the basis of an involuntary, binding and essentialising definition of nationality and a fundamentally illiberal conception of collective rights, in which the rights of the national group came before those of their individual members. The envisaged scope of national self-rule was furthermore meant to extend far beyond the confines of culture and education, encompassing a wide array of other spheres of life also considered to be essentially ‘national’. Lastly, the Volksschutzgesetze also effectively negated Czechoslovakia’s self-understanding as a nation-state by transposing the notion of sovereignty from the whole of its citizenry to the individual ethnic groups inhabiting it. In clear contrast to the 1925 Estonian Law on Cultural Autonomy as the model interwar example of NTA, they were thus effectively at odds with both liberal democracy and the nation-state.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Comparative Politics', 'Language Policy and Planning', 'Governance and Government', 'Political Science']"

By exploiting variation induced by changes in legislation across time and between US states during the early twentieth century, I show that parents chose to have fewer children in response to the constraints imposed on the labor supply of their potential children and the increase in their expected quality. My findings suggest that compulsory schooling laws and child labor regulation contributed to the demographic transition in the US and provide additional empirical support for the notion that financial incentives play a role in determining household fertility decisions.","['Economics', 'Population Economics', 'Labor Economics', 'Demography', 'Social Policy']"

In many countries where institutionalised NTA arrangements exist, NTA bodies have public powers and a recognised role, inter alia, in the implementations of those rights. Therefore, the paper will first analyse the normative framework of public powers of such bodies. Bearing in mind that the scope of public powers in the field of exercising linguistic rights is variable, the focus of this paper will be on the analysis of comparative compliance and the scope that NTA arrangements can achieve in the implementation of linguistic rights. Some of the powers in the field of language rights that will be analysed in this context refer to the role of the NTA arrangements in terms of determining the name of the language of a community represented by such arrangements, its standardisation and official use. In that sense, particular focus will be put on the analysis of the distinctive role of the councils of national minorities in the Republic of Serbia in terms of determining the traditional names of settlements. This unique form of public power of the NTA arrangement is somewhat contradictory in the Serbian legal system, since it is, on the one hand, set as a very extensive and authoritative power, and on the other hand, under the threat of transferring its exercise to the government, it is limited by short deadlines.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Comparative Politics', 'Language Policy and Planning', 'Governance and Government', 'Political Science']"

The authors found that Bangladesh’s prison system functions primarily as a punishment centre with inadequate amenities making prison life inhuman for life-sentenced prisoners. The dearth of opportunities for rehabilitation exacerbates the difficulties faced by life-sentenced prisoners both during and after their incarceration. This chapter concludes that life imprisonment should be for a set period, after which release should be routinely and effectively considered, providing life-sentenced prisoners with a genuine prospect of release, even if it is not given right away. Furthermore, life imprisonment should be constructive, allowing life-sentenced prisoners to live a healthy and dignified life whilst exercising all their inherent rights, including conjugal rights. Immediate essential amendments to existing legislation are required to ensure constructive prison experiences for life-sentenced prisoners. In the longer term, a multidisciplinary sentencing management system is recommended to be introduced by enacting comprehensive legislation, whilst adhering to international norms, to facilitate a constructive prison experience for life-sentenced prisoners in Bangladesh.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Human Rights', 'Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law', 'Social Justice, Equality and Human Rights']"

The Cartagena Protocol pursues the goal of reconciling the economic interests of the biotechnology industry with environmental concerns and, by doing so, is supposed to provide a framework to meet the respective needs of trade and environmental protection with respect to the rapidly growing global biotechnology industry. On the one hand, the Protocol is designed to enable the access to and transfer of technologies regarding the development and use of living modified organisms (LMOs) which are seen to potentially provide considerable socio-economic benefits. Such a typically commercial use may be contained in controlled settings, or involve the release of the organisms into the environment for application in agricultural or industrial production-processes or products. This entails serious risks of environmental damage. The Cartagena Protocol, therefore, seeks to ensure the development of appropriate procedures to enhance the safety of biotechnology, to reduce potential threats to biological diversity, taking also into account the risks to human health. It does so with a particular focus on transboundary movements. The reasons cited for the need for a specific liability regime regarding LMOs and the potential damage they may cause relate to many of the specific problems associated with such organisms: For example, once LMOs are released, the transgenes cannot be easily recalled or removed from the environment. There may be possible long-term effects, whereby damage may only appear over time or even increase incrementally over time. Furthermore, some of the difficulties common to liability in an environmental damage context become acute when dealing with LMOs, such as in proving damage and causation, valuing areas damaged by LMOs, which may be not as well developed under existing liability regimes, as well as defining the affected persons who can bring a claim, e.g., on behalf of the environment or affected communities.","['Law', 'International Environmental Law', 'Environmental Economics']"

The developments in this research field were motivated by some failure cases in the 19th century. The structural failure occurred even if the loading stresses were below the yield point of the material. The reason for that were the elevated temperatures resulting in creep behaviour of the structure. The first theories have been formulated as uniaxial equations with only a few parameters. Later, these equations were extended to three-dimensional equations, substituting the scalar stress and strain by their tensorial counterparts. In addition, for better comparison to one-dimensional results, equivalent statements for the applied stresses were introduced. Up to now, there is no creep mechanics theory which is as strict as continuum mechanics. However, there are many engineering theories through which more and more solutions for practical cases can be obtained. Below, a state of the art report of creep and damage mechanics for metallic materials and structures composed from these materials is given. Some remarks concerning the equivalent stress statements are added. In the further chapters, some parts of this contribution are extended.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Structural Materials', 'Classical and Continuum Physics']"

The practical operation of this sentence is examined through the special case example of Phuong Ngo, who was convicted of the only contract political assassination in Australia and sentenced to life imprisonment in November 2001. The Royal prerogative of mercy as the only potential release mechanism does not offer a reasonable prospect for Ngo’s conditional liberty as it is only exercised in the most extraordinary circumstances—a threshold requirement too vague to be meaningful in practice. One final avenue for possible relief is a communication to the United Nations Human Rights Committee for a remedy requesting legislative repeal or amendment to bring the indeterminate sentence into line with Australia’s international human rights obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . Overall, the ongoing journey in Ngo’s case example highlights that life imprisonment in NSW precludes the attainment of important sentencing principles of proportionality and human dignity.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Human Rights', 'Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law', 'Social Justice, Equality and Human Rights']"

In this chapter, the accounts of sex workers and brothel operators are used to understand how sex work has become increasingly professionalised, both in the context of decriminalisation and the status of sex workers as independent contractors. Building on an international body of research that highlights common rules and norms used to maintain order in brothels, this chapter argues that operators use these to reinforce the status of sex workers as responsibilised professionals. At the same time, there is a tension between professionalisation and the marketing tactic of promoting commercial sexual services as authentic sexual encounters. This functions to limit the extent to which sex workers are able to manage their own labour, rendering them subject both to operators’ requirements of professionalised productivity and the expectations of clients to provide authentic experiences that situate sex work outside a professionalised realm.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime and Society', 'Critical Criminology', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Gender Studies', 'Social Policy', 'Politics of the Welfare State']"

Furthermore, the entropy S is derived as a state variable with which the amount of irreversibility of a change of state can be quantified. For this purpose, the tool of the reversible substitute process is used for adiabatic processes and for non-adiabatic processes. With the entropy S as a state variable, the entropy change of the irreversible processes of friction, temperature equalisation, pressure equalisation and throttling is calculated. In order to understand the nature of entropy, entropy is interpreted e.g. as a measure of the disorder of a system. Isentropic changes of state are discussed and entropy diagrams are introduced in general. Finally, the thermodynamic temperature T is derived via the reversible Carnot process.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

However, at the time of its establishment, Member States representing the major contributors to the ESM have preserved for themselves a priority weight in the decision-making process, opting for a voting system based on capital shares. In fact, the voting rights of each ESM Member are equal to the number of shares allocated to it in the capital stock of the ESM. In this way, Member States economically most affected by the crisis accepted, due to their lower bargaining power, the institutionalisation of unequal treatment in order to benefit from the various ESM lending instruments. This weighted voting system creates inequality among ESM Members and the recent Agreement Amending the ESM Treaty seems not to be able to exceed this criticism. Starting from these premises, this paper will attempt to propose corrective measures to the ESM voting system with the aim of establishing the primacy of the principle of equality in its decision-making process.","['Law', 'Public International Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'European Law', 'Human Rights', 'Dispute Resolution, Mediation, Arbitration', 'International Criminal Law']"

Forces in the dynamics of the variables may depend on time, position of the body, and its velocity. You can come to the concept of inertia if you want to compare the results of the action of one force with different bodies. The property of bodies to change their speed faster or slower under the action of applied forces is called inertia. A quantitative measure of inertia is the mass of a body (a measure of the gravitational properties of a body). The mass of this body will be considered constant (with the exception of specially discussed cases). To distract from the shape of the body, the concept of a material point is introduced. A material point is a material body that has a mass, the size of which can be ignored when studying motion. In dynamics, a body moving translationally can be considered a material point. Dynamics are based on the laws that Newton laid out in 1687. These three laws are also called the Galileo-Newton axioms, since the first law was discovered by Galileo in 1638.","['Physics', 'Classical Mechanics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Complexity', 'Classical and Continuum Physics', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Engineering Design']"

Thereby, some of the most tangible achievements of supranational integration were called into question, including the abolition of internal border controls in the Schengen area and free movement of workers and EU citizens. Against this background, EU institutions and Member States have put into practice a crisis response that may be described as coordinative Europeanization. On the one hand, this approach preserves Member States’ wide latitude to adopt measures for the purpose of safeguarding public health. On the other hand, it establishes an intense mode of coordination among national decision-makers, which has contributed to the streamlining and gradual reduction of border closures and travel restrictions in practice. While this crisis response may thus be viewed as a success, it did not preclude the resumption of uncoordinated measures in the light of new variants of the virus. Thus, the question may be raised whether such a crisis response may merely resemble a fair-weather arrangement. The present contribution will answer in the negative, focussing especially on the discursive impact that coordinative Europeanization generates for national decision-makers. In this respect, it is argued that, despite relatively weak legal instructions, coordinative Europeanization has motivated national decision-makers to duly consider the supranational implications of their actions, even in the context of relative uncertainty surrounding new variants of Covid-19.","['Geography', 'Cultural Geography', 'Political Sociology']"

Its objective is to understand key characteristics of these incidents across the country. The results of the analysis from a previous investigation of officer homicide cases that occurred in the Caracas Metropolitan Area (AMC) during 2013 serve as background to contrast the results observed in the same area in 2016. The general characteristics of the AMC cases are then juxtaposed with those of the rest of the country. Among the main findings are that most police victims of homicide were not on duty, not in uniform and not identifiable as officers at the time of the incident. While they typically carried their firearms, this did not save their lives; on the contrary, on occasions it heightened the risk of the situation. The empirical evidence found largely contradicts dominant media and political discourse regarding the deaths of State security force officials.

It shows that, rather than being a mechanism through which states fulfil their obligation to protect a people’s fair access to opportunities for self-determination, autonomy is merely a vehicle through which minority rights are administered. While the accommodation of national minorities in Romania is considered to be a positive example, a focus on the Hungarian minority highlights the extent to which the group’s autonomy has become entrenched in a nexus of dependence, involving both the home-state and the kin-state. I argue that the exercise of autonomy in cases such as the one discussed here is at odds with legal and political developments concerning the concept of autonomy for minority groups in Europe. This has not only weakened autonomy’s normative foundations but also, more worryingly, caused it to become evanescent.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Comparative Politics', 'Language Policy and Planning', 'Governance and Government', 'Political Science']"

While there is often legal recognition of their existence, necessary material commitment to their fulfilment can often be lacking. In these instances, litigation for the enforcement of socio-economic rights provides an opportunity for State accountability and subsequent necessary action. Unfortunately, the judicial arm of government in these countries are not always responsive to their roles in the fulfilment of socio-economic rights and may be unduly hesitant to hold State parties accountable. This chapter examines the role of the judiciary in the realisation of socio-economic rights in South Africa and Nigeria, through a comparative analysis of the approach of the courts. We argue that the judiciary must be inclined to make progressive rulings if the aims of socio-economic rights are to be met. We suggest therefore that, while existing legislative frameworks are important for framing the judicial responses to socio-economic cases brought before them, judicial interpretation of those laws depends on the willingness of the judiciary to be progressive. To this end, the determination of the possibilities for realising socio-economic right cannot be constrained simply to law in the books but must include an analysis of how those laws are interpreted in context. We argue that the willingness of the judiciary to be progressive in their adjudication of socio-economic rights will be largely dependent on their own conception of their role in the democratic and political process of their country, and how that role is to be fulfilled vis a vis the other arms of government and their own roles.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'African Politics']"

To avoid the problem of the singularity of Euler angles, the equation of state is written in terms of quaternions. The control laws are designed and evaluated in the following three cases: (1) The case where only the attitude error calculation of the control law using the Euler angle is modified. (2) The case where the vector part of the quaternion is used as the control variable. (3) The case where the vector part of the error quaternion is used as the control variable.

D’Argenson argues in his Considerations sur le gouvernement that a modern administration must be democratized in order to be able to act efficiently and close to the citizen on the one hand and to strengthen local freedoms in the spirit of Montesquieu on the other. Rousseau combines in his work the theorem of popular sovereignty, as he saw it completed in the constitutional state, with d’Argenson's approach and called for the democratization of government and administration. All three concepts became important when the US struggled to create a new federal republic. They were not used in France. Instead, revolutionaries here believed that the survival of the state depended on their ability to shape the general will of the nation. In this sense, they remained true to republican models and did not draw on the incipient theory of democracy .","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Political Theory', 'Political History', 'Political Science', 'Cultural History', 'Constitutional Law']"

After an introduction including a historiographical analysis on the neglect of democracy in Sidney studies, this chapter is split into four main parts. First, as Discourses cannot be fully understood without reference to its polemical target, I outline the anti-democratic arguments found in Sir Robert Filmer’s Patriarcha, or The Natural Power of Kings (1680). In the second part, I offer a textual study of democracy as it appears in Discourses , unpicking some of the nuances and rationale behind Sidney’s own anti-democratic statements. Thirdly, I reconstruct the broader framework of Sidney’s republicanism to suggest, despite major tensions, how Discourses does incline to democratic power and democracy, even in Sidney’s own words. Finally, however, I demonstrate significant and insidious exclusionary dimensions to Sidney’s politics. I conclude with some reflections on the perils and potentialities of a Sidneian republic.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Political Theory', 'Political History', 'Political Science', 'Cultural History', 'Constitutional Law']"

As such, its success depends on how balanced these constraints are. These elements are interrelated, as any change in one of them will affect the others. Managing delays is very crucial in the construction industry because failing to finish the project on time could affect the stakeholders’ interests. One of the most controversial type of delays in construction is the concurrent delay. The main aim of this research is to perform a comprehensive comparison between the different technics of concurrent delays analysis in order to create an analytical model to identify concurrency delays and the party responsible for them. The different technics presented in this research are the Association for the advancement of cost engineering 2011, the Society of Construction Law 2017, and the American Society of civil engineers 2016 being the most internationally recognized protocols in dealing with construction delays. In addition, different countries’ laws including the Egyptian Civil Law, the English Law and the US Law are also discussed as examples of different courts dealing with concurrency. Moreover, the FIDIC 2017 and NEC3 are also highlighted as standard forms of contracts dealing with concurrency.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

The secondary objective is to identify a better way to improve the social and economic positions of these residents through further integration into Japanese society. We believe that the potential for them to become a vital bridge between the two countries in the near future is significant, but that potential is not yet being tapped sufficiently. Therefore, the goal of this analysis is more than simply improving working and living conditions, but of promoting career development in Japanese society. To that end, educational background is highly important, especially education and acquisition of the Japanese language beginning in primary school is of utmost importance. For this reason, our paper focuses on the basic education (especially Japanese language education) of Brazilian children in Japan. We conclude that the style of “afterschool” is most efficient as well as socially equitable. We propose a public policy to be adopted by the Japanese government to induce Brazilian families to adopt the hybrid afterschool education system.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'International Relations Theory', 'International Relations', 'International Economics', 'Globalization', 'Diplomacy']"

Data for the study was collected from secondary and primary sources. The secondary data were collected from the Palestinian SAIs’ annual and the interim specialized reports from year 2011 to 2020. Moreover, the study employed the questionnaire survey to know the perception of the CPAs who licensed and in the public practice of the audit profession in Palestine on the role of the SAIs on the audit quality in the municipalities, in order to support the result of the analysis of the SAIs audit reports. The study uses SPSS Software 20 in order to analyze the collected data by the questionnaire. The study finds that the SAIs have a medium impact on the relationship between the audit quality and the effective internal control components, as well as the auditors’ characteristics, but SAIs have weakness impact on the audit firm’s attributes. The findings of the study may help the policymakers in the municipalities, SAIs, profession regulators, and the audit firms to consider the impact of auditing of SAIs on external audit quality in the municipalities when they decide on the audit engagement’s agreement and audit process. Moreover, the study opens the doors to the academic researchers to examine effect of SAIs on the relationship between the audit quality and other audit quality attributes and use other research methods.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

It finds that four types of market failures may arise as a result of takeovers: increase of market power (potential monopoly), severe information asymmetries, negative externalities, and undersupply of public goods. The market failure problems may affect three types of societal interests: (i) the interests of corporate stakeholders with whom target companies have a contractual relationship, (ii) the legally recognized public interest considerations, and (iii) other societal interests affected by a takeover. To address the market failures and protect the relevant societal interests, regulatory frameworks of takeovers are established in different jurisdictions, which consist of both government regulation and private regulation.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Corporate Governance', 'Finance, general']"

The functional and structural divisions between the three branches of government in every democratic state are embedded in the concept of separation of powers. South Africa having negotiated a new constitution that gave birth to a constitutional democracy in postapartheid, the idea of separation and balancing of power was ingrained into the laws enacted by the state. Despite the misgivings surrounding the practical application of the concept, the country has made some strides in defending the letter and spirit of the 1996 Constitution by upholding the doctrine of separation of power and rule of law through a functioning government, independent judiciary, and effective parliament. Thus, this chapter unpacked the commitment of South Africa toward the tenets of separation of power. The study highlighted that the institutional and procedural structures have inspired cooperative government and checks and balances among the branches of government. Moreover, the structural and procedural partitions of public powers coupled with oversight responsibilities and veto powers have increased the assurance of the public in the three branches of government. The study emphasized that the emerging democracy in South Africa could be further consolidated if the branches of government remain committed to the tenets of separation of power.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'African Politics', 'Comparative Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Public Policy', 'Electoral Politics', 'Public Administration']"

It is precisely through law, in fact, that the complexity of human relations unfolds: rules come from men and works in their function, in order to grasp their interests and needs. At the beginning, the Community was governed by a new and naive complex of precepts and ideal principles, which main goal was to create a well organised community life. Forty years later, the legal system of Damanhur became an articulated system of normative sources, hierarchically subordinate to the fundamental law, the X Constitution of Damanhur, approved in 2007. The regulations’ evolution has been accompanied by a parallel transformation of Damanhur’s government system, which changed from a primordial centralization of legislative, executive and judicial powers handle by the founder, Oberto Airaldi, and a small circle of his disciples, to a rapid evolution in a democratic key. Even today, Damanhur does not adopt the tripartition of powers theorized by Montesquieu, but its system is characterized by leaving to the electorate, enlarged or restricted, depending on the case, the appointment of the King/Queen Guides and the members of the College of Justice, who remain in office for short periods, not exceeding the year. An original legal model, analyzing which the Italian Magistrate Bruno Tinti (at the time State Prosecutor at the Tribunal of Turin) declared in 2008: “Damanhur beats us in justice”. Damanhur appears as a small “State within the State” whose sovereignty, however, is not alternative to state one, because for the Italian legal system it’s merely a non-recognized organization.","['Religious Studies', 'Spirituality', 'History of World War II and the Holocaust']"

Decriminalisation has been identified as a key way to reduce exploitation Exploitation , minimise harm and improve working conditions for sex workers, but there has been little research explicitly focused on how far this happens in brothels in New Zealand. Moreover, there has been virtually no literature that looks at how such changes might occur; instead, the assumption is that decriminalisation Decriminalisation promotes the idea that brothels are governed as businesses like any other and that this will be beneficial. The question remains: Can decriminalisation influence the ways that brothels are managed in order to improve sex workers’ working conditions? In this chapter, I draw together the findings from the previous chapters to examine how sex workers are materially impacted by management practices. I argue that the emphasis on inclusion and legitimacy, whilst desirable and beneficial, can disproportionately benefit operators to the detriment of sex workers. As such, I conclude by suggesting better platforms than inclusion for sex workers’ rights and wellbeing are needed to ensure safeguards at work.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime and Society', 'Critical Criminology', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Gender Studies', 'Social Policy', 'Politics of the Welfare State']"

He then addresses the relationships between finance capital and militarism. He contrasts Hilferding’s and Luxemburg’s approach to this issue, provides historical evidence of the connections between finance capital and militarism, and concludes on the relevance of Luxemburg’s analysis of militarism with regard to present-day contemporary capitalism.","['Economics', 'Social Choice/Welfare Economics/Public Choice/Political Economy', 'Political Economy/Economic Systems', 'History of Economic Thought/Methodology', 'European Politics']"

Why a chapter dedicated to this topic? Because previous research into such crimes within Canada has been meagre, hindering the ability to understand which types of heritage are the most at-risk from theft. When any item of tangible heritage is stolen—regardless of value—the impact on history and culture is very real, and every attempt must be taken to avoid this from happening. Exposing the threats facing items of tangible cultural heritage in Canada, by revealing those that have been stolen from museums, is a means of demonstrating the need to improve protection of the nation’s collections. At the outset of this research, the aim was to gather information about thefts of heritage from both media reports and law enforcement. Unfortunately, other than gaining access to the Interpol Stolen Works of Art database, it was not possible to acquire much information from police authorities. Canada lacks a standardised national crime management system, and has only one provincial investigative unit for art and heritage crime, which hinders the ability to obtain this information. Consequently, the study also demonstrates the need to establish a Canadian federal team (or at least more provincial units) specialised in the investigation of crimes relating to cultural heritage.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Cultural Heritage', 'Archaeology', 'Organized Crime']"

Natural opposition to the idea of all British officers being armed comes from rights groups, primarily concerned about the right to life implications for victims: not only in the greater risk of arbitrary killing by the State but also the impunity for offending officers. This reticence about the routine arming of the police reflects the classic liberal belief that citizens must be protected from the actions of the State, especially where fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, are threatened. But does this traditional approach unduly monopolise the human rights debate? The purpose of this piece is to explore conceptual arguments relating to the right to life: has the traditional approach to the right, largely concentrated on the arbitrary killing of civilians, unfairly dominated the rights discourse?

In Moldavia, only one trial from 1761 is known, which is carefully placed in the context of the magical beliefs and practices of Moldavian population of the past centuries. Wallachia offers a much richer harvest of witchcraft cases between 1586 and 1859, with three executions for witchcraft, but which had an obvious political substratum. At the end of the chapter, an interpretation model inspired by risk-management theory is applied, on three levels, in order to highlight some contextual specificities of Romanian culture: the institutional level (implicitly that of legislation), the community level and the intrapersonal level (the last being an essentially subjective one, encompassing the feelings of each individual).","['History', 'European History', 'Cultural History', 'Social History']"

The chapter explains the important role that debates about the future of the death penalty have played in understanding policies towards life imprisonment in Asia in particular. It shows how the complexity of life imprisonment has been reflected in the way it is defined in Asian countries. These definitions are largely a product of the colonial history of the countries concerned. The chapter also summarises what is now known about the process of imposing and enforcing life imprisonment across Asia, and the extent to which this knowledge is supported by statistics, as well as by evidence of how life-sentenced prisoners are treated in practice. Finally, the chapter considers the use that is made of international human rights standards in critiquing the life imprisonment regimes in many Asian countries. It concludes that, while there is a lively policy debate about life imprisonment in Asia, knowledge of what is happening on the ground is sometimes wanting. This book is a significant first step in addressing that knowledge gap.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Human Rights', 'Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law', 'Social Justice, Equality and Human Rights']"

The Internet provides increasing access to data that would otherwise be hidden and perhaps unknown in geographic locations throughout the world. In the United States, research on medical fraud, political corruption, financial fraud, and white-collar delinquency is aided by information available online. Research on corruption and white-collar crime in China is relatively sparse by comparison due to several factors including the lack of reliable and systematic data sources, which makes the Internet invaluable in gathering important data. Since governments typically dislike broadcasting an image of their country as riddled with upper-class law-breaking and corruption, the Internet allows for an increased democratization of data access. In the 1990s, the Internet provided a wealth of knowledge for research into the Savings & Loans crisis of the 1980s through government documents, regulators’ reports, and contact information for officials at various relevant federal agencies. Two decades later, the Chinese melamine milk scandal was publicized mainly through online social media and western news agencies, both of which were able to discuss a topic censored in local state media.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-19856-4_10,en,Non-Territorial Autonomy and Minority Rights: Impact of the Self-Governing National Communities on Minority Protection in Slovenia,OriginalPaper,"Slovenia’s highly developed system of national minority protection has several distinctive features, one of which is the existence of self-governing national communities (SGNCs) for the Italian and Hungarian communities. The model combines personal and territorial elements in an interesting way: self-governing communities can only be established on ‘ethnically mixed territories’, but they are elected solely by persons registered as belonging to the respective community. There is also a second tier: regional SGNCs, with indirectly elected members representing local SGNCs. Most of their competences (on both levels) fall under the category of ‘shared rule’, i.e. they participate in managing institutions (schools, for instance) or in decision-making by providing consent or opinion, while no state powers (for example, in education or culture) are entirely delegated to these bodies. The SGNCs are deeply entrenched in the Slovenian system of minority protection, but are often taken for granted and are rarely assessed with regard to their real impact. There is no systematic monitoring of their performance, and evidence-tracking of their work is scarce and scattered. Against this background, this paper is based on an analysis of the implementation monitoring of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (FCNM) in Slovenia, and focuses on the issues pertinent to the SGNCs that have appeared in the monitoring so far. The general finding is that, while the institutional position and the formal role of the SGNCs have been acknowledged, their concrete contribution and impact on the implementation of minority rights as indirectly stipulated in the FCNM have been addressed in a rather superficial way. Nevertheless, the monitoring documents offer a valuable insight into the issues pertinent to the functioning of the SGNCs that have attracted attention in almost 25 years of monitoring practice. This paper offers a brief overview of the most striking issues relevant to the functioning of the SGNCs and the implementation of minority rights, as documented in the FCNM monitoring.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Comparative Politics', 'Language Policy and Planning', 'Governance and Government', 'Political Science']"

While existing scholarly assessments highlight central institutional features of the Paris shift, they tend to overlook its symbolic and discursive dimensions. Our analysis shows that the Paris architecture combines two core elements: an iterative pledge and review process to stimulate global climate action, and a ‘performative’ narrative aimed at aligning actors’ expectations on the prospect of a low-carbon future. We therefore suggest calling it an incantatory system of governance. We then examine the origins of the new approach and find that the rise of ‘soft law’ approaches and communicative techniques in global climate governance are both indicative of a broader process: the entry of management culture in international organisations. Against this backdrop, we examine the prospects, limitations and caveats of the new approach and discuss its wider implications for global politics.","['Social Sciences', 'Environmental Policy', 'Political Science and International Relations, general', 'Political Theory', 'Governance and Government', 'International Environmental Law']"

Based on experiences in a large, interdisciplinary research project, the authors rather show how the interdisciplinary of the project changed over time. Drawing on the work of Donna Haraway, Joan Tronto, and Maria Puig de la Bellacasa, interdisciplinarity is explored and conceptualised as a doing of care and an object of care. The authors provide examples of what supported and hampered the doing of such care work. The boundary concept of regulatory ecology advanced both theoretical and methodological development in the project as well as contributed to strengthening relationships and communication within the team. Care work was sometimes hampered by the disciplinary dialects of the participants, which can also result in different interpretations given to metaphors and visualisations. As an object of care, interdisciplinarity requires time for dialogue and critical reflection. The authors show how the disciplinary power of project implementation and deadlines took precedence in the second half of the project, challenging the project’s critical and exploratory edge. Interdisciplinarity needs to be cultivated, to be cared for, which takes time, and which should already be expressed in the project proposal.","['Business and Management', 'Sustainability Management', 'Economic Geography', 'Diversity Management/Women in Business', 'Law and Economics', 'Business Ethics']"

This unprecedented sentence was applied to the perpetrator of the 2019 Christchurch terror attack. Convicted of 51 murders, 40 attempted murders, and one charge of engaging in a terrorist attack, the sentencing of the Christchurch terrorist represented the first use of the most severe sanction available in New Zealand legislation. Considering the public discourse around the sentencing in this case, and the trajectory of the ‘law and order’ conversation in this country over the last three decades, this chapter examines the socio-political context of legislative developments that have affected life and indefinite sentences. While life imprisonment without parole has only been imposed in one case, the use of life imprisonment more generally has remained consistent, while the scope of other indefinite sentences and measures has expanded over time. The number of prisoners held on indefinite sentences has increased considerably over time: now constituting approximately 11% of the total prison population. This paper provides an outline of the use of life imprisonment in New Zealand, and locates it within this growing suite of indefinite sentences and measures available in this country.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Human Rights', 'Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law', 'Social Justice, Equality and Human Rights']"

Section 2 briefly reconstructs the genesis and evolution of participatory democracy in the EU. Section 3 maps out and systematizes the many participatory mechanisms available to EU citizens—from petitions to the EU Parliament, complaints to the European Ombudsman, to European Citizens’ Initiatives—and illustrates how participatory democracy has been elevated to become one of the foundations of democracy in the EU. Section 4 examines the realities of participation by unveiling how current practices are characterized by unequal access, limited representativeness, and ultimately the disparate influence of participants. Section 5 puts forward some recommendations on how to unleash the democratic potential of EU participatory democracy in light of the Conference on the Future of Europe, an unprecedented, institutionally short-lived democratic exercise, but whose consequences should not be underestimated.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Legislative and Executive Politics']"

During the past two decades, inverse analysis methods were developed to determine the true stress–strain behaviors of materials from the load–displacement curve of indentation. Among those methods, many researchers have widely used the representative $$\left( {\varepsilon_{r} } \right)$$ ε r strain approach with dimensional analysis to get the relationships between indentation responses and material properties since it reduces the number of apparent unknown variables in the $$\pi$$ π functions. However, the methods proposed in those studies are valid only for the power-law engineering materials without a plastic plateau in their true stress–strain behavior like most engineering metals. This paper has reviewed the usage of the representative strain approach with spherical indentation to determine the metal properties. In order to develop an inverse analysis method based on spherical indentation in determining the material properties of unknown steel material, the latter part of the paper has focused on exploring the feasibility of using the representative strain approach for power-law engineering materials with a plastic plateau.","['Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Sustainable Development', 'Building Materials', 'Building Construction and Design']"

Currently there is no dedicated police capacity for art crime in Belgium. Belgium nonetheless remains an important link in the international art trade and faces the concomitant illegal activity. This chapter charts the evolution of the Belgian federal police’s Art and Antiques unit and examines how its decreasing resources have impacted art crime policing in the country, particularly with regards to the relationship between the police and private actors. This fact-finding is framed by the criminological theory of fiscal constraint, the basic hypothesis of which is that as public institutions prove unable to meet policing demand, private participation in policing grows, making for a pluralised policing landscape. The chapter aims to highlight challenges to art crime policing in a context where it is given a low priority by public institutions, spotlight the Belgian situation specifically, situate art crime policing in Belgium within broader criminological policing theory, and look towards the future of art crime policing.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Cultural Heritage', 'Archaeology', 'Organized Crime']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-19467-2_4,en,Fishing and Overfishing-Sustainable Harvest of the Sea,OriginalPaper,"The impacts of industrial fishing have been present in the oceans for over one hundred years, but the exponential increase all over the world and the systematic exploitation of different areas started after world war II. The phenomenon of fishing has to be understood in order to understand the changes in the oceans, and such deep transformation is essential to capture the essence of the resilience: the collapse of fish stocks, the lack of biodiversity, and the profound transformation of ecosystems due to overfishing is in part responsible for the ocean’s impacted functioning that we witness today. It now seems that the collapse of many habitats is to blame for rising acidification or temperature, but the reality is that the impact of overfishing on pelagic and benthic systems is largely responsible for the profound transformations we see today. Trawling has devastated entire ecosystems, destroying the complexity of marine forests, both those that are dominated by vegetal organisms (macroalgae and phanerogams) and those dominated by animals (corals, gorgonians, sponges, etc.). It has been possible to verify that it is not only the destruction of the structures, but the compaction of the sediment and the continuous resuspension that made possible the impoverishment of the communities and therefore of the impoverishment of the fishing stocks. Beyond these impacts, pelagic fisheries have seen profound changes in populations, which evolve to the sound of fishing pressure. The minimum size of successful reproduction (i.e. the size in which the fish is lying eggs to promote the continuity of the populations), for example, has been drastically changed in many species, making possible for populations to survive despite the immense pressure of the predator, us. In addition, these fisheries highlight the fact that many animals are trapped with nets and long lines (dolphins, turtles, birds, etc.). The solutions to these problems are sometimes difficult to apply. These large organisms are usually essential for the health status of the ecosystem and the maintenance of the biodiversity, but we are impacting them in such a way that they have become irrelevant from an ecosystem functioning point of view. The so-called by-catch of smaller organisms is another huge problem. Discards (sometimes more than 50% of fisheries) profoundly harm and transform the ecosystem, and are difficult to sell in the fishing market. Solutions have been sought for decades and this collateral damage has been denounced, but there is still a long way to go. There is also a long way to go to eliminate the high percentage (calculated in more than a quarter of the fish landings of the entire planet) of those known as illegal, unreported and unregulated fisheries. This type of mismanagement of the sea is at the heart of the active policies of many countries, but without transparency and transnational actions, it will it will be difficult to reach a good agreement to suppress or minimize them. In fisheries models, apart from direct impacts, the effects of climate change have long been implemented. As already explained in the previous chapter, rising temperatures and the effects of acidification are transforming the landscape of primary and secondary productivity. The most obvious of these changes is the fact that there will be less fishing, and therefore less production. The effect of lower productivity is already felt in several long-lasting time series, where fishing is being affected by the decrease in phytoplankton. But, in addition, there are less obvious effects. One is the substitution of species, because some are more vulnerable than others to the increase in temperature, so that in the same taxonomic and functional group those who are best adapted to the new conditions win. Another is the expansion of invasive species that directly affect the food chain, and that may feel more comfortable with the new “rules” of fisheries impact and climate change. Some animals are already undergoing these changes, such as cetaceans dying of starvation in certain areas where the synergistic effects of fishing and climate change are felt. The co-governance of fisheries, in which scientists, politicians and society work together, is essential to move forward. They are not hollow words; they are real needs in a world of an excessively accelerated change.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-13706-8_3,en,Frege’s Paradox and the Serial Form,OriginalPaper,"At the beginning of Logic of Sense , Deleuze defines paradox as “the affirmation of both senses or directions at once” (“ le paradoxe est l’affirmation des deux sens a la fois ”; LdS 9; LoS 1), and then he elaborates different paradoxes of sense. Thus, there are several aspects on which sense implies the affirmation of two directions at once. This affirmation is crucial to sense. As Paul Livingston in his chapter on Deleuze declares, the paradoxical aspect of sense is connected to the way it underlies becoming: “Sense for Deleuze also underlies the instability of meaning and, even more generally, the phenomena of change, flux, and becoming”, and he continues by claiming that the paradoxical aspect or the “bidirectionality” of sense “is necessary for understanding change and becoming” (Livingston, 2012: 96–97). In this regard, Deleuze’s account of sense is related to the second type of being which Plato recognizes in Parmenides and Philebus : “Pure becoming without measure, a veritable becoming-mad which never rests … and indocile matter” (LdS 9; LoS 1–2). Plato’s examples of these entities are that which is denoted by the words such as “hotter”, “colder” or “younger.” They do not denote the stable and established beings which suppose pauses and rests to be able to receive the action of the Ideas. They denote being as becoming, being as expressing itself in a diversity of modes. And as Plato’s examples indicate, being as becoming appears only in language. It is being as sense, as linguistic sense. The change that Deleuze makes here is replacing Plato’s comparative adjectives with infinitive verbs (this replacement is based on the Stoic reading and will be discussed in detail in next chapter). This replacement entails a move from “becoming” to “the event”.","['Philosophy', 'Ontology', 'Logic']"

Research on Indonesia has shown that the post-Reformasi era witnessed tension escalating between the Muslim majority and the Christian minority. Discrimination has also been a problem along with the government’s reluctance to offer workable solutions. This chapter makes the case that Indonesia’s religious divide is partly a product of its flawed democracy and examines two specific strategies, as practiced by the Christian churches, used to overcome oppression: those that are internal to the community and those that are external and focus on relationships with other groups, both religious and non-religious. We demonstrate that many Christians are striving for a sense of solidarity with their Muslim counterparts and others but that there is still much progress to be made. Finally, this chapter also explores how Indonesia’s Christian community has made attempts to consolidate as a community even while denominations (aliran) continue to emerge along with the larger and more commercialized mega-churches.

These challenges include, but are not limited to, their ongoing involvement with legal systems of international protection, their tenuous immigration status and associated stresses, a lack of support in destination countries, and separation from family members. These experiences, the absence of guaranteed government protections due to selective and hostile asylum regimes in Western countries, and the exclusion of this population from welfare systems result in their precarious legal status. Asylum regulations in a receiving country can impact asylum seekers’ access to essential support and services. Furthermore, experiences of trauma and loss, and liminality caused by protracted application processes, affect the mental health and the well-being of asylum seekers. Because of asylum seekers’ unique challenges and experiences, practitioners require specialized knowledge and skills to support them effectively. This chapter will provide an overview of asylum processes and policies, using the US and European countries as examples. This chapter will also explore these governments’ current responses, common challenges and needs of asylum seekers living in these countries, and best practices and specialized skill social workers who need to support these populations in an integrative way.","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Public Policy', 'Ethics and Values in Social Work']"

The guidance strategy is considered from two stages. One is the cooperative stage, where a cooperative control term is established based on directed leader-follower network, to achieve synchronization on missile-target distances as well as the heading angles of missiles. Moreover, the synchronization achieving time is independent of any other parameters and can be appointed by users. The other is the attack stage, where the conventional proportional navigation guidance (PNG) law takes effect to capture the target cooperatively. The novelty of this guidance strategy lies in that it is the first time to combine the PNG law with appointed-time control framework, such that cooperative attack is realized. Corresponding simulation shows the effectiveness of presented strategy.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Multiagent Systems', 'Systems Theory, Control']"

This chapter explores the working life and worldview of those AFOs who are deployed on-call in armed response vehicles (ARVs). A framework of police legitimacy and self-legitimacy is used to investigate the interactions between AFOs and a public that is unused to seeing armed police. Drawing from over 200 h of ethnographic material gathered whilst observing officers on duty in ARVs across two English police forces, this chapter documents real-life interactions between the public and AFOs. No evidence of a visceral, negative public reaction to armed police is found. However, the on-call ARV model is seen by AFOs as impairing their ability to perform legitimate policing by distancing them from the public. Having the opportunity to interact with the public is affirmatory for AFOs and forms a critical part of their self-legitimacy.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Crime and Society', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Public Health']"

The relationship between the international community and the PA, on the one hand, and between the PA and Israeli clearance revenue on the other, hindered the formation of a stable societal contract between the PA and different segments of Palestinian society. The chapter’s primary argument is that the PA’s commitments to abide by externally imposed conditionalities undermined its inward accountability and hindered its legitimacy. It further shifted the PA’s accountability in favour of rent providers. The resultant state–society relationship was weak, and plagued by authoritarianism, lack of political institutions, mistrust, and competition. The evolution of a social contract based on taxation and representation was further undermined by the PA’s weak domestic legitimacy.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Middle Eastern Politics']"

Legislative Gender Representation in Germany at a Crossroads,OriginalPaper,"A century after the introduction of women’s suffrage in Germany, representation in the Bundestag still exhibits a substantial gender gap with about a third of parliamentarians being women. Given that Germany was an early adopter of party quotas, their overall effectiveness is being called into question. We examine to what degree the implementation of party quotas succeeded and where and why it failed. Amending existing literatures on quotas in German politics that focus primarily on party adoption, recruitment practices, and actor-level engagement with quotas, we highlight the relevance of institutional and political factors that inhibit the implementation of party quotas. We submit that the centrist German parties practice a culture of minimalist compliance and only the left and green parties implement their quotas rigorously. As party quotas might have run their course in Germany, there is a growing movement demanding legislative quotas within a parity law. The chapter draws on gendered candidate and election data, on party statutes of federal and state party organizations, and on interviews with party officials and party women’s organizations.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Politics and Gender', 'Gender Studies', 'Comparative Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Public Administration']"

The process often relies on multiple local and remote participants that use numerous financial institutions and complex instruments to obfuscate the trail and origin of illicit funds. The use of the Internet, combined with cryptocurrency and blockchain development, has enabled money launderers to expand their activities into cyberspace. Cyber laundering provides quick, easy, low-cost, anonymous transactions and circumvents traditional detection techniques used by the authorities. In contrast to traditional money laundering, cyber money laundering is relatively new, and cryptocurrency and the blockchain make it technically complex. The inherent complexity and reach of the technology have contributed to in-cohesive and fragmented regulatory and enforcement structures across jurisdictions. This chapter presents an overview and comparison of traditional and cyber money laundering methods and operationally compares traditional and cyber money laundering. The work also covers existing legal and regulatory frameworks, identifies areas of necessary improvement, and proposes potential technical and nontechnical anti-cyber laundering remedies.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security']"

Methods of repression have varied over time, but it is striking that strategies of open or tacit discrimination and expulsion of the Roma are still found in some contemporary policies of the older and transitional democracies, in EU Member States and countries that are candidates for EU membership. Of major concern is the fact that xenophobic statements and actions against the Roma often come from leading politicians or from national governments. Additionally, despite various international and regional human rights instruments, the ongoing structural discrimination that the Roma face has not yet been addressed within the existing legal framework. Many of the measures that have been proposed to address social exclusion and marginalisation are largely unenforceable; they tend to overlook the harsh living conditions, lack of access to public services, low level of education and embedded prejudice against the Roma. This paper addresses the human rights violability of cultures commonly marginalised in society. In many cases, although human rights protection regimes are enacted for certain cultures, the measures do not encompass groups that are non-dominant and territorially dispersed. The case of the Roma exemplifies not only this situation in respect of their language, cultural and educational rights in Spain and in North Macedonia, but also how the establishment and implementation of possible non-territorial autonomy (NTA) arrangements can help to overcome lasting discrimination. There is no unique model of NTA since it is applied differently in different contexts and circumstances. However, in essence, NTA arrangements can help minorities to enjoy cultural or other activities without territorial limitation. NTA can thus support the protection of territorially dispersed cultures and alleviate some of the harsh practices that they face.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Comparative Politics', 'Language Policy and Planning', 'Governance and Government', 'Political Science']"

Departing from Giorgio Agamben’s reading of the state of exception, it will be argued that public order is the legal dispositive allowing for sovereign power to disseminate in a microphysical form throughout the judicial, administrative and securitarian institutions of the state. Moreover, in a similar vein that the state of exception constitutes, for Agamben, a threshold between the order of the law and the order of life, it will be shown that public order represents a fundamental core of Eurocentric regulations of the social life of kinship, gender, and reproduction. Finally, I will contrast the biopolitics of public order, understood as a preserving force for the status quo, with Foucault’s account of friendship, understood as an ever-emerging impulse for creative forms of radical cohabitation.","['Social Sciences', 'Gender and Sexuality', 'Family', 'Sociology of Citizenship']"

This paper considers the Levellers, John Milton, and James Harrington, arguing that while they shared assumptions of popular sovereignty and electoral representation, they can be placed at very different positions on a spectrum between the poles of democracy and republicanism. Their very different constitutional proposals reveal different fears and different attitudes to the role the people should play within a representative system. While the Levellers proposed a clearly democratic system (in modern terms), they also expected an active and spirited people to keep representatives in check. Milton’s constitutional suggestions on the eve of the Restoration show the people as the threat and an aristocratic republicanism as at least a temporary defence. Harrington overtly embraced both the idea of ‘democracy’ and the heritage of the more aristocratic ancient and contemporary republics, forging a remarkable fusion of the two in spite of the anti-democratic elements present in early modern republicanism.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Political Theory', 'Political History', 'Political Science', 'Cultural History', 'Constitutional Law']"

Apparently, social medias are found convenient, effective, and less expensive to market political agendas and to reach out voters easily. Particularly, they are ideal to attract young voters who have low interest in politics because of ease of generating contents, commenting and reflecting on posts, ease of sharing contents to large audience breaking down barriers to freedom of expression. Data for the study were gathered through domain expert involved focus group discussion (FGD). Thematic analysis approach was used to generate themes and insights from the data. The study reveals interesting results on two key relevant issues: media law and individual rights. From the perspectives of media law and policy, the study uncovered paucity and loopholes connected to nurturing a culture of constructive critique on political matters, the need to have sound communication policy at all key governmental institutions, weak regulatory system in terms of crafting and enforcing relevant media laws, the tendency of demeaning accountability on the side of social media companies and social media users, the need to explore legal and diplomatic pressures on social media companies to discharge their corporate social responsibilities by protecting the platform they have developed not to be used to incite conflict, violence, and human right abuses. With regard to upholding fundamental human rights, social medias have provided great opportunities to the general public to easily air out their views and promote political agendas they support. Social medias also paved the way to realize freedom of speech, which presupposes orderly liberty that do not grant a license to threaten individual’s existential rights opening the door for gross human right violations.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This research emphasizes the role of the main actors of the OSCE debate who try to securitize and de-securitize the concerns in the Western Balkan region in the light of the Regional Security Complex Theory. It draws attention to the role that the EU, US, and the Russian Federation have played in the politico-military dimension debate, starting from 1995 when the OSCE was established until 2001 when the turmoil in the region came to an end, as well as in the human dimension debate, beginning from 2015 when Serbia was the first Western Balkan country to chair the organization until 2020 and the Albanian OSCE Chairmanship. The research argues that the two most pressing concerns during the first timeframe, where securitization from regional actors can be addressed, were in the field of arms control and border management. In contrast, in the second timeframe, which is mainly characterized by de-securitization, the attention of the main actors concerning the region is centred on democratization and rule of law.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'International Security Studies', 'Terrorism and Political Violence', 'Political Science', 'Development Studies', 'Comparative Politics']"

Different manipulators models can be uploaded in the GUI to then automatically run the non-linear optimization process and retrieve a minimum-energy trajectory. As an instance, a 6 Degrees of Freedom IM has been considered; the obtained results have been compared with other methods known from the literature and validated through a commercial tool.

Although today fertility is low in the majority of countries, significant differences persist. In this article, I study club convergence of fertility in 190 countries over the period 1950 to 2018. First, I apply a novel econometric method for convergence analysis and club clustering. I find no evidence of global fertility convergence, and I classify the 190 countries into four clubs. I further classify countries into two clubs at the beginning of the period and identify a club of countries transitioning from high to low fertility. Second, I interpret fertility convergence clubs as a feature of the long-term process of economic development and estimate an ordered probit model of the probability that a country enters one of three clubs characterized by high, medium, and low barriers to global fertility convergence. Here, the focus is on ancestral fundamental factors of diversity in economic development. Estimates show a statistically significant inverted U-shaped relationship between interpersonal population diversity and the probability of lower barriers, consistent with the literature on diversity and development. Estimates also highlight that genetic distance to the USA and years since the Neolithic transition to agriculture cause higher barriers to fertility decline.","['Economics', 'Population Economics', 'Labor Economics', 'Demography', 'Social Policy']"

Its first mid-term (five-year) strategy for the development of the linguistic rights of Hungarians was adopted in 2012, its primary goal being to improve the legal background for official communication in minority languages in general in the country, to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the application of the relevant rules by the public authorities and to develop the linguistic awareness of Hungarian national minorities by raising their awareness of language rights. These strategic goals were supported by a range of programmes primarily focused on information, financing, providing law enforcement and assistance, etc.; some of them were copied by other minority councils in Serbia as examples of good practice. The second Linguistic Rights Strategy was adopted in 2021, after a delay of a few years. Besides containing similar provisions as the first document from 2012, with respect to strategic programmes in the field of official communications, its subject matter also covers some other spheres, such as the use of Hungarian in education, information or culture, and it relies much more on the benefits of information technology. Because each strategy is only worth as much as it has accomplished, this paper aims to present and critically analyse the valid Linguistic Rights Strategy of the HNMC in light of its possible practical implications in the future, with special regard to the existing experience gained during the realisation of the previous strategy.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Comparative Politics', 'Language Policy and Planning', 'Governance and Government', 'Political Science']"

Although blockchain technology is evolving and is in its nascent stage, the financial world has started relying upon it and is heavily investing in blockchain applications. In such a scenario, there is every possibility of its being misused and used for illicit purposes like money laundering, hacking, privacy breach, Ponzi investment scheme, terrorist financing, etc. Keeping this in view, this paper aims to explore how blockchain technology is used in the financial sector and analyse the legal implications thereof. For this, the chapter will explain what blockchain technology is, how it is being applied in the financial sector, need for regulation, and lastly, draw conclusions and suggest a few corrective measures.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Sociology, general', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Machine Learning']"

Centre for Transnational Development and Collaboration, London, 2017) have resulted in the forced migration of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) people, particularly from the Global South to the Global North. This chapter provides a brief historical overview of the relationship between colonial regimes and the criminalization of nonnormative sexualities and genders, particularly within the Global South, as well as the emergence of the legal recognition of LGBTQI+ migrants in Canada and the United States, with a particular focus on sexual orientation, gender identity and expression (SOGIE)-based refugee claims. There will be an exploration of post-migration policy challenges and structural barriers faced by sexual and gender minority (SGM) migrants, with a focus on asylum-seekers. This chapter also explores both micro- and macrofactors that shape pre- and post-forced migration experiences of SGM migrants, including initial reflections on the impacts of COVID-19. In addition to highlighting key frameworks addressed in the literature regarding practice with LGBTQI+ migrants, an in-depth case study of an LGBTQI+ migrant health clinic will be presented to highlight the ways in which social workers and directly impacted people can contribute to an innovative model of integrated service delivery. Thus, this chapter aims to present approaches, models, knowledge, skills, and strategies to engage in integrative social work practice with LGBTQI+ migrants, including advancing policy change and advocacy strategies.","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Public Policy', 'Ethics and Values in Social Work']"

Through document analysis and qualitative data from semi-structured interviews, this study maps UNESCO’s engagement with Syria throughout the ongoing armed conflict and identifies the form the organisation’s heritage protection initiatives took. Analysis of such heritage protection initiatives showed UNESCO’s interventions in Syria to be majorly technocratic, with minimal on-the-ground implementation of emergency measures. Moreover, due to political gridlock resultant of the standpoints of other Member States, UNESCO was often unable to act in Syria, with communication lines at times, being completely closed. This political gridlock, which is evidenced to paralyse UNESCO, is often shown to result in the organisation overstating its ability to safeguard heritage, with promises not being followed up with action.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Cultural Heritage', 'Archaeology', 'Organized Crime']"

Yet, despite the long history of unarmed policing in Britain, terror attacks in the UK and Europe and a putative rise in serious violent crime have led to an increase in the deployment of firearms officers and calls for the routine arming of more police. In this chapter we present findings from an online study exploring reactions to armed police among the British public. Participants were presented with a series of images of armed and unarmed police and were asked to make a number of judgements about the officers in the images. We test five sets of predictors of reactions to armed police: prior levels of trust in police, political orientation, social identification, worry about crime and terrorism and socio-demographic factors. We find that trust, political orientation and ethnicity were the strongest predictors of reactions to armed police: those who trust the police and have authoritarian or right-wing political orientations respond more positively to armed police, whereas those from Black and Mixed ethnic groups respond less positively. We conclude by outlining some of the wider implications of our findings.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Crime and Society', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Public Health']"

Women in India are leaders of varied sectors of businesses and on top leadership positions except in IT companies. This study has found that 14 out of 25 leading IT companies in India has, got not more than two women on the board of directors. It has also been found that the reasons for said nomination are due to the statutory compulsion to have women on board. Information technology companies are responsible for innovation, business growth, transformation and diversification. Strategic leadership is the key for IT companies to achieve the above-stated objectives. Inclusiveness in the economic reforms is possible when women are given adequate representation in entrepreneurship Entrepreneurship and leadership positions in all sectors of industries. This study aims at examining the causes of the inadequate representation of women in Indian IT companies. Paper has examined the following issues to analyse the above-stated proposition: (a) How far the Indian IT industry has contributed to the empowerment of Indian women? (b) Whether the employment terms and recruitment policies of IT companies are sufficient to ensure the security of tenure and promotion to women employees and do it incentives women employees’ contribution towards innovation in their respective companies? (c) What are the factors contributing to women taking up leadership positions in Non-IT Industries? (d) Whether family commitments are the reasons for women in the IT sector to decline leadership positions or whether male domination is a cause for women to be backward in IT companies’ leadership positions? (e) Should mandatory reservation of adequate percentage of seats for women in administration be uniformly applied also for employment of women in the IT sector and how far the practice followed in developed jurisdictions need to be incorporated under the Indian law Law ? Enrolment of women in IT and business education is on par with their counterparts. Since women occupying leadership positions is negligible, the paper examines the challenges and proposes solutions to ensure gender equitable reforms in the leadership roles of Indian IT companies. Data related to board composition and shareholding patterns of Indian IT companies are looked into and analysed to identify whether women possess capital or management control in the Indian IT companies. To critique the role of women in other sectors of employment with that of the IT companies, data collected from the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) and Indian government-sponsored schemes are considered. The data are also collected from various sources such as Sustainability Sustainability Reports of Wipro, Infosys, HCL, Dell, Accenture, Tata, Human Development Index (HDI), United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA). The data compiled reflect the factors that affect women’s career progression in the Indian IT sector. This study has found that there is an absolute imbalance in terms of gender diversity on the boards of Indian IT companies. Reasons for the same are as follows: 1. Women who have excelled in technological education are not willing to take up leadership positions in IT companies due to the challenges and risks Risk involved in this specific sector, 2. Family commitments and health issues are not conducive for women to dedicate the required time in managing corporate boards of IT companies, 3. Joint families and a patriarchal Indian system limits woman to undertake employment, 4. Women with liberal outlook and merit are not preferred as a choice by male leaders of IT companies due to the fact that they never want to be led by women, 5. The upskilling programmes organized by IT companies to their women employees are not sufficiently focused to promote women to leadership positions and 6. Excess share qualification for directorship prescribed by listed public companies is an impediment for women to be considered for executive positions. Paper suggests strategies and policies for the promotion of women employees to executive positions and ensuring the disclosure of diversity of corporate boards as a prerequisite to listing its shares. Secondly, it proposes to amend Companies Act, 2013 to prescribe a higher number of mandatory appointments of women on board to make it mandatory for women to be part of committees of the board mandated under the Companies Act. Thirdly, it proposes that the B-Schools admission policies should increase the intake of women candidates for management programmes so that they would possess the adequate competency to govern corporate boards of Indian IT companies.","['Business and Management', 'Business and Management, general', 'Business Ethics', 'Sustainable Development', 'Corporate Governance']"

Some of the risk parameters that can be identified, such as lack of knowledge of traffic regulations, inadequate driving skills, different seasons, and general attitudes towards traffic safety that are reflected in driving behaviour. Along with the development of tourism, the number of foreign motorcyclists also increases. Therefore, the safety measures are essential. In this research, we study the influence of local road and traffic conditions, the influence of local motorcyclists and law enforcement on the behaviour of foreign motorcyclists around tourism areas in Bali. The method used is Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The expected contribution is a model that finds the dominant factors influencing foreign motorcyclists’ behaviour, which can significantly reduce the risk of accidents involving foreigners. The results are the local road and traffic factors affect foreign motorcyclists’ behaviour with a bootstrapping value of 2.426. And local motorcyclists and law enforcement also affect with a bootstrapping number of 3.874. Both factors positively affect foreign motorcyclists’ behaviour with a coefficient of 0.217 and 0.371. The research concluded that the behaviour of foreign motorcyclists in tourist areas in Bali is highly influenced by the behaviour of local motorcyclists and law enforcement by authorized officials. It shows that the more stringent enforcement of the law, the better the behaviour of foreign motorcyclists. Additionally, road and traffic conditions also affect the behaviour of foreign motorcyclists. The better foreign motorcyclists’ behaviour will reduce the risk of accidents.","['Energy', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Construction Management', 'Facility Management']"

There may be times, however, when deadly force might be expected by the public. For example, as first responders to terrorist and active shooter events, officers are expected to quickly end the confrontation, and deadly force may be the only option available. Contemporary scholarship, however, does not explore the public’s view of when the use of deadly force is acceptable or expected. This chapter offers an exploratory examination of when deadly force is acceptable to the American public. A vignette research design was used that described an active shooter event, integrating four contextual dimensions that might influence the use of deadly force. A convenience sample of college students responded to an online survey to explore the public’s views of the need to use deadly force. Results indicate that respondents receiving vignettes in which the officer uses deadly force, rather than not, are more likely to agree with this behavior. Further, non-White students are less likely to agree with the immediate use of deadly force.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Crime and Society', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Public Health']"

Then, joining the Bologna Process in 2005 was a major further step towards integration within the European Higher Education Area.

The recent application of a remote sensing technique called lidar enables the mapping of the ground surface in forested regions, which has been revolutionary for Maya archaeology. In addition to the thousands of archaeological features visible in lidar imagery, lidar also shows the devastating impacts of looting on Maya archaeological sites. This chapter revisits the looting of La Corona in light of new lidar data, combining geospatial analyses and an in-depth review of archaeological excavation records from 2005–2019. Through this preliminary analysis of looting at La Corona, we aim to demonstrate the immense potential of lidar for understanding looting practices in the Maya region.","['Law', 'Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law', 'Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Cultural Heritage', 'Archaeology', 'Organized Crime']"

These ‘face composites’ are typically circulated to law enforcement officers and made accessible to the public in the hope that someone familiar with the depicted person will recognise their likeness and thus provide the police with a suspect. We will review methods for constructing such likenesses from memory dating back to the portrait parlé of Alphonse Bertillon (Signaletic instructions including the theory and practice of anthropometrical identification. Werner Company, 1896) and the composite images of Francis Galton (Nature 18:97-100, 1878). We will also review more modern methods, ranging from the overlay techniques of Identi-Kit (McDonald, c 1959) and Photo-Fit (Penry J. The Police Journal 43:307, 1970) to feature-based computerised composite systems such as Identi-Kit 2000, FACES, and ProMat. Most early systems were based on the common-sense notion that sectioning a face is invertible: just as a face can be sectioned into components, so it can be recreated by arrangements of sections. This assumption appears to be unwarranted. The underlying problem with earlier face systems may have been the absence of a representational or computational theory. This led in the late 1990s to the development of the so-called third-generation holistic composite systems, which are based on underlying statistical and mathematical models of face images (e.g. ID [Tredoux et al. South African Computer Journal 2006:90–97, 2006], EvoFIT [Frowd CD, Hancock PJB, & Carson D. ACM Transactions on Applied Psychology (TAP) 1:1-21, 2004a], E-FIT [Gibson et al., International Conference on Visualisation, 146–151, 2003]). A special focus of the chapter will be on these newer technologies and other recent technological innovations. Our approach will be to review (i) the methods of operation, (ii) the techniques identified by psychologists and other researchers for improving the quality of information obtained from memory, and (iii) the empirical data on the effectiveness of these systems at representing faces from memory. We will consider related issues, too, including the question of whether face composites damage witness memory, and the ethics of face composition.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Anatomy', 'Medical Education', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Visualization', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Computers and Education']"

The authors chose many research methods, including general scientific methods (synthesis, induction, deduction, analysis, system-structural method, hermeneutic method, and synergetic method) and special legal methods (comparative legal method). The study revealed a lack of unity in the understanding of the term “artificial intelligence.” European standards for the development of information technology in the judicial sphere were identified. Moreover, the authors noted the importance of human control over all actions of artificial intelligence. Additionally, the authors identified areas of application of artificial intelligence in Russian legal proceedings and the prospects for further implementation of this legal phenomenon. The authors reached the following conclusions. The gradual introduction of digital technology helps optimize, simplify, and save financial, time, and labor costs in the process of conducting legal proceedings. Artificial intelligence will make it possible to free law enforcement officers and the court apparatus from the repetitive and routine processes typical of the various stages of the legal proceedings. Moreover, it will promote the implementation of transparency, openness, and accessibility of the judicial process. There is a clear auxiliary nature of the activities of artificial intelligence, which is not identical to the full implementation of justice by robots. An electronic system with artificial intelligence must be programmed so that its activities are based on the principles of limited, selective, and prioritized human decisions.","['Business and Management', 'Business Strategy/Leadership', 'Management', 'Economic Growth', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Asian Economics', 'International Organization']"

By exploring the media theory constructs of priming and the copycat effect, we suggest that depictions of police gun violence, which are overwhelmingly positive, contribute to a widespread misunderstanding of policing and the role of violence within policing. We argue that the valorisation of police gun violence on screen is not harmless. It runs counter to well-established and often-codified obligations on police to use minimum levels of force in all circumstances and helps create unrealistic and undesirable public expectations of how police are armed and go about their work and especially of how critical incidents should be resolved. We suggest that WPP should be banned, or at least better regulated, and that classification schemes should be changed to ensure that depictions of policing conform to the doctrine of minimum force. We also suggest that police agencies use their influence over screen producers to ensure that depictions of policing are framed by the minimum force doctrine. (This chapter expands our examination of WPP in ‘“The Devil’s Right Hand”: Policing, Media and Weapons Product Placement’ (Evans and Farmer. Do police need guns?: Policing and firearms: Past, present and future.

Semantics and choice contingency lead to the possibility of error as well as to knowledge, through many-to-one (or many to a few) mappings. This is why the universe is always ambiguous. Knowledge both creates and attempts to limit that ambiguity. Agency as self-constraint is immensely complex compared to spontaneous complexity.","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy of the Social Sciences', 'Economic Psychology', 'Epistemology', 'Cognitive Psychology']"

At that time, there was no coordination between cultural heritage protection legislation and emergency response legislation and no collaborative relationship between the organizations involved. As a result, the decision to dismantle damaged buildings was made only based on the scheme planned in the emergency response legislation. Under the Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act, enacted in 2014 after the earthquake, a linkage between the two is created, and collaboration between the organizations involved is required. The fact that there was no collaboration between the cultural heritage organizations and the organization with emergency jurisdiction was reflected in the post-earthquake response and recovery process. The fact cannot be ascertained when information on unlisted cultural properties is unavailable, even if they are damaged and dismantled. Christchurch was not the case since the list of heritage buildings in Christchurch is extensive and comprehensive. In Japan, however, the protection of unlisted buildings remains a big issue.","['Cultural and Media Studies', 'Cultural Heritage', 'Cultural Policy and Politics', 'Social Anthropology', 'Public Policy', 'Social Philosophy', 'Sources and Subjects of International Law, International Organizations']"

Although “big data” can provide valuable and significant contributions to many areas of food safety, it also raises important questions about security, privacy, data control, data governance, transparency, de-identification, and anonymization that must be carefully considered by governments and lawmakers. The development of regulatory policies and regulations related to big data in food safety is still in its infancy. In addition, countries around the world have different laws and regulations regarding data privacy. The privacy of customers and citizens is regulated by data policies, data laws, statutes, and general government legislation. Furthermore, each country may have its own interpretation and set of rules and laws related to digital data, big data, and open data. The main challenges related to privacy are unjustified surveillance actions, incorrect results and/or projections, the use of biased data, and unapproved secondary uses of personal information. Advances in digital technologies occur very rapidly, which can make it very difficult for protection laws and legal systems to follow. The food industry collects a lot of data, likely more than all of government combined. Having access to this data to help inform not only risk assessments but also policy and regulations is extremely valuable. Greater advancements in the collection and use of big data in the food safety area will depend on the organization and execution of high-level standard specifications and the development of increased privacy protection. This will require the cooperation of all countries that see the tremendous benefits of big data sharing to drive continuous improvement in food safety.","['Life Sciences', 'Food Microbiology', 'Big Data', 'Big Data/Analytics', 'Food Science']"

Jordanian firms, like other firms around the world faced a financial crisis due to decrease in consumers’ demand and obstacles with shipping goods around the world. The current study examines the impact of the Jordanian national defense law in providing a financial protection for firms during the pandemic. Also, we study the behavior of consumers and business owners using an online interview. The results show that business owners are more likely to keep using the same prices before the quarantine period and consumers are more likely to have a buying panic, which, in return, have a positive impact on cash flow. In addition, the study proposed an equation that would guide business owners in calculating the shortage of cash flow and liquidity (SCFL) during crisis periods that similar to that of the quarantine period of COVID-19.,The study provides recommendation to that governmental authorities on enactment of more regulations and policies that provide guidance on how to deal future economic crisis which should provide protection for the local economy and assist firms in getting the financial support they need go through future crisis.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-13013-7_9,en,Racism Down the Barrel of the Colonial Gun,OriginalPaper,"This chapter argues that armed policing is institutionally racist, specifically in countries that have undergone colonisation like New Zealand. The argument is that more democratic policing models are characterised by their largely unarmed status, because the consent of citizens to be policed is essential under these circumstances. Policing by consent allows the public the democratic right to access a criminal justice system. However, the introduction of firearms to routine policing can indicate the State’s acceptance that a bullet can be used to circumvent democratic processes, such as a trial, which challenges the rights of the public as citizens. While Britain has typically utilised policing by consent for its citizens, it is notable that an armed militarised approach was taken in its colonial territories. New Zealand started out as a militarised armed police designed to suppress the indigenous population. Once this was mostly achieved, unarmed policing by consent became the policing model of choice. In more contemporary times the unarmed status of the police in New Zealand is being challenged. The Police Association appears determined to overturn the more democratic policing by consent model and revert to something that more closely resembles the armed colonial policing model.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Crime and Society', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Public Health']"

Renaissance utopists typically investigate this topic in detail, yet Agostini’s account stands out amongst those of his contemporaries for its length and broad scope—health is, in fact, the aspect of his utopia to which he devotes most of his attention. Agostini articulates his exposition into four main parts that examine: (1) the natural conditions conducive to health (the site and climate of the city), (2) the urban sanitary measures designed to avoid the rising and spreading of diseases (adequate housing, streets cleanliness, population distribution), (3) the lifestyles promoting health (diet and sleep), and (4) the best ways of restoring health (doctors and physicians). However, in his analysis of the utopia’s health system, Agostini keeps reminding, via Infinite, that though human beings should attend to their physical well-being, their greatest priority should be their spiritual health.","['History', 'European History', 'Cultural History', 'History, general', 'History of Philosophy']"

Three major ideologies which have influenced government policies regarding  poverty in modern welfare history will be analyzed: liberalism Liberalism , exclusionism Exclusionism , and social democracy Social democracy . This chapter uses the historical case of Britain in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to examine what these ideologies said about government social policy as a way of alleviating poverty, and how support for (or antagonism against) the welfare state Welfare state grew therefrom. It was found that in Britain, a new version of liberal ideology Ideology that incorporated some elements of social democracy Social democracy appeared and contributed to the expansion of the welfare state Welfare state in the early twentieth century. From the analysis in this chapter, three conclusions can be drawn for the first goal of the SDGs. First, in order to eliminate relative poverty Relative poverty in developed countries, it is necessary to recognize the variety of interpretation different ideologies have given to poverty as a social problem. Second, to increase the influence of a particular ideology, consideration should be given to the path dependence of originally rooted cultural factors, for example, the strength of liberal ideology Ideology in the case of modern British politics. Third, a comprehensive discourse that spans science, philosophy, and policy is required in order to gain broad support for a particular ideology.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Development Studies', 'Political Science', 'Asian History', 'Education Policy']"

Despite this enduring 1970s aesthetic Aesthetics trope, the sociocultural context in which brothels operate has changed markedly. With the emergence of sex as leisure and a broader neoliberal commitment to corporate normativity over moral censure, sex industry managers have undertaken to explicitly mainstream their businesses. In doing so, they also reinforce cis-heteronormative codes and values that erase racialised, gender expansive and other non-conforming sex worker bodies. Setting out the accounts of brothel operators and sex workers, this chapter engages with the ways that these norms disrupt sex workers’ identities and self-determination, in turn reinforcing stigma and discrimination in inequitable ways. The community of the brothel, essential to sex workers’ safety and group identity, is, therefore, reconceptualised as a site for enforcing norms of productivity and exclusion. The controls exacted over sex workers within the brothel are also explored through the positioning of brothel operators in parental or familial roles, instantiating obligations for conformity on the part of sex workers. Lastly, norms of authenticity are reproduced in the promotion of sex work as a private realm activity, which has implications for sex workers’ position as autonomous professionals.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime and Society', 'Critical Criminology', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Gender Studies', 'Social Policy', 'Politics of the Welfare State']"

Currently, South Korea does not impose life imprisonment in a literal sense. In the penal system of South Korea, imprisonment with or without labour for an indefinite term is the penultimate punishment, after the death penalty. Those sentenced to imprisonment for an indefinite term can be released on parole after serving a period in prison. Still, few of them have been released, even when they had behaved well and repented, meeting the legal release requirements. In this chapter, we highlight the harsh reality of long-term prisoners and the limited knowledge about their situation. The constitutional court has challenged the death penalty’s constitutionality, but it has also held that the treatment of individuals detained for long periods must meet international human rights standards and recognize the human dignity of prisoners. We propose that the principle of human dignity, set by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture in 2016, along with the Nelson Mandela Rules, should influence the decisions of the South Korean Government in contemporary debates surrounding alternatives to the death penalty.

However, the creation of such a marketplace presupposes the existence of optimal demand and supply of agrobiodiversity, linked plant genetic sequence data and local/traditional knowledge on how best to use agrobiodiversity. Farmers’ tendency to prefer genetically uniform “high yielding” seeds and the adoption of chemical intensive farming have compromised the supply of agrobiodiversity. At the same time, regulatory regimes have disincentivized the use of agrobiodiversity in research and breeding programs, resulting in a lack of demand for agrobiodiversity. This chapter argues that these trends result from (inadvertent) inequities in existing regulatory frameworks that primarily support uni-directional data/knowledge flows from the formal sector (academia, industry) to the informal sector (farmers). We propose ways in which rapidly evolving technologies like blockchain/DLTs and AI/Machine Learning can (and should) diversify the direction of scientific research as well as of data/knowledge flows in the agricultural sector. The chapter thus provides food for thought for developing novel regulatory frameworks and ethical business models for robust digital marketplaces for agrobiodiversity for the benefit of farmers, researchers, and the environment.","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy of Science', 'Plant Sciences', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In doing so, the chapter elaborates what is required of judgment when our “general concept of the sensible” proves inadequate for rendering clusters of phenomena “intelligible”. This typically occurs when we fail to find a principle under which we can “subsume” them, that is, when determining reason is insufficient and so has to be replaced by an alternative, two-step procedure, reflective reasoning in combination with teleological projection. The two components of reflective-teleological judgment are argued in terms of reflection constituting the deliberating gathering phase of premises before a tentative, heuristic, that is, merely interpretive and indeterministic judgment can be projected ( entworfen ). Since Kant’s reflective-teleological form of reasoning relinquishes any truth claims, it is declared the revolutionary moment of his proto-hermeneutics in which truth is replaced by the weaker thesis of intelligibility. The remainder of the chapter explores such other features of this new form of judgment, such as its unique entanglement of empirical parts and stipulated whole, the systemic character of wholes, proto-hermeneutic circularity, means and ends relations, purposiveness, and explanation versus interpretation, before addressing the social dimension of understanding ( verstehen ).","['Philosophy', 'Continental Philosophy', 'Hermeneutics']"

Extending the participatory concept of the public sphere to the rank and file that filled its streets. The topography, demography, and economics of the great city and its port are discussed in terms of the contemporary documentation of King, Rocque, and Defoe—in all, London emerges as Leviathan. The reconstruction of the city in the aftermath of the Great Fire is discussed, a process which it is argued, created an unpredictable place of extreme contrasts. A densely populated metropolis, where rich and poor lived, worked, played, and abhorred in close proximity. The chapter develops to consider street life and the thronging crowds readily identified and much maligned by residents and visitors alike and the dangerous nature of the city streets.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime and Society', 'Critical Criminology', 'Social Sciences, general', 'Social History', 'Criminological Theory', 'Crime and the Media']"

It recognizes that policy ideas are embedded in policy paradigms and that these paradigms form the basis for framing, articulating and implementing public policy. It examines such concepts as pluralism, internationalization and globalization, and polycentricism in the study of public policy. Furthermore, it examines the changing focus and locus of policy discussing such issues as the state versus market, the growing complexity and scale of government and the special concerns of Africans relating to the debate around the issues. Based on the above theoretical debates, certain issues and the competing tools for addressing them are identified for closer scrutiny. These contextual issues include the economic issues in public policy; health issues and public policy; security issues and public policy; the environment and natural resources policy issues; governance and policy issues; and exclusion, vulnerability and public policy. The chapter concludes by drawing out the implications of policy paradigms on policy change and policy performance.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'African Politics', 'Public Administration', 'Governance and Government']"

Nowadays, the NIC algorithms are becoming very popular in solving complex optimisation in most academic and industrial fields, including drug design, development, therapeutics, molecular modelling, and peptide design. These algorithms work on a combinatorial approach for small molecules and compound designs that rely on the pharmacological properties of novel drug candidates. Over the last decade, NIIC techniques have been successfully applied in each drug discovery and development pipeline stage to overrule the obstacle of complex and big data from genomics, proteomics, microarray data, and clinical trials.

Drawing on the literature on prostitution policy in Europe, the feminist literature on prostitution and trafficking in women and EU Gender Studies, I argue that the EP’s neo-abolitionist turn can be explained by the coalescence in the mid-1990s of three key factors: Sweden’s accession to the EU and the attendant positioning of Swedish feminist neo-abolitionist norm entrepreneurs in central positions of power within EU institutions; the consolidation of a feminist neo-abolitionist velvet triangle through the creation of strong institutional links between the EC, EP and EWL, which remained unchallenged, and the articulation of a neoliberal model of gender and sexual emancipation within the violence against women policies of the EU that strongly resonated with neo-abolitionist ideals, all the while neo-abolitionism itself became gradually associated to gender equality as a fundamental EU value. In addition, I argue that this proclivity of the EU’s violence against women policies towards neo-abolitionism results from the operation of what I call the neoliberalism–vulnerability–security nexus , to refer to the imbrication of security as a technology of neoliberal governmentality, through the related role of the notion of vulnerability, with the gender and sexual politics of neoliberalism.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Politics and Gender', 'European Politics', 'International Security Studies']"

The main objective of this study is China’s sustainable economic and environmental development strategies. The author mainly uses literature research and quantitative analysis to prove if there is a correlation between economic and environmental development strategies. The author divides the development of environmental strategies in China into four phases. The first two phases are characterized by “pollute first, clean up later” development mode, which shows no sign of the correlation between economic and environmental development strategies. The latter two phases are featured by the balance between sustainable economic and environmental development, which clarifies the correlation between sustainable economic and environmental development strategies. It is shown that sustainable economic and environmental development strategies are correlated with each other. There is a mutually reinforcing relationship between sustainable economic and environmental development strategies.

It is undeniable that most countries targeted to accelerate their revenue through the tourism industry and hotel sector. It is undeniable that halal tourism has become among the top agendas in worldwide tourism due to the growing number of Muslim travellers. This situation resulted in significant foreign earnings. As a Muslim-majority country in the world, Malaysia is striving very hard to be the best in this industry. In this vein, this paper is dedicated to study the real intention behind the acceptance of this market by the industry players and the public authorities who are responsible for the establishment and implementation of the policies and standards of this industry. Two main concerns are the surrender of religious obligation or business profit-making strategy. A qualitative study by way of interviewing public authorities’ officials and hoteliers was employed to have a clear reaction in answering this doubt. A doctrinal analysis was also employed as a main research methodology by referring to reliable authoritative sources such as government policies and standards to strengthen the analysis done. The findings showed that Malaysia enjoys a great Halal tourism potential. Unfortunately, it is still far-reaching agenda, and much more to be exploited. Analysis of the data also seems to suggest a contradictory intention between the public authorities and the industry players. The former inclines towards promoting Islam as a way of life as to uphold the slogan of Malaysia as leader in Halal hub whereas for the latter, their utmost concern is equally divided between religious obligation and business interest. Hence, this paper opens new research avenues by making significant contributions in giving clear ideas to the more practicable framework, policies, and standards given consideration of balancing the industry players’ religious obligation and business interest.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

These two fortresses were destroyed by fire in 2019 and 2012 respectively, but the decision of rebuilding was made immediately after the fires due to their cultural significance. Due to their legal or institutional situation, it was not mandated to reconstruct them true to their original form, materials, and techniques.

Wangduephodrang Dzong built in 1638, is of high cultural heritage value, but heritage protection in Bhutan cannot stay away from the traditional notion that Dzong, temples, and monasteries can be modified better in use and design. Yet in both cases, the plans were, in principle, to reproduce them to their pre-fire state. How were those decisions taken? What controversies have arisen in the decision-making process or later? Where has attention been focused?

The intervertebral disc acts as a shock absorber and ensures the spine’s great capacity to support high loads and different states of stress, thanks to its viscoelastic properties. Some studies have attempted to describe the viscoelastic behaviour of the intervertebral disc using classical rheological models, such as the Kelvin-Voigt, or multi-parameter models. Even if these models partially describe the viscoelastic response of disc, all viscoelastic characteristics are not fully captured. This article aims to present the current studies on the biomechanics of intervertebral disc and to introduce a new approach using the powerful mathematical tool of fractional calculus. With fractional rheological models, it could be possible to formulate a fractional law that can fully describe the viscoelastic behaviour of the intervertebral disc. This new approach could lead to a breakthrough in the study of herniated pathologies by understanding how the intervertebral disc is damaged and identifying strategies to deal with these pathological problems.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The multi-level analysis shows that despite the significant variation in electoral rules and political dynamics in different electoral contests the numerical representation of women has steadily increased since 1999, although to varying degrees across elections and that gatekeepers have accepted parity as a principle through a new “parity grammar” with both of these developments suggesting that the entrenched dominant gender order may very well be in the process of crumbling. The analysis also demonstrates that political parties still remain important roadblocks to achieving real parity and quality representation—playing with the new parity rules instead of by them; thus, meaningful gender transformation in the political realm has yet to be achieved.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Politics and Gender', 'Gender Studies', 'Comparative Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Public Administration']"

Scholars have previously critiqued positivist assumptions about the race neutrality of quantitative methodologies, argued for a greater engagement of critical race perspectives in quantitative inquiry, and proposed critical frameworks to advance these discussions. In the current analysis, the author adds to this existing discourse through an analysis of complex racialized quantitative systems. Specifically, he offers a way to think about quantitative systems as a complex ecology of schemas, ideologies, structures, individuals, and activities, which is labeled the quantitative research complex (QRC). In addition, he presents a QuantCrit theory of racialized quantitative systems that might advance a more thorough critical analysis of quantitative structures (e.g., research communities, survey operations, and large-scale datasets). This analysis is intended to advance a more comprehensive view of how quantitative systems are reproduced and how systemic racism, quantitative structures, and individual actors all interact to ultimately reify systems of racial inequality.","['Education', 'Higher Education', 'Educational Policy and Politics', 'Administration, Organization and Leadership', 'Sociology of Education', 'Curriculum Studies']"

Besides the police officers, the urban authorities had other resources that helped them as well as the commissioners to ensure that good order could be maintained in the city. These were the tribunaux de simple police (police courts) and the regulatory power given to the mayors to promulgate municipal decrees. Together with these security mechanisms, the Napoleonic police, like their counterparts under the Ancien Régime , aimed to improve the functionality and the safety of the city. They took responsibility for problems that existed in cities and only because the cities existed, such as markets, theatres, factories, social venues and so on. Furthermore, these typically urban places called for specific kinds of surveillance, or even for the stationing of particular agents of the police in such places because they attracted the mobile and marginal populations that were increasingly seen as a risk to social cohesion. The same was true of the port cities, whether maritime or river ports, and for suburbs and theatres. The police were indeed the ultimate relay connecting local authorities to the police of the Regime, but the duties that they sought to perform and that had a political dimension were often secondary to their daily duties.","['History', 'History of France', 'History of Modern Europe', 'Imperialism and Colonialism', 'Urban History', 'Crime and Society']"

Drawing on the feminist scholarship on prostitution and trafficking, I argue that security concerns and feminist neo-abolitionist ideals are inextricably linked in the problematisation of trafficking in women for sexual exploitation that such policies offer, and that such link plays a central role in its securitisation, while significantly altering it. The central element that enables this is the construction of trafficked women as victims rather than threats that feminist neo-abolitionists inside the EU develop, by dis-identifying them from the threatening features of traffickers, irregular immigrants and sex workers along the lines of agency and abuse, using the exact same mechanisms at play in their approach to prostitution: the logics of denial, the metonymic displacement of selling sex into selling oneself and the notion of vulnerability. Yet, in relation to trafficking in women, these become culturalised , fostering gendered forms of cultural essentialism and exclusionary forms of intersectionality that intersect with security to render trafficked victims a risk . This explains why the solutions proposed in the anti-trafficking policies of the EU strengthen security while weakening protection. It also explains the complex process of othering they enact, which is premised on the compulsory assimilation of trafficked victims and attendant exclusion of organised criminals, irregular immigrants and sex workers.

Indeed, the ability to practise without reliance on a demonstrable police power epitomises the romance of the ‘policing by consent’ model – where police officers are effective operators who can convince the hardiest person to acquiesce without recourse to the explicit threat of firearms. Yet New Zealand and Norway are two jurisdictions that while appearing to be ‘routinely unarmed’, are, in fact, more armed than officers in other routinely armed jurisdictions. This chapter sets out how the response model for these jurisdictions does indeed rely on armed officers on continuous patrol. It looks at recent comparative research of routinely armed and unarmed officer practice. And, in doing so the chapter sets out to challenge the logic and rhetoric of ‘routinely unarmed’ policing in modern democratic states. This myth sits in stark contrast to the practical realities of frontline policing.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Crime and Society', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Public Health']"

This chapter shows the application of measurement in a social science context where the motivation is transparency and equity rather than the advancement of scientific laws. However, to achieve these, the realization of measurement needs to be no less rigorous than it is in the advancement of scientific laws. Rasch measurement theory provides the basis for such rigor. The context in this chapter is competitive selection into universities in Western Australia based on a summary performance on a series of instruments which assess achievement in a range of discipline areas. Such selection tends to determine life opportunities; therefore to ensure consistency and fairness, performances on different instruments need to be transformed into measurements which are in the same, explicit unit relative to a specified origin. Because the illustrative context is complex, it is considered that the Rasch measurement theory applied in this chapter could be applied to a range of social contexts where assessments on different instruments need to be transformed to measurements in a common unit referenced to a common origin and where the focus is on making decisions at the person level.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Health Informatics', 'Psychometrics', 'Health Administration']"

Thus, the Armenian occupation of 20% of Azerbaijan following the First Karabakh War when the Soviet Union collapsed was illegal. The OSCE’s Minsk Group/Process miserably failed to implement this. Thus, Azerbaijan had the inherent right of self-defense to finally resort to war in 2020 to regain its occupied territories.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics']"

Based on this, AHP analysis was conducted on 54 survey data (31 companies and 23 National Assembly members), excluding 29 out of a total of 83 surveyors who exceeded the consistency index of 0.2. As a result of the analysis, first, the environment (E) area was evaluated as the most important task for all surveyors at 47.6%. In the evaluation items by area, 34.4% for pollution and waste in the environmental (E) area, 28.8% for human rights in the social (S) area, and 37.1% for ethical management in the governance (G) area were evaluated as the most important tasks. Next, looking at the total weight results for each evaluation item, pollution and waste (16.3%) were found to be the most important tasks. Second, the result was that corporate officials gave a relatively 6–7% more weight to related laws and regulatory violations such as environmental laws and regulatory violations than legislative officials. This can be interpreted that corporate officials are paying more attention to legal risks caused by regulatory violations due to excessive punishment for companies and anti-corporate sentiment. In the development and evaluation of ESG evaluation indicators, the promotion that ignores the opinions of companies that can be called the direct parties can lead to a gap between the field and the indicators. In the future, it is necessary to develop and evaluate ESG indicators that can further reflect the voices of the field.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Transition to the market economy of Albania has increased the vulnerability especially for two categories: the youngest, as the new entries into the labour market, and the oldest workers, who found it difficult to be adjusted to the labour market demand, after the failure of state enterprises, changes in working environments, social services, family, etc. The investigation of older workers in the labour market is focused on five dimensions: (1) the labour market structure and employment status of older workers; (2) the employment & VET policies; (3) the work-life balance with ageing; (4) health and (5) retirement. In the beginning of 1990s, the early retirement was the first policy intervention to cope with massive unemployment of older workers. Then, the parametric reforms of PAYG social insurance for increasing the retirement ages and the insurance period have had an impact on extending the working life of older workers of 10 years until 2018. However, the replacement rate was lowering from 74.2% in 1990, to 56% in 1993 when reform started, to further 41% in 2018 which impose pensioners to continue working or delaying the retirement. The increased youth unemployment, atypical and informal employment, has been new challenges for older workers to be adjusted to the labour market demand and only 10% of them can continue working after the retirement age. The development of employment services, VET, health care and social protection have been inadequate to promote social inclusion of older workers. In the framework of the EU integration, Albania has pursued a process of harmonization the legal framework with EU standards. National strategies have been enacted to guarantee human rights, gender equality, and an inclusive society. The social inclusion of older workers into the labour market is a complex issue that depended not only of the Government interventions, but also by the active engagement of other stakeholders. In the Albanian tradition family continues to be a strong supporting institution for older people and children, very likely to the Abbado’s idea in Italy. This chapter is based on an analysis of policy documents, research and statistics from INSTAT, Eurostat, World Bank, etc. The Eurofound’s European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) 2015, and European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) 2016 are used to identify age and gender patterns regarding work-life balance and social inclusion. The analysis suggests that to fully address the complexity of the inclusion of older workers in the labour market, an integrated approach should involve all relevant policy areas such as education, health, employment, and social protection, as well as engagement of all community stakeholders.","['Social Sciences', 'Life course', 'Labor Economics', 'Aging', 'Social Structure, Social Inequality', 'Sociology of Work']"

Chapter two of the Constitution profiles the Bill of Rights with an extensive commitment to ensure that citizens have access to their fundamental rights. Given its apartheid regime noted for its disdain for human rights, the post-apartheid administration factor respect for human rights as the cornerstone of its constitutional democracy. However, adherence to these laws in compliance with the intendments of the drafters of the constitution left much to desire. This chapter discusses the issue of human rights from the perspective of a functional government committed to the principles of public administration. Compliance with these rights requires the institutionalisation of good governance. The chapter noted that the violation of governance principles in the management of the affairs of the South African state impedes the promotion and protection of the rights of citizens. Thus, adherence to the implementation of public policies with prudence in the exercise of power would stimulate a regime of accountability required for the protection of the rights of citizens.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'African Politics', 'Comparative Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Public Policy', 'Electoral Politics', 'Public Administration']"

Following an initial phase of institutional development of the community model, integration, particularly since the Empty Chair Crisis, has drifted towards an increasingly intergovernmental model in greater tension with the foundational supranational spirit. In recent years, Europe has again found itself faced by enormous challenges (economic crisis, Brexit, pandemic, rise of new powers, etc.). On this occasion, the EU has succeeded in adopting an Economic Recovery Plan that includes an ambitious EU debt programme to finance projects of recovery and structural transformation of the EU economy. Moreover, for several years the EU has been engaged in a debate on its future, which began with the Commission’s White Paper in March 2017 and will culminate in 2022 with the conclusions of the Conference on the Future of Europe (CoFoE). However, the interesting concepts included in the debate – strategic autonomy, European sovereignty – run the risk of limiting their scope to functional developments, without sufficient exploration of democratic aspects. Furthermore, the concept of European sovereignty, if restricted to a replication of state sovereignty on a European scale, would find its transformative and democratic potential significantly curtailed.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Public Policy']"

Substantial questions are still open about the algorithmic legality of AI choices. Deep neural networks do not allow full eXplainability of the decision-making process as the programmer himself does not have the ability to be aware of the logical steps taken to achieve the proposed goal. In these cases the question arises of the “AI black box” which collides with the rules of Italian administrative law which, on the contrary, seeks total transparency as a great metaphor for a “glass house” public administration and is oriented towards a shared administration with citizens. The objective of the paper is to explore the torsion points of algorithmic decision making towards the rules of the administrative procedure, bringing the algorithmic procedure back to a transparency in line with the European Commission's choice of an anthropocentric and transparent artificial intelligence by design that aims the improvement of the algorithm's eXplainability techniques (XAI). If refining XAI will be the key to a complete application of AI in the PA, this path, in order not to slow down the spread of AI and thus increase the gap to the detriment of the public sector, will have to be preceded by a logic of experimentation and incremental input: from the widespread automation of routine activities and administrative procedures with no margin of discretion to a gradual experimentation of AI solutions in complex use cases to support public decision-making through parallel analysis and verification processes. This approach can only be guaranteed through a joint work of jurists and computer scientists in the design of transparent algorithms by design, in the dogmatic construction of an Algorithmic Decision Making to respond to the principle of enhanced transparency required to guarantee the legitimacy of A.I. in administrative activity.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Implementation in the Belgian Case",OriginalPaper,"Belgium was the first country in the world to impose strict gender quotas by law for all electoral levels. The initial minimum 25% gender quotas evolved over time into a 50% gender quota, accompanied by a form of placement mandate and by relatively efficient sanctions. Because candidate lists not respecting the quotas are not allowed to compete in elections, the gender quota rules were turned into a practice almost overnight. Nonetheless, it took a while before the number of female representatives increased. Part of the course of this evolution can be ascribed to features of the electoral system, but not all of it. Therefore, this chapter digs deeper into the implementation of the Belgian gender quotas, paying particular attention to how quotas were implemented by political parties acting as central gatekeepers in the recruitment and selection process. Based on a study of party statutes, as well as more than 50 interviews with party officials from all major Belgian parties at two moments in time, it assesses to what extent and how gender quotas became integrated in the recruitment and selection practices and routines of political parties. As the Belgian gender quotas are formulated in such a way that they must be applied, the question is to what extent the implementation of these gender quotas is something considered to be important by political parties, reflected upon, and eventually connected to and put in relation with other initiatives, measures or policies, or just a condition to fulfil.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Politics and Gender', 'Gender Studies', 'Comparative Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Public Administration']"

The research questions we pose in the chapter are: (a) What has been the EP’s practice of objecting to the Commission’s DA in quantitative terms and (b) How is the partisan political logic of the European Parliament’s practice reflected in its exercise of legislative veto over the Commission’s delegated acts? Using an original data set of legislative vetoes of Commission acts by both European legislators from December 2009 to December 2020, this chapter shows that the formal exercise of the legislative veto to overrule the Commission’s regulatory policies is very rare. At the same time, we discuss the ways the EP has been exercising ‘latent control’ over the Commission in its exercise of its delegated powers. We also conclude that while political groups use the possibility to formally engage in the scrutiny process, the inter-institutional practices established as part of the consolidation of the Treaty of Lisbon favour a cross-party, Committee-based action.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Legislative and Executive Politics']"

To outsiders, respecting the land while engaging in capitalist enterprise may appear to be divergent goals yet the people associated with indigenous enterprises nimbly weave between these discourses, using business savvy to move conversations about environment and land from their focus upon the “ecologically noble savage” to focus instead upon what they see as indigenous advantages in business responsibility, in future longevity, and in stability. The companies’ particular relationships with the material—with territory and terroir, plants, and landscapes—act to blunt backlash, repositioning indigenous people as leaders in responsible business practices and redefining the terms of debate over indigenous peoples’ relationships to land. This chapter combines anthropological theory and methods with legal analysis to argue that, given their legal structure and given societal norms, closely held businesses like these indigenous groups are key to the future of sustainable enterprise.","['Business and Management', 'Sustainability Management', 'Economic Geography', 'Diversity Management/Women in Business', 'Law and Economics', 'Business Ethics']"

The CoNiCrAlY coating was prepared by low pressure plasma spraying (LPPS) and was characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). It exhibited a two-phase structure, consisting of a fcc γ-Ni phase and a bcc β-NiAl secondary phase. The as-sprayed CoNiCrAlY coatings were subjected to isothermal oxidation at 1100 °C. An analytical approach was proposed to estimate the β-phase depletion behaviour from the oxide growth kinetics via mass balance conversions. In addition, the growth of mixed oxides (including spinel oxides and alumina) on the rough and flat surfaces in the as-sprayed condition were considered. It was shown that the calculated β-phase depletion agreed well with the experimental measurements.

Foreign aero-engine companies have applied high-energy X-ray technology to engine measurement to analyze the motion of working components. At present, there is no precedent for the application of this field in China, its specific measurement and verification methods were not mastered, and there was no ability to use high-energy X-rays to measure the clearance of the engine. In this paper, the measuring principle of high energy X-ray is analyzed, and the test method of turbofan engine clearance measurement based on high energy X-ray is investigated according to the structural characteristics of a turbofan engine. Besides, the test scheme of the clearance measurement and the calibration method of test data are proposed, and the turbofan engine clearance measurement based on high energy X-ray is achieved for the first time in China. This breaks through the bottleneck of engine rotor and stator axial absolute deformation and the thermal clearance measurement after working, contributing to the improvement of engine clearance design ability in China. Depending on the comprehensive analysis of engine measurement requirements, equipment acquisition ability, data reading boundary, test procedure, absolute coordinates, and engine temperature, an effective test scheme is developed for the first time. The valid data of the deformation and clearance in the axial and radial directions between rotors and stators (labyrinth seals and blade tip) are achieved. Three kinds of comprehensive calibration methods are innovatively established, namely, the clearance measurement of the capacitive sensor, the differential measurement of the wear deformation of labyrinth seals, and the measurement of axial deformation of rotor axial force. Additionally, the correction and verification of high-energy X-ray measurement data are completed by those data. Finally, the motion law of key components in the working and the change law of key clearance after working of a certain engine are obtained. This result can provide a useful reference for the popularization and application of high-energy X-ray technology in the field of engine clearance measurement technology in China.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

Berlin/Boston: De Gruyter Mouton.), in which gestures are included. These kinetic movements transmit two-thirds of what we communicate (Aghayeva in Khazar J Human Soc Sc 53–62, 2011 ), and ignoring them means disregarding the complexity of the human communication system (Jones and LeBaron in J Commun 52:499–521, 2002 ). When communicating, humans create signs, and “these signs are made with very many different means (…). They are the expression of the interest of socially formed individuals who, with these signs, realize (…) their meanings” (Kress in Multimodality: A social semiotic approach to contemporary communication. Routledge, p. 10 [ 2010 ]). And the way people understand what others mean to transmit can deeply vary. These different interpretations may originate from each person’s experience, prejudice, values, and expectations in life. Therefore, the probability of misunderstanding is vast. In the specific context of a forensic interaction, problems of communication misunderstandings can have serious consequences in a suspect’s or in a defendant’s life. Globally, body movements are not thoroughly considered when it comes to understanding what a suspect or a defendant really wants to declare. However, on some occasions, the correct interpretation of a kinetic movement could contribute to a fairer judicial decision. Through a consistent micro-analysis of interactions, it is possible to create meaning from body movements. The micro-analysis developed by the author showed that body movements can transmit information that had not been verbally uttered. That information has shown to be of great importance in the context of judicial process analysis.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'European Politics', 'Economic Growth', 'Business and Management, general', 'Economic Policy', 'Environmental Policy']"

The main barriers hindering the more active development of renewable energy, as well as the potential for the development of renewable energy use, are considered. Special attention is paid to goverment regulation and state support programs for renewable energy producers. In recent years, thanks to government support, there has been an increase in the number of large producers of renewable energy. Unfortunately, insufficient attention has been paid to microgeneration. There is practically no special regulation, and state support for microgeneration is ineffective and does not bring results.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

With formidable democratic institutions and structures, South Africa has an opportunity to explore the various democratic tenets to promote an inclusive society characterized by peace and stability. However, the deepening crisis of governance has exposed the depth of corruption and mismanagement of public resources.

In the context of the global implementation of the sustainable development strategy, countries including China have actively optimized and adjusted the energy structure and focused on the development of low-carbon, clean, green, and sustainable energy. Under the constraint of the “double carbon” goal, power enterprises timely adjust their development strategies and integrate distributed clean energy, such as wind and solar energy, into the grid on a large scale, gradually forming a new power system with new energy as the main body nationwide. On the other hand, electric power enterprises actively responded to the call of the “digital economy” policy proposed in the 14th five-year-plan, establishing the State Grid big data center, so as to accelerate the digital transformation of power grid by improving the intellectual level of power systems at the same time.","['Engineering', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Energy Systems', 'Optimization', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks', 'Renewable and Green Energy']"

In contrast to explainable models, where the involved parameters have a certain meaning that is understandable, black box models rely on principles that have no other function than to produce sophisticated mappings. The lack of explainability is sometimes compensated by applying a so-called post-hoc explainability method. Such a method is supposed to extract some meaning from the separately constructed black box model, but this technique is criticized for several reasons. In this paper we argue that there is an alternative to explainable models and to post-hoc explainability, by representing explanations as variables at either the input side or the output side of a black box model. This results in explainable black box models, where explanations are unrelated to the working principles, but they are still part of that same black box model.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

As such, it is inserted within the European security continuum that links the two as threats the internal security of the EU and subjected to its specific modality of governing (in)security, premised on governing freedom by managing its dangerous excess using both sovereign and biopolitical techniques. That trafficking in women for sexual exploitation is conceived as a form of both transnational organised crime and irregular immigration, however, makes it a form of forced irregular immigration, and thus trafficked women victims . Hence while the issue itself is addressed as a threat to the internal security of the EU, trafficked women are not; they are addressed as victims and, as such, as an exception to the repressive and punitive regimes the EU deploys against organised criminals and irregular immigrants.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Politics and Gender', 'European Politics', 'International Security Studies']"

Generally, in WSNs, efficient cluster-based routing is employed for data transmission. When Cluster Head (CH) fails, data sensed by the sensor nodes cannot be transmitted by the faulty CH. Consequently, the gateway or sink cannot recognize the data in the IoT sufficiently. Hence, processing information in this field was severely affected.

Individual reindeer herding families own almost 60% of all domestic reindeer in the region. The chapter describes two types of nomadic entrepreneurs: economically independent and those relying on state support as well as differences in their behavior patterns, cultural values, and nomadic routes. Two reindeer herding models are presented: the ‘meat model’ of the Yamalsky district and the ‘antler model’ of the Tazovsky and Priuralsky districts in Yamal. Both models determine the differences in terms of size, dynamics and structure of the herd, length of nomadic routes, structure of production income. Unlike the dominant point of view blaming irresponsible reindeer herders for the depletion of pastures, the authors of the article see the problem as an institutional one – the result of public policies that created wrong incentives for reindeer herding entrepreneurs in recent decades. This policy transferred them to the position of hired herders equal to the state workers. The authors propose reforms in Yamal reindeer herding that will ensure a decisive transition to an entrepreneurial model in reindeer husbandry and an algorithm for the reforms in the state support system.","['Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences, general', 'Human Geography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Ecology', 'Biodiversity']"

Cold War dynamics played an important part in this process. The constitution of two international committees devoted to the study of slavery and forced labour multiplied the demands for information, in turn generating new processes of imperial and colonial self-scrutiny. Ponderations about political and social reform or, alternatively, international normative integration became more frequent in exchanges within the administrative chain. Unfavourable comparisons with other imperial powers, which were then enacting more progressive labour and social policies and incorporating ILO standards, singled out the Portuguese empire as the most resistant to legal change and international compliance. The Portuguese government and most of imperial and colonial bureaucracy, though, remained sceptical about both options. The fact that forced labour practices remained widespread, and an important economic factor, in several regions of the empire concurred for the resistance to change.","['History', 'Imperialism and Colonialism', 'Labor History', 'African History', 'History of Modern Europe', 'World History, Global and Transnational History']"

Persons sentenced to life imprisonment in Japan may be paroled once they have served 10 years in prison and evince signs of reformation. However, the chance of parole is extremely slim. Fewer than 10 prisoners are released each year out of 1,800 serving life sentences. In the meantime, life imprisonment—especially life imprisonment without the possibility of parole (LWOP)—has often been discussed in the context of abolishing the death penalty. This chapter examines the existing sanction of life imprisonment and potential alternative sanctions to the death penalty from the standpoint of international and regional human rights standards. It concludes that the establishment of LWOP without reformation of the current life sentences, which offer very little possibility of parole, could bring about another form of despair in place of the death penalty.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Human Rights', 'Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law', 'Social Justice, Equality and Human Rights']"

The present chapter frames the main debates, advances, and challenges. It is situated within both the implementation turn of research on gender equality policies and the broader implementation focus in political research. By way of introduction, the chapter addresses how gender quotas impact the number of women in political representation. It briefly discusses the main focus and findings of the literature on gender quotas to then articulate how the volume will expand upon these themes. The second section provides an overview of how our contributors address the implementation of gender quotas within the different countries covered. Based on the Gender Equality Policy in Practice (GEPP) approach, the chapters in the volume assess how quotas are put into practice, with which instruments, who drives implementation, and how they are negotiated, supported, contested, or resisted. We pay particular attention to how cultural, institutional, and political factors impact implementation. While the individual country chapters unravel the findings in detail, the third section homes in on how such factors intersect to facilitate or block adequate deployment of instruments. We also ask what helps or hinders the creation of inclusive policy environments that empower those in charge of and/or those who mobilize for quota implementation. The conclusion summarizes the main comparative findings on what makes quotas stick and what renders this secret garden of politics more transparent and accessible.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Politics and Gender', 'Gender Studies', 'Comparative Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Public Administration']"

Therefore, we herein propose a simple and efficient parameter selection method for sliding mode control. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we designed several types of trajectory tracking control laws for a rotorcraft. We derived the relation between gain parameters and desired damping ratio/desired natural frequency by utilizing modal analysis to transform trajectory tracking error as a second order system with respect to position and heading angle. Thus, we rationally determined gain parameters based on the expected system response, which corresponded to the classical response expected in a second order system. After implementing our method to the trajectory tracking control law for a Bo-105 rotorcraft in simulations, we determined that tracking performances can be upgraded or degraded based on damping ratio and natural frequency. In our controller design, as the desired damping ratio increased, although no significant differences exist at high damping ratio, undesired oscillatory responses disappeared. Further, the effects of variation in desired natural frequencies are not as significantly evident as those due to variation in damping ratio. However, the effects of desired natural frequency can be observed in the heading angle of the current trajectory tracking control design; as the natural frequency increased, the tracking accuracy increased. Therefore, the proposed method can serve as a guideline for tuning many parameters involved in the design of an advanced control law.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

In particular, with respect to the “newcomers”, claiming the “right to the city”, after claiming the “right to mobility”, very often coincides with the claim and protection of human rights, in order to build “spaces for survival”. On the one hand, the outcomes of these phenomena can be considered as a serious deterioration of problems, like an existential disadvantage of some individuals constantly claiming their rights, a condition that generates fragmented (individual or collective) identities; on the other hand, they contribute to the construction of the identity of places, generating new forms of city and citizenship, both at institutional level and, above all, in everyday practice.","['Economics', 'Urban Economics', 'Real Estate Management', 'Urban Studies/Sociology']"

Photography provides a range of methodological opportunities, including as a tool for building rapport, for data collection and analysis, and as a component of the dissemination of research findings. However, it also poses significant ethical challenges, particularly in relation to active offenders, vulnerable populations, and cultural sensitivities. While the literature exploring the benefits of photographic methods in criminology has expanded significantly in recent years, reflection on ethical issues and other limitations is less well developed. This chapter explores the use of photography as an ethnographic tool in active offender research in the context of our experiences of conducting research into illegal hunting in Uganda. It outlines the ways in which taking photos contributed to data collection and analysis and the generation of substantive research findings. It also reflects on the ethical considerations of photography as a method in this context, including the risk of harm to research participants and the (vulnerable) populations they represent. Our conclusion is that while the use of photography in ethnographic research of active offender populations should be embraced by researchers, caution should be employed in how photos are used – particularly as a component of publication.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Research Methods in Criminology', 'Critical Criminology', 'Criminological Theory']"

This has primarily involved bioleaching of copper and more recently other transition metals such as nickel, but mineral heaps have also been used to biooxidise refractory gold ores as the initial stage for recovering this precious metal. In the first part of this chapter, the design, construction, and operation of bioheaps is considered. The modus operandi of bioheaps, the different configurations of leach pads (static and dynamic) and the central roles of integrated irrigation and aeration systems are described. The second part of the chapter gives a detailed and comprehensive mathematical model of the heap bioleaching process and how this has been refined over time. A case study of simulated heap bioleaching at a copper mine (Quebrada Blanca) in northern Chile, using the HeapSim2D model, where key objectives were to simulate chalcocite leaching and identify the key parameters that control heap temperature, is outlined.","['Chemistry', 'Applied Microbiology', 'Biotechnology', 'Microbiology', 'Waste Management/Waste Technology']"

Western culture has significantly challenged Chinese traditional culture and social norms, which have been dominated by men. Influenced by Western feminism, Chinese feminists fought to emancipate women and greatly improved Chinese women’s social status during the twentieth century. However, in the twenty-first century, witnessing the problems of previous feminist movements, which any human endeavors could not avoid, the globalized patriarchal world does not wait for feminists to find a solution but have a strong backlash against feminism. In China, misaligned with the rapid economic development, Chinese women’s rights have significantly rolled back to serve men’s interests in the twenty-first century. The double portion of the cultural constraints from both traditional Chinese and modern Western cultures provide Chinese women with both greater challenges and greater opportunities. On one hand, a Chinese woman should not make herself a bigger foot-binding cloth in her mind by internalizing the intersectionality of globalized patriarchal cultures; on the other hand, she should not follow the misleading information from the mass media to be manipulated as woman tools to make great leaps to serve patriarchal and capitalist interests. Surviving and succeeding in the double portion of the cultural constraints of a globalized world, Chinese women leaders have developed a double portion of wisdom from both traditional Chinese and modern Western cultures. If Western women leaders are like iron ladies with assertiveness, Chinese women leaders are more like water ladies with gentleness, flexibility, and fortitude. The hard iron could be broken by harder cultural constraints. Dripping water hollows out stone ( di shui chuan shi ) through persistence instead of force. This chapter utilizes a transdisciplinary approach to examine both the cultural constraints and opportunities for Chinese women from both traditional and modern cultures through historical and global lenses. Implications for Chinese women and Chinese policy-makers are provided at the end of the chapter.","['Business and Management', 'Asian Business', 'Human Resource Development', 'Business Strategy/Leadership', ""Women's Studies""]"

The aim of this research is to shed light on the factors affecting the growth of investment in achieving economic development in Jordan. This study is based on a sample of 116 investment companies using the stratified random sampling technique, which is exploratory in nature and depends mainly on primary data and uses quantitative methods to analyze the data. This study aimed to identify the factors driving investment, which play an important role in the development of the Jordanian economy during the era of the Fourth Kingdom. The study revealed the presence of seven main important factors that encourage investment and include, according to their importance, security and political stability, incentives and facilities, guarantees, legal environment and stability of legislation, modern infrastructure, stability of the financial and banking system, openness of the country and easy access to global markets. As for the unimportant factors from the investors’ point of view, which are not important in determining the decision to invest or not in Jordan, according to the study, they included quality of life, labor and workforce efficiency. The study also aimed to determine the most important benefits and obstacles to investing in Jordan from the point of view of investors. Where the results of the statistical analysis showed that the strong desire to increase income is one of the most important benefits desired from investment and contribute to improving the standard of living of individuals as the least benefit. While the most important obstacles to investment were the administrative bureaucracy and the least influential was the monopoly of feasible investment opportunities by a specific group of investors.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

The optimization process is as follows: (i) the nonlinear dynamic models of aircraft were established. (ii) the tilting path of the tilt-rotor aircraft was designed by the optimal method. In order to minimize the attitude change, control energy consumption, and transition time of the aircraft during the transition process, a novel optimization cost function was built as objective for transition time, pitch angle change, and the control surface deflection minimization. The tilting strategy of the transition process was proposed based on the Gaussian pseudo spectral method. (iii) A weighted pseudo-inverse method based on niche genetic algorithm was used to design the manipulation strategy with the goal of the highest control efficiency and the smoothest transition, solving the problem of control redundancy caused by mode conversion and the lack of yaw control capability during the early stage of conversion. The simulation results show that compared to the traditional transition strategy, the novel tilting trajectory designed in this study brings better transition qualities, and the new control allocation law increases the aircraft yaw control capability, which in turn enhances the stability and anti-interference ability of the UAV in the transition mode.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

Adoption of these concepts in the USA has been slower than in a number of other nations, including Sweden, The Netherlands, UK and Australia. Whereas adoption in other nations began as early as the late 1990s, interest in Safe Systems in the USA followed by about a decade. One factor associated with this delay is the success that the USA experienced with public safety and compliance methods, such as high-visibility traffic law enforcement, during the period in which the Safe System movement took hold in other countries. National road safety professional organizations were among the first in the USA to shift toward zero-focused strategies. City and state governments followed and the federal government took steps in this direction after local and state efforts were well underway. By 2020, discussion of Safe Systems was taking place in national professional associations and early steps had been taken toward federal institutional support. Although implementation in the USA is not yet widespread, lessons have been learned in building public and political support for Safe Systems. Managing public expectations regarding short-term safety benefits is likely to be a key to longer-term Safe Systems support. Increased efforts are needed to inform political leaders at the local, state and national levels of the benefits of Safe Systems and Vision Zero as well as additional education for safety practitioners.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

This model consists of two ODEs—for private consumption and for capital intensity, both are related to labour input in efficiency units. A positive (strongly destabilizing) second-order feedback loop connects these variables. M-1 possesses a saddle stationary state. Linearized M-1 has a saddle path that is allegedly stable optimal solution gained through the Pontryagin maximum principle with an initial private consumption as a jump variable. An existence of such a non-resilient saddle path is practically excluded in M-1. This utter instability leads to typical outcomes outside a viable region: the first with complete destruction of fixed production assets, the second with usage of asymptotically 100% of net output for accumulation of fixed production assets. This unsound model should be not included in realistic models for avoiding wrong economic and climate projections as well as heavy policy risks. An alternative model R-1 with robust proportional and derivative control over private consumption with historically given initial conditions enables socially efficient extended reproduction.","['Economics', 'Natural Resource and Energy Economics', 'Public Policy', 'Climate, general', 'Economic Growth', 'Business and Management, general', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-030-79827-7_37,en,Macroscopic Transport Models for Classical Device Simulation,OriginalPaper,"We review macroscopic transport models as used in classical device simulation such as drift-diffusion, hydrodynamic, and energy transport models. Using a systematic approach, these transport models are derived from the semiclassical Boltzmann equation by applying the method of moments. The drift-diffusion model is based on the first two moments of the Boltzmann equation, while hydrodynamic and energy transport models consider three or four moments. Within the framework of the diffusion approximation, the convective terms in the hydrodynamic models can be neglected, resulting in the much simpler diffusive energy transport models. A discussion of the physical assumptions needed for the validity of these models is given. In cases where the energy distribution is insufficiently described by a heated Maxwellian distribution, energy transport models give poor results. Based on the diffusion approximation, a six-moment model generalizing the energy transport model is presented. All model parameters can be extracted from fullband bulk Monte Carlo simulations. The six-moment model is applied for the simulation of devices with channel length in the deca-nanometer regime. Short-channel and hot-carrier effects for which the heated Maxwellian assumption introduces particularly large errors are studied. Comparing all models, it is demonstrated that the six-moment model can improve on the drift-diffusion and energy transport models.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Electronic Circuits and Devices', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation']"

The fire models can be used to determine the emission of a fire, as well as determine the safety related to smoke and heat exposure for the building occupants. A brief history of fire models is shown, together with a description of the concept of design fires. Dispersion models varying in complexity from simple box and Gaussian plume, to complex Eulerian grid and Lagrangian particle models, allow determining the smoke dispersion over large areas (far-field), including the wind effects on the pollutant distribution. In the case of the most advanced models, they include mesoscale meteorological models and sub-models for complex phenomena, e.g. chemical reactions between smoke particles and air, soot agglomeration and sedimentation. CFD method provides unmatched resolution in the near-field, allowing investigation of building wake and downwash effects on the smoke contamination. As CFD method is commonly used in fire modelling, expansion of the area of interest to building surroundings may result in a more in-depth overview of the consequences of building fires. The chapter provides an elaborate introduction to wind and fire coupled modelling, including tips for building and discretizing the numerical domain and the introduction of the wind into the numerical model.

Since the national CEOS.fr project dedicated to the control of cracking for large structures, it is accepted that the statistical scaling effect on the tensile strength of concrete and the realism of the concrete steel slip law are two essential ingredients to achieve a good level of accuracy in the prediction of crack spacing and openings. The implementation of these two aspects in finite element codes faces two problems: on the one hand, the statistical scaling effect depends on the dimension of the tensioned zone, which varies with cracking, and on the other hand, the steel-concrete slip is generally longer than the size of the finite elements. In this context, proposing homogenized reinforced concrete finite elements is problematic. The most common methods consist in using random mechanical property fields to integrate the statistical aspect of the tensile strength, and the slip is explicitly modelled by joint elements, preventing the use of homogenized elements. However, it is possible to avoid both random draws and explicit modelling of concrete-steel interfaces. The proposed method generalizes the notion of phase fields to address both problems simultaneously. A first phase field integrates the scale effect, and another one the steel-concrete slip. The FE code Castem (CEA) has been modified to allow such generalizations. After having given the theoretical bases of the methods used, we will comment two implementations.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Structural Materials', 'Sustainable Development', 'Mathematical Modeling and Industrial Mathematics']"

Already Aristotle was speaking about ethics, and it will be an even more central topic for the future of humanity. Will AGI consider the needs and understandings of the lower-developed humans? How will humans handle “intelligence explosion” and recursive scenarios, where AI or AGI will replicate itself constantly? Humans reshaped the planet earth to gain benefits, will this be done by an AI system as well? This chapter lists an overview of different AI ethics frameworks and lists different viewpoints for the situation that AI systems will have their own moral status. Section 3.1 describes approaches to how to train AI systems in ethics. One major challenge is, if AI systems will get trained with already biased data sets. Overall, it is still unclear how to teach ethics to AI systems. Section 3.2 lists criteria for Product Development of AI systems and describes the importance of testing environments. Next, Sect. 3.3 analyses some ethical and moral challenges. It shows that moral decision-making is not about logic and rationality, instead, it is about psychologically acceptable explanations. Therefore, it requires a deep understanding of humans and their behavior. Other challenges are accountability (who is responsible for a failure?), law adaption, quick reproduction of AI systems, and the not predictable social impact. Section 3.4 dives deeper into existing guidelines. A survey shows the importance of the requirement of transparency and safety for users and consumers.

The mechanistic conception is, in Gramsci’s view, “the religion of the subaltern”. In Marxism, the division between theory and praxis corresponds to the separation between intellectual leaders and the masses, that is, to a phase in which initiative is not in the struggle yet, and determinism and belief in the rationality of history become a force of moral resistance and cohesion. But all this changes when the subaltern become leaders, historical subjects, protagonists of their emancipation process.

However, some of the lessons learned and the policy changes that have been introduced have posed further dilemmas. It is important to consider what is learned, and how and why it is learned, in order to understand policy change. This chapter explores a number of policy and practice changes, a new ‘critical shot’ doctrine which coincided with an increasing proportion of police shooting incidents between 2005 and 2017, and the troubling questions which remain. Although the amalgamation of eight Scottish police forces to form Police Scotland in 2013 raised a number of important issues regarding accountability, firearms deployment and authorisation, the substantive discussion in this chapter and all the case studies reviewed are confined to England and Wales.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Crime and Society', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice, general', 'Public Health']"

Specific gas constant R and universal gas constant R m are introduced. For changes of state, the caloric equations are presented to calculate the difference of internal energy ΔU , enthalpy ΔH and entropy ΔS . All relevant equations are compiled for special changes of state - isochoric, isobaric, isothermal and isentropic change of state – and for the generalised polytropic change of state. Mixtures of ideal gases are discussed. Mixture state variables using information of components and state changes of mixtures are calculated. Another emphasis is placed on dynamics of compressible stationary ideal gas flows. Speed of sound a , Mach number M and the flow function ψ are derived. Equations for calculating frictional compressible isothermal as well as adiabatic pipe flows are given. Subsonic and supersonic nozzle flows and the normal pressure shock are treated.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

We argue that this growing body of work has often not been consistent in applying an understanding of whiteness as an ideology that operates across multiple dimensions in interconnected ways and, at times, overlooks the material consequences of whiteness to People of Color. To redress this, we offer a multilevel framework: the critical dimensions of whiteness model (CDWM). To build this model, we drew on the four I’s of oppression, and we synthesized critical analyses of whiteness in the higher education and student affairs literature along ideological, institutional, interpersonal, and internalized dimensions. We contend these dimensions do not and cannot exist independently, and they must be engaged in relation to one another to be critical and to understand the consequences of whiteness in the lives of People of Color, thus going beyond just white people. The authors then explicitly describe the CDWM , articulate how the model informs scholarship and theorizes whiteness, express the possibilities as well as the responsibilities afforded by studying whiteness as interconnected, and discuss implications of this work.","['Education', 'Higher Education', 'Educational Policy and Politics', 'Administration, Organization and Leadership', 'Sociology of Education', 'Curriculum Studies']"

This will be demonstrated, in particular, through a close reading of the Erlanger lectures Institutiones omnis philisophiae of 1805: in these texts, which undertake the pedagogical task of introducing his students to philosophy and indeed achieving a “transformation” of perspective, Fichte makes a fundamental philosophical breakthrough. This becomes possible precisely because his focus on the pedagogical task draws his attention to the most fundamental subjective or even “existential” conditions of philosophical insight, leading him, in turn, to a theorization of the capacity of understanding, by producing contradictions, to open up a space of negativity; a negativity that is itself the essence of human freedom, and through which truth is yielded rather than either discovered or produced. Whereas Hegel and Schelling regard Kant’s residual dualism as a philosophical scandal, Fichte, through this notion of a radical freedom born from the unresolved negativity of the understanding, will seek not to overcome dualism through a higher perspective but to recognize its absolutely binding character.","['Philosophy', 'German Idealism', 'Continental Philosophy', 'History of Philosophy']"

Successful implementation of BIM is helping the industry move from traditional project delivery systems to integrated ones. This transition, however, requires reliable and concrete contractual mechanisms to provide guidance and structure. Risk allocation, role definition, and legal dimensions have been achieved through a series of contractual functions such as control, coordination, and contingency. While past scientific publications have investigated the impact of contracts on BIM and vice-versa, questions remain as to how these realization mechanisms interact with BIM requirements and legal issues. This study aimed at understanding the influence of contractual language and legal aspects on BIM-enabled projects. To do so, an in-depth literature review was performed in multiple rounds. Problematic issues in contracts were identified, including contractual complexity, emphasis on controlling provisions, contract incompleteness and missing or unclear legal clauses. Then a coding system was created based on the legal factors identified. The results indicate that current standardized contracts in Canada are incomplete and ill-adapted to support effective BIM implementation. The key elements such as intellectual property, ownership of data, responsibilities regarding the production and control of critical project data and asset information are underrated or overlooked. While efforts have been made to counter this (e.g., IBC BIM contract appendix and BIM Execution Plans), these efforts remain fragmented and bespoke for the most part, which introduces variability in the contracting process and therefore impacts the BIM implementation process at the project level.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

This chapter contends that the effect of the Monster’s apparently random violent assaults was to draw parallels to earlier folk devils which suggests that they were by now established as cultural symbols of panic, watchwords for disruption for the people of London. In turn, the attacks were seized upon by moral entrepreneurs, public figures, and the media as an appropriate new focus for condemnation. This chapter re-examines the Monster case and researches it as an example of a media-led campaign to agitate, or at the very least stimulate moral panic amongst the populace of London. It is argued that the Monster case was more than a processual press-led panic, with its roots firmly grounded in morality and public activism.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Crime and Society', 'Critical Criminology', 'Social Sciences, general', 'Social History', 'Criminological Theory', 'Crime and the Media']"

In spite of these challenges, Croatia managed to contain the infection in spring 2020, but reopening to facilitate tourism has led to a spike in cases in early summer and very high infection rates in the autumn–winter. This chapter traces the perceived politicisation of the handling of the crisis and explains how this led to a breakdown of citizens’ trust in government. The perception that the lifting of restrictions was linked to early parliamentary elections—won resoundingly by the ruling party—and aimed at capitalising the good early handling of the crisis led to lower trust in government. This was later deepened by scandals concerning the flouting of rules by political and business elites. From a bottom-up perspective, the persistent cultural phenomenon of rejecting the authority of institutions, as well as the perception of the government as a “puppet” of big capital, underpinned a shift in the understanding of political agency and democratic participation.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Comparative Politics']"

The proposed controller guides the AUV along a predefined geometric path whilst handling the modelling uncertainties and external disturbances. The control system is developed at two stages: kinematic and dynamic level. At a kinematic level, path following errors are formulated using the path frame, and the desired reference velocities are derived to reduce these errors. At the dynamic level, the actual control force and the moment are obtained to track the desired AUV velocities. The dynamic controller incorporates the time delay estimation method to estimate the unmodelled dynamics and external disturbances. Using Lyapunov stability analysis, the proposed control architecture is proven to be stable, and all the control loop signals are shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to exhibit the controller performance in the face of disturbances and model inconsistencies. The proposed controller performance is compared with the traditional feedback linearisation (FL) control design which lacks robustness property.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics']"

The debate is currently focused on the possibility of using algorithmic decisions also in the administration of justice: the use of algorithms which are capable of making choices should help overcome the propensity for eventual human-decision errors, in favour of the theoretically more certain efficiency of algorithmic decisions. The creation of a predictive justice system, however, raises doubts, especially in consideration of certain factors that might alter the algorithmic logic, e.g. the quality of data and the possibility of system error, which could lead to situations of indirect discrimination. With reference to the concerns and risks of the use of AI for justice purposes, in December 2018, the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice adopted the “Ethical Charter on the use of AI in judicial systems and in related areas” that identifies 5 fundamental principles capable of guaranteeing efficient implementation: 1. respect for fundamental rights, 2. non-discrimination, 3. quality and security, 4. transparency—fairness-impartiality in data processing, 5. possibility of control by the user—‘under user control’.

The experimental scheme shows that between 0 and 10°, each interval of 2° is set as a group. With the increase of inclination angle, the cuttings in the cross section of the borehole change. At the bottom of the cross section, a large number of cuttings deposit first occurs, and the volume of cuttings at the top decreases. The dip angle continues to increase, and the debris particles at the bottom slightly decrease, which are evenly distributed on both sides, and the volume of debris at the top gradually increases.

Although his suicide was committed 2 years after his release (without conviction), the fact that his earliest attempts began while incarcerated—as well as the fact that he developed severe depression while in Rikers—elucidated the onset of severe psychosocial issues that many inmates experience while behind bars. From legal scholars to environmental psychologists to architects, experts in a variety of fields have begun to examine the multifaceted aspects of our penal institutions and facilities, uncovering the flaws that permeate this complex system, and recently the conversation has begun to focus more on the design of the correctional facilities themselves. The purpose of this chapter will be to critically explore and problematize the various sociospatial factors that generate psychological and physical trauma within correctional institutions and to propose some of the most viable evaluative methodologies for identifying the flawed spatial and aesthetic qualities of custodial environments. Techniques for the critical psychosociospatial evaluation of these environments will be explored, primarily with consideration of an enhanced post-occupancy evaluation (POE) methodology.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

Understanding the crack growth mechanism is important for toughening elastomers. This article described in summarized form our recent experimental investigations on fast crack growth in elastomers. The crack-tip features, including the crack-tip profiles and the local crack-tip strain fields, are revealed for a quasi-stationary crack and fast-moving cracks ranging from subsonic to super-shear (intersonic) cracks. The velocity and crack-tip features of fast-moving cracks are discussed in relation to the nonlinear elasticity and viscoelasticity of bulk elastomers. The effects of anisotropic stress softening (anisotropic Mullins effect), which is pronounced in filler-reinforced elastomers, on the crack-tip properties are elucidated. We also describe the characterization of quasi-stationary cracks in elastomers subjected to various types of biaxial loading, providing a basis for the fracture mechanics of elastomers under multiaxial deformation.","['Materials Science', 'Materials Science, general', 'Structural Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

It represents a departure from the “classic” ethical schools, reconceptualizing ethical concepts and behaviors via Foucault’s thinking, as developed through areas of power/knowledge, biopower, and discipline. VS is a combination of Foucault’s discussions of parrhesia—truth-telling—and the aesthetics of existence (AOE), or what it looks like to have an ethically beautiful life. Instead of deontological or utilitarian constructs, the aesthetic evaluation of an ethical life requires a devotion to the truth and to the understanding that living an ethical life is an active process of building, never finished, but it is in the effort to show aesthetic fealty to ethical ideals that itself is the highest ethical aesthetic. Though chary of so-called “codification,” there are several directions that the chapter outlines which can help formulate ethical direction.","['Business and Management', 'Marketing', 'Business Ethics', 'Consumer Behavior']"

To this end, it relies on the jurisprudence of the courts in various jurisdictions to help the implementation of article 24 of the United Convention on the Right of persons with disabilities (CRPD) on the right to inclusive education. The chapter examines the circumstances in which inclusive education in mainstream schools is recommended. In addition, cognizant of the challenges and controversy attached to mainstreaming, the chapter also examines the conditions in which inclusion in a special school is vital for the success of the learners with disabilities. In its exploration, the decisions of the courts prior to and after the CRPD serve as the pivot for the discussion. Ultimately, the chapter finds that the courts have been instrumental in mapping out the actualization of inclusive education.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'African Politics']"

O-T-I design—open, transparent, and inclusive—is an early-stage theoretical framework tying perceptions of spatial authorities and the justness of their spaces to perceived “welcomeness,” while the S-L-S framework was introduced to connect correctional space, layout, and sensory landscape to overall psychological wellbeing. The purpose of these undertakings was to provide custodial architects a design guide to organize their work and policymakers a rubric by which to evaluate it. This chapter presents these frameworks alongside each other for the first time and draws broadly from theories of affective architecture to describe the practice of dignified design. Bridging partially between its orientation as a principled design concept and policymakers’ need for evidentiary support, here dignified design practice is juxtaposed against the experiential outcomes of past prison design as told through a set of interviews with former jail and prison detainees. Moreover, its promise is explored in qualitative interviewing with policymakers involved in recent reforms of jail and prison architecture. Finally, the chapter concludes by proposing a multimodal research agenda to develop dignified design practice and its standards in collaboration across academic disciplines and jurisdictional context.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

Publishing the Qualitative Journal Article,OriginalPaper,"Publishing a qualitative journal article often takes a certain tenacity for a variety of reasons, which are addressed in this chapter. First, extant research shows that top-tiered journals are less likely to accept articles that employ qualitative methods, though interview data are accepted at a higher rate compared to other approaches. Second, as qualitative researchers, we may become a bit “sloppy” or complacent in the presentation of our methods and fail to provide sufficient details about the data analysis. Third, case studies, ethnographies, interviews, archival, sensory, social media, the Internet, and photography, for example, are part and parcel of our current lexicon of research. Under these circumstances, progress demands a certain amount of recognition that may mean using and understanding a different lens of exploration and review. Additionally, we argue that the time has arrived to reject the dichotomy between qualitative and quantitative research. New and standard approaches to research mean accepting and integrating unique and mixed methods that provide richer data. Finally, hoping to support qualitative researchers in the publication process, this chapter examines many of the “dos and don’ts” that should be considered when submitting a qualitative article for peer review.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Research Methods in Criminology', 'Critical Criminology', 'Criminological Theory']"

The features of the development, research, and implementation of a system for automated multi-channel monitoring of time-synchronization devices are presented. The necessity of simultaneous measurements of several signals of time-synchronization devices and the use of IP technologies for the transmission of digital measurement data is determined. The description of the developed schemes of the multi-channel monitoring device, which includes: LPC2378 microcontroller, programmable logic chips “ALTERA”, electronic elements of the RS-232 interfaces, Ethernet, is presented. Theoretical and probabilistic studies of the stability of characteristics of multi-channel monitoring device in real operating conditions on the objects of electric power networks are carried out. The influence of changes in the ambient temperature, supply voltage, frequency-dependent parameter, and frequency of the time-synchronization signal on the variable of deviation of pulse duration of the finite signal of single vibrator from the nominal value are considered. Analytical dependencies were obtained to determine the estimation of the actual value and confidence area for the deviation of the variable of pulse duration of the finite signal of single vibrator in the real operating conditions of the device. The actual operating variable of the deviation of pulse duration of the finite signal of single vibrator and the conditions of optimal temperature stability of the device for multi-channel monitoring of time-synchronization signals of power systems are determined. Laboratory samples of functional parts and a prototype of multi-channel monitoring device were made; their adjustment and testing were performed. Experimental studies were conducted using the receivers of the GPS satellite navigation system, which confirmed technical capability of the device to carry out a reliable real-time monitoring of four time-synchronization signals simultaneously. The use of the obtained digital monitoring data allows to improve the quality of time-frequency support and, as a result, to increase the reliability and energy efficiency of SMART Grid power systems.","['Energy', 'Energy Systems', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Control and Systems Theory']"

Yet applied theories of rehabilitation pay insufficient attention to how prison architectural and design factors produce environments that support the process of personal change. In this chapter, we apply an ecological system-oriented approach to present a theoretical framework that explains how the physical, social and psychological elements of a prison environment interact to support or inhibit rehabilitation. The result is an applied multilevel model of prison-based rehabilitation. This model hypothesises that the rehabilitative power of the prison environment emerges when its structural and relational components interact in ways that satisfy basic psychological needs; facilitate prosocial skills and knowledge transfer and support positive identity transformation. It is the emergence of these causal properties within the environment that allows the experience of prison to generate rehabilitative progress and success among those who are imprisoned. This causal model also provides theoretical guidance in the design and delivery of rehabilitative prisons as well as an empirical framework to examine the relationships between the multiple environmental elements and rehabilitation outcomes.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

All ministers in the Dutch government have their own (crisis) authority, the Prime Minister being the primus inter pares without a formal power to overrule any ministerial decision. Numerous governmental advisory bodies have the right to come up with critical reflections. In the creating of safety policies, the legislator is required to take into account a public cost–benefit analysis. During times of regional crisis, the mayors of the greater municipalities are legally given the overall command of said crisis unless a state of emergency is declared. The Covid-19 response in the Netherlands showed another reality in which the Prime Minister and the two ministers responsible for health care de facto took command, advised only by the so-called Outbreak Management Team (OMT) which consists of experts on infectious diseases. No explanation of the OMT advice and the resulting choice of policies were ever published. This centralization of power without a legal basis, as well as the policies that were decided upon, has not been questioned by parliament, mainstream media, the advisory bodies, or decentral authorities. Mild callings for a more integral and proportionate basis for decision-making have been made during the crisis, but have not been answered. The explanation for this unprecedented change in governance patterns is, according to all politicians and top civil servants spoken with during advisory talks, a personal fear for accountability while faced with policy choices that might kill thousands of vulnerable people in short notice.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Comparative Politics']"

The text is in three main sections. First, presenting the intrinsically problematic nature of prison design and relating it to the reference literature. Second, spelling out the implications of addressing prison design critically. Finally, discussing seven case studies, which, to a greater or lesser degree, successfully address critical prison design. In our view, engaging in critical prison design implies addressing three fundamental concerns. First, actively pursuing the visibility of current and visionary penitentiary realities through incorporating prison design into general design discourses. Second, using design to generate significant improvements in the living conditions of inmates, workers, and visitors. Third, problematising confinement and actively working towards decarceration. This last concern lends itself to two avenues of design-based research: innovative and experimental design proposals to challenge dominant views on detention; and a push for the adaptive reuse of existing custodial facilities, suggesting socially desirable uses for the prison’s heterotopic qualities. The chapter’s fundamental aim is to present the possibilities (and limitations) of architectural design as a critical practice, while actively contributing to a progressive debate on custodial spaces, institutions and practices.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

In elucidating Locke’s philosophy of race, I begin by looking at what Locke took to be the significance of and appropriate starting-points for inquiry into race. After showing why studying race is important, and how one should begin the investigation, I illustrate Locke’s refutation of anthropological theories of race. After discussing Locke’s critique of anthological theories, I discuss Locke’s positive racial view. Locke argued that race is a product of history. In fact, race is itself a culture-product—a sort of value that better unifies members of a group around a shared culture-type. After discussing Locke’s ontology of race, I discuss Locke’s answer to the normative question of race—namely, what we ought to do with race. Locke seems to have thought that race is of value beyond pragmatic reasons that would license conserving it. Race is valuable because of its necessity for culture. And culture is necessary for human flourishing. I end with a discussion of Locke’s views of racism, along with his statements on so many “fallacies of race.”","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy, general', 'African American Culture', 'History of the Americas']"

Since the middle of nineteenth century, global surface temperature has risen by more than 1 °C. Since the beginning of the twentieth century, global mean sea level has risen about 200 mm. Extreme weather events have become more frequent and intensive since the middle of twentieth century. Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from human activities have substantially increased the greenhouse effect and global warming. To limit global warming to well below 2 °C and limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, the global community needs to achieve net-zero emissions as soon as possible. Given that China is the world’s largest emitter of GHG, the global fight against climate change would eventually fail without China’s net-zero efforts. The world needs China to succeed. However, major changes are needed for China to secure its net-zero emissions by 2060. This is a real challenge.","['Energy', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Sustainable Development', 'Climate, general', 'Fossil Fuels (incl.

Digitalisation has led to the transformation of how work can be done and where it can be carried out. It leads to the rise in new jobs and working conditions such as flexible working arrangements (FWAs) and gig/platform workers. It is the objective of this paper is to examine the influence of digitalisation upon the working conditions based on the employment legislation currently enforced in Malaysia. This study raises two questions: firstly, to what extent the jobs and working conditions in Malaysia are influenced by digitalisation? Secondly, whether existing Malaysia’s employment legislation can accommodate the changes to the jobs and working conditions resulting from digitalisation? It is submitted that the traditional working conditions (permanent staff, permanent office and fixed working hours) are no longer suitable to cater who are involved in the digital economy. This paper is written utilising analytical methodologies with the secondary descriptive data drawn from previous literature on the influence of digitalisation on job and working conditions. It is concluded that the existing employment legislation does not provide sufficient protection to the new forms of employment created by digitalisation. It is therefore recommended that a suitable policy is urgently needed to enable better protection to those who fall within the non-standard forms of employment.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"
doi:10.1007/12_2022_132,en,Degradation of Tires During Intended Usage,OriginalPaper,"There are several factors that influence the wear behaviour and service life of tires. Three of them are closely interrelated. They are the tire design, the operating conditions and the rubber material from which the tire is made. One of these factors is of utmost importance and less tangible. It is the choice of the appropriate elastomer, fillers, additives and also vulcanising agents to meet the specific requirements for a particular tire. There are expectations for noise, grip, rolling resistance and comfort, stability as well as safety at the limit (braking, cornering). Alongside this, the biggest challenge in tire development is to extend the lifetime of the tire by increasing resistance to tire degradation, which leads to cracking and wear, as much as possible to reduce overall costs and pollution and to increase sustainability to save resources. All these challenges are the focus of scientists and engineers as long as rubber is used for transport and locomotion of cars, trucks, etc. Moreover, it is difficult to establish correlations between available laboratory tests and real tire tests in the field. Therefore, this chapter gives a brief introduction to the theory of fracture mechanics of rubber leading to wear and shows why analyses with long known laboratory equipment predict a different wear behaviour of rubber than that of a tire in service. Finally, a broad overview is given of novel, high-performance technical measuring equipment with which very reliable experimental results could be obtained that correspond very well to the theory of fracture mechanics and much better to the real tire wear behaviour in service. The recent experimental research impressively demonstrates what a huge step has been taken in the meantime to improve the prediction of wear under specific operating conditions and the design and production for tailor-made tires.","['Materials Science', 'Materials Science, general', 'Structural Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

This chapter presents analytical models and useful charts for IC design using the most advanced planar MOSFET technological nodes. After a brief review of the progress in MOSFET architectures, the state-of-the-art UTBB FDSOI technology advantages are compiled, and some important designer needs are reminded. The main physical ingredients involved in the MOSFET strong inversion operation are reviewed and generalized to the UTBB FDSOI transistors with a particular focus on the back-gate voltage impact. For better insight into the weak inversion and moderate inversion regimes, both the low-frequency g m / I D FoM and the high-frequency y m / I D FoM are presented. A modeling of the UTBB FDSOI MOSFET is proposed for low-frequency and high-frequency operations and compared to measurements considering distributed effects in both the gate and the channel. The results show excellent agreement across all regimes of operation including very low bias conditions and up to 110 GHz. Finally, an LNA circuit first-cut sizing procedure using presented charts is proposed for an expected operation at 35 GHz.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Electronic Circuits and Devices', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation']"

Instead of using fixed integer order derivatives as usual, fractional order derivatives are used because of the possibility of adjustment.

The control law is constructed from a candidate of the Lyapunov function in order to assure the stability of sliding surfaces, and an updated law for neural network weight matrices is derived from it. Simulation findings show that the suggested control technique is effective, resulting in a lower swing and more precise location tracking as anticipated.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Electrical Engineering']"

Traditional small video satellite imaging tracking method requires the priori position information of the target and cannot observe non-cooperative ground targets. To remedy the deficiency, this paper designs a video image-based method which performs attitude adjustment based on the projection of the target in the image plane. Firstly, this paper establishes a camera model to reveal the principle of small video satellite perspective imaging; The spacecraft attitude kinematic model expressed in quaternion form and the spacecraft attitude dynamics model under the rigid body assumption are introduced; Then, the satellite attitude error and angular velocity error are calculated based on the deviation of the target real-time pixel coordinates from the desired projected position, and the error quaternion and error angular velocity are used as control feedback. In order to counteract the effects of torque disturbance and rotational inertia uncertainty on the satellite visual tracking control, a fast response overshoot-free sliding mode tracking controller without relying on the accurate model of the satellite is designed. The LaSalle invariance principle are used to demonstrate the asymptotic stability of the control system. Numerical simulation proves that the designed controller can effectively accomplish the visual tracking control of ground targets and has strong robustness against torque disturbances.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Computer Applications', 'Geography, general', 'Earth System Sciences']"

The aim is to elucidate the way in which a decentralised administrative system creates the premises and a favourable context for the development of entities with responsibilities in the ethno-cultural field. The paper argues first that Romania’s decentralisation model allows the development of the practices associated with non-territorial autonomy. Organisations of national minorities are the best-defined element in this regard. Second, it argues that both decentralisation and non-territorial autonomy are effective, all other factors and variables being equal. The factors and variables which influence the decentralisation and non-territorial autonomy are: ethnic activism, the typology of responsibilities assumed by entities with ethno-cultural responsibilities and administrative responses to issues related to the protection of national minorities. We conclude that under the conditions of decentralisation, minority groups benefit from support for the development and maintenance of cultural particularities, while non-territorial autonomy creates a favourable framework for empowering minority groups to self-administer. Decentralisation reinforces and legitimises non-territorial autonomy processes when carried out correctly and responsibly.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Comparative Politics', 'Language Policy and Planning', 'Governance and Government', 'Political Science']"

Between the river Elbe and the Pacific coast, communism replaced the emerging modern cellular prison with the ‘Soviet penal model’. Based on principles of collectivism, prisoner self-government, and re-socialisation through compulsory labour, huge numbers of camps and correctional labour colonies saw prisoners housed in communal barracks in a securitised compound, outside of which was another set of barracks for armed guards who would march prisoners out to work in forests, farms, and construction sites or to the camp’s industrial zone. With the collapse of communism, the majority of European former-communist countries joined the Council of Europe and moved, supposedly, towards the ‘western’ penal model. However, Soviet legacies, especially the built infrastructure of the prison estate, have been difficult to overcome. The resulting emergence of hybrid architectures of detention constrains the reform of management practices and dynamics of prison society. Using case study examples at different ends of the architectural spectrum, we describe the emergence of hybrid forms that are uniquely contrary to a linear conception of penal development towards the model western-type prison.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

It can be regarded as a green technology because the solenoid's magnetic induction is the system's primary source of electricity generation. Unlike a diesel generator, it generates power by burning diesel fuel and emitting CO2 into the atmosphere. Other forms of generators, such as solar and wind turbines, have efficiencies that are affected by weather and season. A hybrid generator system produces electricity by turning magnetic induction force into mechanical energy, which is subsequently converted back into electrical energy by the generator. Simulating a combined magnet solenoid to show how the system reacts when magnetic flux from the solenoid exists is part of developing the hybrid generator prototype. To generate power, this prototype uses translation motion that is subsequently transferred to rotational motion. The prototype's design will serve as a guide for developing the system during the fabrication process. Furthermore, while replacing their energy source with a magnet and solenoid, the existing generators concept is referenced to. The solenoid will serve as an energy source, generating mechanical energy and transferring it to the generator via a crankshaft for conversion into electrical energy. The current prototype of a hybrid generator can be improved to boost its capabilities and efficiency in order to generate more electricity.

They are deteriorating because the population of farmers and forestry Forestry workers is declining and aging. The Natural Parks Act introduced a scheme to ensure that environmental NGOs maintain these areas on behalf of the farmers and forest workers. Modernization of agriculture Agriculture has caused the loss of biodiversity Biodiversity in farmlands. Restoration projects have been implemented to restore biodiversity Biodiversity in rural areas. To reduce farmland Farmland abandonment, the government grants subsidies to help encourage eco-friendly agriculture. The government is encouraging active farmers to scale-up agricultural management to be competitive in the marketplace. Solar sharing Solar sharing is one way to help farmers.

In this case, the UAV formation is a complex interconnected nonlinear system. This paper investigates a genetic algorithm for optimizing the trajectories of UAVs engaged in cooperative target tracking by means of vector field guidance, thus performing collective circumnavigation. Computational modeling shows that the genetic algorithm can effectively address trajectory optimization. Post-optimization reduction in the fitness function value is noted. Another finding is that it is necessary, when tuning the UAV heading controllers, to minimize not only the error of distance to the circular path around the target but also the relative inter-UAV distance error.","['Engineering', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Robotics', 'Computational Intelligence']"

Therefore, it can be referred to as a waqf based Ijarah Smart Sukuk model. In a study conducted by Che Zuina Ismail ( 2015 ), it is found that due to several reasons such as bureaucracy and lack of transparency in waqf administration, Waqf has lost much of its dynamism. Due to these reasons and several others, many waqf properties are either lying idle or in a dilapidated condition, which has led to Awqaf's effectiveness and role being questioned. There is a need to broadly advertise the significant role played by Awqaf as an instrument of social welfare. Hence, this model is suggested for the development of waqf properties and to revive the role of Waqf in society's social well-being. By using the qualitative method, this paper also highlights the issues or challenges involved in the practical application of the smart Sukuk or Ijarah contract, including possible Shari'ah issues. The paper's policy implication suggests that the states adopt this technologically advanced and Shari'ah compliant working model to target the development-related issues of waqf properties.

Specifically, compliance with Ecuadorian legislation was studied through the Web sites of Chinese mining companies. To study the transparency of public information in Chinese mining extractives, a set of indicators adapted to the Ecuadorian legal framework was applied.

Their mechanical properties are altered by thermal aging. The demonstration of the mechanical integrity requires the assessment of the mechanical behavior before and after aging. In this work, we focus on the identification of the relevant microstructure parameters controlling the behavior of the unaged materials, which allows later to track the effect of aging temperature and time on these parameters. We propose an analytical flow equation obtained by integration of the Kocks–Mecking constitutive equations in ferrite and in austenite. The macroscopic behavior is assumed to obey a simple mixture rule of the two phases weighted by their respective volume fractions. The close agreement with many tensile curves, obtained at different temperatures on different duplex steels, suggests that the behavior of the unaged cast Duplex stainless steels is determined only by the volume fraction of ferrite, with no significant effect of the chemical composition.","['Materials Science', 'Metallic Materials', 'Characterization and Evaluation of Materials', 'Structural Materials', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films', 'Nanotechnology']"

They do not rely on a central source to preserve records, instead of disseminating data over a network, unlike traditional types of record-keeping. Blockchains are the technological underpinnings of digital currencies like Bitcoin. Beyond transactions, blockchains, both private and public, have a variety of present and proposed applications. They can be used to verify people and data, as well as serve as a foundation for file systems and content distribution. The Paper explains why public permissionless blockchains exist in a world apart from the real world. Several architectural elements of such blockchains make it partially law-proof, or, to a degree, a technology that creates a realm in which the law cannot be implemented as it is today. For starters, these blockchains use pseudonymity to protect their users’ privacy. When using blockchain platforms and services, users show their “public key,” which is an encrypted identification, rather than their real-life identity. Second, because of their distributed and decentralized character, these blockchains are immutable, posing a substantial obstacle to enforcement. A promising technology has gotten a lot of attention over the last decade: blockchain. It has a lot of promise, according to predictions and testimony. Despite this proliferation of material, there is still a shown need to comprehend and overcome the technology's limits, as well as inadequate empirical research of its stated values. This Paper particularly examines two contemporary blockchain applications for human rights business practice and argues that established legal and regulatory functions and systems of accountability must not be replaced with technology for blockchain's actual value to be realized. We conducted a qualitative analysis using a literature study and primary research to highlight avenues to examine for future uses of the technology in supply chain initiatives, as well as existing evolutions of blockchain's current implementations.","['Engineering', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Materials Science, general', 'Nanotechnology']"

Most children in child welfare systems are not parentless, but rather separated from their parents. Understanding who is labeled as an orphan is important; this labeling tends to dictate the type of services a child may receive. Children lose or become separated from their parents for many, often overlapping reasons. Perhaps the most common reason for parental separation globally is poverty – poverty harms and destabilizes families and communities overall, creating orphans among other ill effects. Other causes of orphanhood may include substance abuse, other diseases, natural disasters, son preference, single motherhood stigmatization, wars and violence, parental migration, and discriminatory disability policies. Children may also be victims of fraud, trafficking, and/or kidnapping. Countries have responded to orphanhood in a variety of ways. Generally responses centered around family preservation are considered most optimal. Other responses include foster care, group homes, and orphanages. When families cannot be reunited, adoptions are sometimes carried out. A broad understanding of the issues of orphanhood may equip educational, medical, social work, and psychological professionals as well as (potential adoptive) parents and volunteers to act in ways that align with orphan’s best interests in particular circumstances.","['Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences, general', 'Social Work', 'Social Structure, Social Inequality', 'Globalization']"

Finally, a recursive process of combining and replacing solutions is given to extract the required explicit control laws.

After the signing of the Bologna declaration in 2005, the modernization of teacher education sped up significantly, specifically in terms of institutional structure, curricula, and assessment and examinations. However, despite the steps taken to reform teacher education in the Republic of Moldova, there are still unresolved problems: the incompatibility of the teacher training system with UNESCO and European standards; the lack of an external accreditation system for pedagogical institutions; the supply and demand discrepancy of teachers in the labour market; and the lack of student mobility.","['Education', 'Teaching and Teacher Education', 'International and Comparative Education', 'Professional & Vocational Education', 'Education, general']"

Journeys of Migrants, Refugees and Asylum Seekers Towards Labour Market Integration",OriginalPaper,"Migrants and asylum seekers have faced important hurdles in integrating in the Italian labour market. The segmented and ethnicised nature of this coupled with their often-uncertain residence status significantly contribute to such difficulties. Building on previous studies that looked at the role of policies and structural factors in migrants’ labour market integration, this chapter adopts a biographical perspective to investigate how pre-migration experiences as well as turning points after arriving in Italy have shaped migrants’ and asylum seekers’ labour market integration trajectories. Using biographical narratives, we look at specific events and actors (people or organisations) that marked turning points and provoked epiphanies – whether negative or positive – for the migrant. Our findings highlight the fragmentation of the Italian labour market and the many hurdles that migrants experience. They also highlight how pre-departure experiences and networks at destination contribute to building migrants’ resilience and help them turn their migration experience into a positive one.","['Social Sciences', 'Migration', 'Labor Economics', 'Sociology of Work']"

We did a stock take of the many reasons why, using the analogy of ‘elephants in the room’ and examined the role of UNHCR, international non-government organisations and donors, faith-based organisations, extremist organisations, sexual abuse by humanitarian actors, the continuing silencing of rape, sexual and gender-based violence, and the resistance to women’s participation in decision-making. We were saved from the depths of despair by two new projects, in New Delhi and Nairobi, where we sponsored and evaluated refugee-led community development projects. In parallel research in Australia we examined the meaning of rights for refugee communities. These three projects consolidated our understanding of the potential of rights-based participatory community development, and an understanding of ‘ontological security’. We were frustrated because having learned so much, there was no major meeting on the horizon where we could share it.

While the debates about colonialism, and decolonization, were growing in scope and intensity, the Portuguese government insistently refused to provide any information about the colonies to the UN. Despite diplomatic resistance, the salience of the Portuguese colonial question in international debates and institutional workings increased. Efforts to block the discussions about the political and constitutional nature of the colonial territories demanded new arguments and evidence of Portuguese ability to govern such distinct territories and populations in a “progressive” fashion. That was hardly compatible with the intensification of accusations of colonial forced labour. As a result, as this chapter shows, in 1956, the Portuguese government ratified the 1930 convention on forced labour. In doing so, Portugal became the last European colonial empire to ratify the 1930 convention, 26 years after its promulgation.","['History', 'Imperialism and Colonialism', 'Labor History', 'African History', 'History of Modern Europe', 'World History, Global and Transnational History']"

Adapting to projected changes could help lower the risk of both climate change and catastrophes. Both climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR) strive to control hydrometeorological risks by reducing community susceptibility, increasing their resilience, as well as minimizing the consequences of climate-related disasters and associated risks following proactive and long-term approaches to disaster management. The promotion of a DRR management system has the potential to significantly enhance adaption to the changing climate and vice versa. As a developing country, it is extremely important for Bangladesh to consider how to tackle climate change and disasters in the long term for human welfare and sustainable development. Bangladesh has separate climate change and disaster management systems, with minimal synergistic approach between the two. Over the time, the country has moved swiftly with its legislative responses to climate change and disaster, but when it comes to DRR and CCA integration, things are still in the early stages with a slew of obstacles to overcome.

The guidance algorithm employed in this study is a look ahead-based steering guidance law which provides the required guidance command to the controller for executing the target mission. The command signal generated by guidance law is based on the airship current location relative to the next target waypoint. Two different control architectures are used in the GNC algorithm in order to execute the guidance command and carry out the path following mission. A proportional–integral–derivative (PID) law-based outer loop kinematic controller is designed to control airship attitude/orientation, and a linear quadratic regulator (LQR)-based inner loop optimal controller is designed to control the airship’s speed and angular rates. Performance and robustness of developed GNC scheme are evaluated in MATLAB®-based simulation environment for two different flight scenarios. Results show that an optimal path following trajectory is obtained with minimum deviation from the given target waypoints.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engineering Design', 'Building Materials']"

Accounts of results produced from reinvigorated attention to the measurement, management, and improvement of the outcomes of health care show that much has been learned, and much remains to be done. This article proposes that causes of the failure to replicate in health care the benefits of “lean” methods lie in persistent inattention to measurement fundamentals. These fundamentals must extend beyond mathematical and technical issues to the social, economic, and political processes involved in constituting trustworthy performance measurement systems. Successful “lean” implementations will follow only when duly diligent investments in these fundamentals are undertaken. Absent those investments, average people will not be able to leverage brilliant processes to produce exceptional outcomes, and we will remain stuck with broken processes in which even brilliant people can produce only flawed results. The methodological shift in policy and practice prescribed by the authors of the chapters in this book moves away from prioritizing the objectivity of data in centrally planned and executed statistical modeling, and toward scientific models that prioritize the objectivity of substantive and invariant unit quantities. The chapters in this book describe scientific modeling’s bottom-up, emergent and evolving standards for mass customized comparability. Though the technical aspects of the scientific modeling perspective are well established in health care outcomes measurement, operationalization of the social, economic, and political aspects required for creating new degrees of trust in health care institutions remains at a nascent stage of development.

Three Dimensions of Morality and Social Movements,OriginalPaper,"In this chapter, focusing on the position of the concept of morality, we briefly review the evolution of the field of social movements from the first formulations of the phenomena of protest, mass, and collective action in classical sociology, through the formation of social movement studies as proper field of research in the 1970s, to its contemporary state. We argue that while morality was central to the classical tradition’s understanding of movements, it lost prominence when the field was established, and still today, morality does not receive much attention. There are, of course, notable exceptions like the work of Jeffrey Alexander, Hans Joas, and the new social movement tradition in Europe. Relatively recently, morality has received increasing attention from scholars studying movements from the perspective of culture. We discuss the role of morality in three of the most prominent theories in this tradition, namely, collective identity, frame alignment, and emotion theory. We argue that they all present promising avenues for developing our understanding of morality and movements while we also point to limitations and inadequacies in each theory or the way they have been applied. We then turn to the constructive work of reorganizing the concept of morality’s relationship with civic action and social movement by developing three dimensions of morality that we argue which are of particular relevance to social movements: selves in interaction , rationalization and justification , and culture and tradition . We trace each dimension from its origin in moral philosophy through its formulation in classical sociology and finally into contemporary theories of civic action. Before closing, we reflect on how the different dimensions intersect and can be applied to the analysis of contemporary empirical cases of social movements and political protest.","['Social Sciences', 'Political Sociology', 'Moral Philosophy', 'Ethics', 'Political Theory']"

It is no longer evenly distributed along the roadway. Where the dust concentrated is the important position to fix dust removal equipment. The dust particle size and diffusion laws at the concentrate position are analyzed, with the increase of diffusion distance, the mass proportion of the particle size less than 10 μm increases. This means that the dust within the particle size range is not easy to settle, and appropriate measures should be taken to reduce its concentration.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Environment, general', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Water, general']"

After all, instead of being a mere “recipient,” the regime was a fully-fledged stakeholder to this partnership. However, after the culmination of a sequence of deleterious events (notably pertaining to the sense of sovereign injustice felt by the regime against the terms of the DCT’s 2006 Concession Agreement), Djibouti’s relationship with DPW turned sour.

The repair of damaged structures results in relatively high direct and indirect costs. Therefore, to predict their durability it is important to have a numerical tool, which is able to account for the above mentioned processes and their consequences for the structural safety. In the paper a recently developed coupled Chemo-Hygro-Thermo-Mechanical model for concrete is briefly discussed. The model is implemented into a 3D finite element code and it is aimed to model processes related to corrosion of steel reinforcement, freezing-thawing and creep and shrinkage of concrete. The macro-cell corrosion of steel reinforcement accounts for all relevant processes before and after depassivation of reinforcement and it is coupled with the mechanical model for concrete, which is based on the microplane model. Loading due to freezing-thawing of concrete is formulated in the framework of poromechanics. Drying creep of concrete is simulated based on the hygro-mechanical model at the meso scale. Investigated is the influence of the interaction between non-elastic deformations of cement paste (basic creep and shrinkage), load induced damage and heterogeneity of concrete. The application of the model is illustrated on several numerical examples.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Structural Materials', 'Sustainable Development', 'Mathematical Modeling and Industrial Mathematics']"

At present, for high-precision determination of the coordinates of the motion parameters of unmanned aerial vehicles, with a known motion model, algorithms based on the Kalman-Bucy filter or the least squares method are used, since the potential estimation accuracy of these methods is almost the same. However, in order to estimate the motion parameters of constantly maneuvering aircraft, it is necessary to use the method of estimating from a selection of measurements in a “sliding window”. Comparative evaluation using algebraic polynomials, Chebyshev polynomials and fractional polynomials by the method of least squares “in a sliding window” showed that the use of fractional polynomials allows us to evaluate not only changes in coordinates and velocities, but also using fractional derivatives, other parameters that occupy an intermediate position between coordinates, the first and second derivatives with respect to coordinates. The latter makes it possible to improve the accuracy of estimates of the coordinates of the motion parameters of maneuvering unmanned aerial vehicles. Moreover, the most acceptable polynomial for estimation is a polynomial with fractional degrees equal to 2.5. The use of fractional Taylor series in the problem of estimating the motion parameters of constantly maneuvering quadrocopters makes it possible not to use recurrent estimation algorithms with adaptation elements, but to achieve the same goal by changing the degree of the polynomial.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

To achieve the coverage control objective, a proper cost function is employed to evaluate the coverage performance of the agent system, and a new type of learning based distributed adaptive coverage control law is proposed to drive the movement of the agents. Local estimation of the unknown environmental model is performed by using the distributed recursive least-squares (D-RLS) method. Accordingly, a novel distributed coverage control strategy is derived to drive the agents to a near-optimal coverage configuration. Each agent only needs to get the local measurement and transmit information with neighboring agents. The convergence of the proposed coverage control law is proven under the condition that the local parameter estimation error converges to zero. Finally, numerical simulation is performed which illustrates that the proposed method is effective and has better performance than previous methods.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Multiagent Systems', 'Systems Theory, Control']"

A Mathematical Analysis,"['OriginalPaper', 'Original Research']","The theory of the diffusion limited electrochemical nucleation and growth of a deposit consisting of isolated 3D hemispherical nuclei has been re-analysed. The analysis focuses on a widely discussed model which assumes formation of “diffusion zones” around the growing nuclei. It has been proposed in the literature that the deposit-free fraction of the surface area of the substrate can be directly calculated from the substrate coverage with the “diffusion zones”. The aim of this work is to analyse whether such an approach can be applied for the growth of isolated 3D hemispherical nuclei. This is accomplished by evaluation of equations which describe nuclei radii at various stages of the deposition process. The formulae allow determining the substrate surface coverage with the growing deposit. This, in turn, allows simulating and analysing faradaic currents due to other than the electrodeposition reactions which take place at the deposit-free fraction of the substrate surface. Both instantaneous and progressive modes of the nucleation are discussed and the influence of the nucleation type on the faradaic currents is outlined. A comparison with other approaches reported in the literature indicates that the deposit-free fraction of the substrate surface may not always be determined by means of recalculation of the substrate coverage with the “diffusion zones”.

The physical environment in which jail residents live drastically impacts their daily routines, accessibility to services, and feelings of safety and security. Considering most jails in the United States are binarily sex-segregated and house significantly more men than women, the gendered nature of these facilities is particularly apparent in the purposive design of these facilities. For women, the design of a facility may act as a barrier to getting their needs met because facilities are not constructed to specifically meet their needs which differ in number and types from the needs of men. Using a case study of one jail, this chapter will dissect how the carceral space, layout, and design of the facility makes it challenging to ensure the needs of women are met through connections to educational programming and health services. In this way, architectural decisions are direct reflections of the purposes and goals of a correctional facility (Wener, The environmental psychology of prisons and jails: Creating humane spaces in secure settings , 2012), which in this chapter is argued to be both non-rehabilitative in nature and gendered at its core.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

Lessons from a Multi-sectoral Perspective,OriginalPaper,"Vision Zero is a term mainly connected with road traffic safety and has its roots in the Swedish road safety strategy. It was formally adopted by the Swedish parliament in 1997, and due to the initial success of lowering the number of deaths in traffic crashes significantly, it has become a role model for road safety strategies in countries and cities all over the world. In Sweden, Vision Zero for road safety has also inspired the introduction of Vision Zero policies in other sectors, and this chapter focuses on Vision Zero from a multi-sectoral perspective. The purpose of this chapter is twofold: to present five different cases of Vision Zero policies and to discuss what constitutes a Vision Zero policy based on these five cases. The five cases are found in road traffic safety, fire safety, patient safety, suicide, and workplace safety. Every case has its unique preconditions in terms of laws, actors, scope, etc., but they are also similar in relation to injury prevention and the ambition to decrease the number of deaths and serious injuries. The five Vision Zero policies are summarized by presenting the problem and problem framing, the goal, measures, and solutions as well as leading actors and governing structures. We find that the problem itself is quite self-explanatory in each case but that the problem framing and attribution of responsibility differ. All cases have on paper been inspired by the road safety strategies, but the systems approach, so intimately connected with Vision Zero, is more or less absent in the cases of fire safety and suicide. Furthermore, in the field of fire safety, responsibility is placed on the individual and on the business sector rather than based on a shared responsibility and ultimately on the system designers. In all five cases, there are a set of measures in place, but there are differences in implementation due to temporal factors and also what kind of governing and steering structures are in place. There is also a difference in internal support where the Vision Zero for suicide stands out as having less support among agencies working with the issue. Finally, the monitoring systems differ from case to case. The Vision Zero for road traffic safety stands out as having a monitoring and evaluating system based on specific safety targets ultimately aiming toward zero (management by objectives). Based on the empirical findings, we argue that besides having a clear problem and problem framing, a toolbox of measures, a monitoring system, and a governing structure, a policy based on a visionary approach with an ambition to reach zero needs additional perspectives or criteria in order to be successful: (1) a scientific approach to problem framing and solutions, (2) a comprehensive approach, (3) a long-term commitment, and (4) a system and structure based on governance . These criteria do not necessarily have to be in place in order to adopt Vision Zero, but they are a prerequisite for building a system based on Vision Zero.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

Efforts to deal with the visible racial discrimination elements that permeated colonial realities were undertaken in permanent articulation with international institutions, their languages, and programmes. The ILO, seen as a viable diplomatic alternative to the United Nations, was a particularly important agent in this process. Portuguese rulers and diplomats believed they could argue for retaining the empire based on socio-economic achievements while avoiding any discussion about the political status of the colonies and their populations. However, these diplomatic and political options came with costs. Within a few years, the Portuguese government was adhering to an unprecedented number of international conventions that had direct implications for colonial labour practices and policies.","['History', 'Imperialism and Colonialism', 'Labor History', 'African History', 'History of Modern Europe', 'World History, Global and Transnational History']"

In particular, we study heat conduction in a two-terminal three-body system. This bistable system exhibits a macro-scale thermal memory effect with tailored nonlinear thermal conductivities. Finite-element simulations confirm the theoretical analysis. Also, we suggest experiments with metamaterials based on shape memory alloys.

Prison design is a social phenomenon, and as such, its actualisation is the result of the interaction of competing interests of different entities. Planners’ success in achieving the expected results of prison modernisationmodernization programsprogrammes seem to be sensitive to the organisational purposes, missions, and structures of prison services, making it harder to identify which phenomenon (or phenomena) influence the results. The same architectural characteristics of prisons, therefore, can have different outcomes depending on the geo-historical context of the prison system in different countries.

After reviewing the theoretical approach, the chapter explores the architectonical and historical features of the Chilean case, showing the priorities and concerns of both designers and prison authorities. Additionally, by drawing on Critical Realism and Organised Hypocrisy Theory, it will offer a plausible explanation of the causal mechanisms behind organisational patterns, how they work, and what can be done to unlock evolution.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

What, though, does the actual practice tell us about the possibilities for ‘deterritorialisation’ of minority identities as well as the ability of NTA to ensure their protection and longer-term reproduction? This paper addresses these questions by critically analysing two forms of contemporary NTA that are frequently portrayed as good practice examples—the Hungarian National Minority Council (HNMC) in Vojvodina, northern Serbia, and the Sámi parliaments established in the Nordic countries. Although the contexts in which these two NTA arrangements were established are very different, I argue that they highlight common issues and challenges that call into question some of the core assumptions surrounding NTA.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Comparative Politics', 'Language Policy and Planning', 'Governance and Government', 'Political Science']"

Recorded M ( T ) data at H  = 100 Oe show an increase of the Curie temperature ( T C ) from 143 K for x  = 0.4 to 153 K for x  = 0.5, but a higher x value ( x  = 0.6) reduces T C to ~ 92 K. A singularity region sandwiched between the Griffiths and pure paramagnetic phases has been observed in x  = 0.4, but it becomes invisible at x  = 0.5 and 0.6. These properties are assigned to a competition between ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic interactions induced by Co 3+ and Co 4+ ions. The Co 3+ /Co 4+ mixed valence has been confirmed upon the analysis of Co K -edge x-ray absorption spectra. Using Maxwell’s relations and M ( H ) data, we have calculated the absolute magnetic entropy change (|∆ S m |). Around T C , the maximum magnetic entropy changes (|∆ S max |) of x  = 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 are about 1.19, 1.22 and 0.81 J/kg K for H  = 50 kOe, respectively. The values of the relative cooling power are in the range of 58 ~ 93 J/kg. Our analyses also indicate all |∆ S m ( T , H )| data obeying the universal master curve as constructing the |∆ S m |/|∆ S max | vs. θ plots, where θ is defined as the reduced temperature. When considering exponential parameters N ( T , H ) and n associated with |∆ S m ( T , H )| and | ∆S max ( H )|, respectively, we have found their values are different from the mean-field theory value n  = 2/3.

UAM aircrafts with a similar flight heading fly in a same layer and the vertical separation of high risk UAM aircrafts can be maintained. The flight profile of UAM aircraft is designed based on the layered airspace, including the flight attitude and heading in the flight phases. Finally, to verify the concept proposed in this paper, several mathematic simulations are conducted based on the urban airspace environment described above. The simulations include complete flight processes of multi-UAM in layered airspace. The simulation data is collected and results are analyzed. It is concluded that with proper management of airspace and flight control algorithm, this work is able to simulate the UAM operation in urban environment. The proposed airspace management method could be effective to guarantee the flight safety of UAM. At last of this paper, the research conclusion and expected future work are discussed.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

Then the excavation of coal pillar roadway with different width is simulated, and the stable coal pillar range of roadway is obtained. Further simulating the mining of the working face, it is obtained that the stress change in the elastic core area in the coal pillar with different widths basically reaches a stable state at 28 M. Combined with the internal stress change of coal pillar in the mining process, the reasonable reserved width of water immersed wide coal pillar is determined to be 28 M. Through the analysis of microseismic evolution characteristics in the mining process of 1314 working face, the stability of water-soaked wide coal pillar in the mining process is verified. This paper provides a reference for the rational design of roadway pillar under the condition of water immersion and softening.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Arts', 'Building Construction and Design']"

The aim of this chapter is to present the most important known risk factors for residential fire fatalities. This review of the literature concentrates on various characteristics of the individuals and households experiencing fatal residential fires Residential fires . We have chosen not to include various types of fire Fires safety measures in this review, such as smoke alarms Smoke alarms , fire Fires extinguishers, or mobile sprinklers, as these are the subject of another chapter. The literature studied provides a reasonably consistent picture of several basic risk factors for death in a residential fire Residential fires . With respect to age, the oldest have the highest risk. Among children, it is the youngest who have the highest risk. In all age groups, men are at greater risk than women. Smoking Smoking and alcohol Alcohol have a large effect on risk. Certain socio-demographic factors are clearly associated with higher risk, such as living alone, having a low income Income , or being unemployed. In addition, individuals with functional limitations Functional limitations are at greater risk than others. These risk factors have been observed to hold true over an extended period of time in several countries, despite a gradual decrease in the mortality Mortality rate from residential fires Residential fires in the last decades. We note that much of the research on risk factors is relatively old, and many studies are of a descriptive nature. It is clear that many of the risk factors identified in the research are correlated. It is desirable that future studies take more account of covariation between the various risk factors and control for confounding factors. In addition, large-scale population-based case-control or cohort studies have the potential to provide a deeper understanding of risk factors for residential fire Residential fires fatalities.","['Engineering', 'Fire Science, Hazard Control, Building Safety', 'Psychology, general', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Public Policy', 'Building Construction and Design']"

The paper has three sections. The first section illustrates the metaphysical significance of Kant’s introduction of the quantitative opposition between reality and negation, which informs the phenomena-noumena distinction and the attribution of intensive magnitude. The second section argues that Maimon’s speculative appropriation of differentials took up Kant’s conception of real opposition between reality and negation but fundamentally revised the theory of space and time to dissolve the problem of applicability in Kant, leading to the consequence of obliterating the pure categories. The third section shows how Fichte inherited the Kantian-Maimonian quantitative opposition of reality and negation in his characterization of the interdetermination between the I and the Not-I and how he developed an immanent account of the relational categories such as causality and substantiality on that basis.","['Philosophy', 'German Idealism', 'Continental Philosophy', 'History of Philosophy']"

The narrow annular channel formed by two rigid coaxial cylinders. The case was considered when there was the end wall at the right end of the annular channel, and the pressure pulsation law was set at the opposite one. The right end face of the inner cylinder and the end wall form the end gap of the channel. The end wall possesses a flexible connection with the annular channel edge and can oscillate due to fluid pressure pulsation. The viscous fluid motion was studied as a creeping one. The mathematical model consisted of the dynamics equations for viscous fluid and the motion equation for the end wall as the spring-mass system. Initially, the problem for the annular gap of the channel was investigated and the pressure change law at the cross-section during the transition from the annular gap to the end one was determined. After that, the problem for the end gap of the channel was considered and the oscillations law of the end wall for the case of the steady-state vibration was determined. The hydroelasticity problem solution made it possible to determine the hydroelastic response of the end wall. The study results showed that the damping properties of the oscillatory system under consideration were determined by the fluid physical properties, as well as the sizes of the annular and end gaps.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Mechatronics']"

The 2019 European Elections Against the Backdrop of a Socio-Economically Biased Voter Turnout,OriginalPaper,"How socially distorted is the higher turnout in the European elections 2019? European elections have been perceived as second-order elections and elite elections since 1979 and in almost all member states the turnout is significantly lower than in the respective national main elections. At the same time, Herbert Tingsten’s political science “law” describes a lower voter turnout as a more distorted turnout. Against this background, it can be assumed that the 2019 European elections will have a lesser social imbalance in voter turnout than is the case with the main elections. Although we know a lot about why citizens vote or do not vote in elections, it is the social imbalance in EU voter turnout in national and especially European elections that has received little scientific attention so far. The aim of this chapter is to present the social imbalance in European elections and to compare the effects with national main elections. The quantitative analysis is based on data from representative election statistics and includes voter turnout and various socio-economic indicators. This avoids uncertainties that would arise from survey data. By focusing on the small-scale level of urban neighbourhoods, the unit of analysis becomes more homogeneous than the usually analysed regions or complete Member States. Eventually, we notice a pan-European problem: despite higher voter turnout in national and European parliamentary elections in 2019 certain social groups are significantly underrepresented. Throughout the EU, participation is much less likely for socio-economically weaker citizens. This social imbalance in voter participation threatens the ideal of political equality and is thus directly linked to the democratic deficit of the European Union.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Legislative and Executive Politics']"

Academic literature on effective treatment approaches for justice-involved young people supports a focus on therapeutic, tailored approaches that build and strengthen positive youth development, social support networks, and commitment to school or work. By establishing the design implications which follow from this evidence, a series of key characteristics emerge that define a best-practice, theoretical facility model: small-scale, locally sited, and integrated with the surrounding community, designed to promote relational and differentiated security, and comprising therapeutic design characteristics. We explored each of the characteristics in three well-regarded European jurisdictions: Spain, Norway, and the Netherlands. Our observations substantiate the theoretical facility model as a valuable tool for drawing into view the tensions, opportunities, strengths, and weaknesses of a design, relative to the facility’s given context. Our findings highlight the importance of carefully considering the design of youth justice facilities in terms of the desired outcomes as they greatly impact upon procedures and ways of working within these facilities, and ultimately impact the outcomes for young people and the community.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

However, the access to modern technologies is not available to all nations on an equitable basis; hence, the categorization between the developed, developing and least developed countries. Technology Transfer has been a controversial issue under the Intellectual Property regime for years now, as without technological innovation and advancement in that sphere, no country can survive with dignity in the modern period. In fact, due to such disparities, the developed countries tend to become more developed, and the least developed tend to go further down the surface, towards regression. But is the “transfer” a matter of concern only amongst countries? Is there no such disparity “within” the nations themselves? Are all the resources equitably divided within the geographical divisions of each nation? These questions often come up, especially when we think of a country as vast and diverse as India. With this paper, the authors seek to highlight the loopholes in the Indian law with regard to technology transfer generally as well as specifically in one of the most important sectors of its economy, i.e., the agricultural sector. It is an attempt to open the minds of the readers to view technology transfer as not merely a global issue, but also a national one.","['Engineering', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Agriculture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

Theoretically, it argues for introducing the thus far estranged perspectives of elite studies and framing approaches to each other. The concept of moral elite is consequently introduced and defined as an elite that is rich in the resources on which moral authority is built, here limited to educational resources, organizational resources, and publications. The chapter applies a mixed methods design. First, social network analysis (SNA) is applied to a unique dataset comprising biographical information on 28 temperance leaders found in the Danish Who’s Who. The analysis reveals three distinct clusters within the temperance elite. Analyzing texts by the most prolific authors shows that each of the three clusters has a distinct profile: an elite dominated by medical doctors and theologians who articulate a traditional value frame according to which medical doctors and pastors carry a responsibility for the community – a responsibility that is expanded through philanthropy and specialized institutions; a revivalist elite of theologians and laymen who pursue a revivalist Holiness and civil society frame emphasizing faith’s healing abilities and the importance of organizing beyond the national church; and an organic elite that represented small farmers and workers and pushed an Enlightenment frame of direct democracy, rule of law, and education. The second part of the analysis shows how each elite cluster integrated the “alcoholism as a disease” belief frame in their value frames: traditional elites as a cause for institutionalization, revivalist elites as a reason to bolster the resilience in the population through faith, and the organic elite as a reason to promote self-care and education. In the final sections of the chapter, I tease out how the moral elite perspective may have implications for social movement research, especially in terms of holding movement elites accountable.","['Social Sciences', 'Political Sociology', 'Moral Philosophy', 'Ethics', 'Political Theory']"

We contend that the sensory provides a means of investigating how practices of social control extend far beyond our vision. Contrary to conventional understandings of how we identify, classify and process people defined as criminal – or ‘ways of looking’ – we draw on wider academic literature and empirical examples to illustrate how our broader sensory palate is equally implicated in social ordering. We consider what this does for our assumptions about how we produce knowledge, as well as how we go about altering our research methods to make the sensory both the focus of and the instrument of inquiry. The sensory, we argue, has always formed various modes of understanding which we are unaccustomed to echoing in our research practice.

During the past 110 years, language rights, among other minority rights, were either reluctantly granted or ignored. Although minority languages have been treated asymmetrically and incoherently, a particular pattern seems to have emerged: minority languages spoken by Christians (Vlach, Slavic languages, Arvanitika) are subject to assimilation dynamics, whereas minority languages spoken by non-Christians (Muslims, Jews) are governed by protection norms, with or without territorial criteria. This trend was shaped by international political influences and legal regulations through a very narrow perspective, which actually screened out any attempt at establishing non-territorial arrangements. Today, only one minority language enjoys special rights (mostly in the field of education), namely Turkish spoken by the Muslims of Thrace. Despite this, migratory flows after 1990, primarily from Albania, the former USSR and the Middle East, once again brought up the question of multiculturalism, language contact and language management. However, subsequent Greek governments have been reluctant to introduce special language rights for immigrants and refugees. Since Greece refrains from adhering to the main European legal instruments that safeguard language rights, such as the European Charter for Regional of Minority Languages or the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, the single protective mechanism granting linguistic rights remains the Treaty of Lausanne, which is limited to a specific minority language within a specific region. The legal protection of linguistic otherness in Greece was and still is fragmented and ambivalent, ranging from non-territorial autonomy invisibility to strict institutional territoriality.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Comparative Politics', 'Language Policy and Planning', 'Governance and Government', 'Political Science']"

From the 1940s until the 1960s, the “native labour question” became an increasingly politicized topic, involving a myriad of individuals, networks and institutions in the international realm. But it was also gradually addressed in a routinized way by the Portuguese administration, which increasingly incorporated concepts, standards and tools from international institutions in addressing colonial realities, especially labour-related abuses. This chapter, therefore, summarizes the main conclusions of the entire volume.","['History', 'Imperialism and Colonialism', 'Labor History', 'African History', 'History of Modern Europe', 'World History, Global and Transnational History']"

The prominent effect of gelling agent concentration in sheet formation and break-up is revealed. Sheet break-up is occurring in two different modes for five different gel concentrations. Waves generated from impingement point caused break-up of sheets for low-concentration gels and high-velocity jets while tearing and hole formation in sheets led to their break-up for mostly high-concentration gels and particularly for low jet velocity modes.

An experimental relationship between the root tensile strength and root diameter was developed. First, feature selection methods were applied to identify the critical characteristics affecting root tensile strength. Furthermore, the machine learning (ML) models were developed using individual methods (Sequential Minimal Optimization Regression (SMOreg), Instance-based Learning (IBk), Random Forest (RF), Linear Regression (LR), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)) and ensemble methods (ensemble via MLP and LR models). Results showed that the ensemble via the MLP outperformed all other individual models as well as the ensemble via the LR.

The review and analysis of the literature reveals that these people are widely subjected to discrimination and violence in all areas of their lives. This has been verified at an international level, identifying trans women and gender-flexible men or men who transgress the gender stereotypes of hegemonic masculinity as those who are most exposed to this violence. Moreover, the analysis of this discrimination and violence from a queer perspective highlights that these phenomena must be comprehended as being more than exclusively individual, conscious, and voluntaristic acts, setting them in the framework of social discourses about normal and abnormal identities. This study highlights the implications of this for the prevention of transphobia and violence toward trans and gender-flexible people.","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Emotion', 'Personality and Social Psychology']"

The main research contribution is that the study implements prognostic, morpho-functional models to automate the differential diagnostics process. Also, the research developed a special methodology for automating the differential diagnostics process using artificial neural networks based on predictive morpho-functional models. The system analysis method was applied. This method allows you to study analyzed problems and disease at various systems organization levels, including macro and micro levels to highlight the characteristics, symptoms, syndromes, and signs necessary for private diagnosis, and in the study, the use of algorithms for evaluating the results dispersion was further developed, which made it possible to assess the informativeness of signs about the corresponding nosological disease form. The methods and techniques for treating the disease were analyzed. A faster and more reliable method was proposed for monitoring the food effect on the gastroesophageal reflux disease reaction. Statistical processing of the research results is carried out. The reliability of the data is shown. For a more reliable further diagnosis, machine learning of the biotechnical disease monitoring system was carried out. The machine is properly trained and classifies the image. Regression analysis showed the model reliability built using machine learning. After conducting experiments and subsequent analysis of the results, we obtained an accuracy of 99%. The system has correctly learned to classify data. Regression analysis showed an almost linear regression.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In the British case, classic examples include anti-slavery, radicalism, Chartism, free trade and women’s suffrage. Yet the new forms of mass collective petitioning that emerged in the late-eighteenth century are best regarded as neutral technologies rather than the exclusive property of liberals and radicals. Many of the largest mobilisations of petitions and signatures to Parliament and other authorities in the nineteenth century came from conservative, tory, loyalist, anti-reform or reactionary campaigns, seeking to resist major constitutional changes or oppose the demands made by progressive movements. An analysis of these campaigns reveals that conservative petitioning was generally reactive, responding to proposed changes and opponents rather than attempting to set the agenda. The practice of petitioning within such petition movements made greater use of established bodies, such as clergy and the church, and was rather slower to develop new forms of association and adopt the new modes of mass petitioning than their opponents. For example, for a long time conservatives continued to emphasise the respectability and quality of signatures and petitioners, even after numbers had become increasingly important in the public debates over petitions on key issues. The use of petitioning to resist change was also significant in maintaining conservative identity during a period (after 1830) when the Tory or Conservative party was weak. Overall, the engagement of conservatives shows how they adapted, if not to democracy, then to popular politics in the nineteenth century.","['History', 'Social History', 'Political History', 'European History', 'Modern History', 'World History, Global and Transnational History']"

Telemedicine cannot not work as an autonomous service, rather, ought to be subjected to different regulations having complex ethical, medico-legal manifestations. As far as India is concerned, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India (MoHFW) is the body responsible for initiating the policy of digitization of healthcare. However the point is—how far digital health services going appropriately in India. Based on NDHB’s comprehensive architectural framework of “Federated National Health Information System” in January 2020 and as the pandemic strategy Medical Council of India and the NITI Aayog released new guidelines on telemedicine with respect to registered medical practitioners, this research needed to be checked. Thus, the examination was done in these aspects. Guidelines were revisited to see how the hospitals in Delhi and NOIDA function based on the records submitted in medical consultation given to patients using telemedicine. It is felt that telemedicine being a nebulous concept in India, it needs to be analyzed in the light of prospective opportunities it would offer. There is a need for collaborative approaches on digital health, revision in the prevailing legal and ethical frameworks, the clinical practices corresponding to standing medical guidelines. Also, it is found that there exist no uniform telemedicine practices balancing the privacy norms, medico-legal responsibility and regulatory standards. To arrive at conclusion, the best practices prevailed in other countries are examined and adopted. It is felt that the policies existing in telemedicine need to be bifurcated as digital consultation, digital photography, remote patient monitoring (RPM) separately.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Some authors suggested that psychopathic traits are difficult to treat and that therapeutic strategies may even worsen psychopathic traits, contributing to help young offenders to attain their antisocial behaviors in more successful ways. In turn, other authors argue that psychopathic traits are treatable, especially if identified during early stages of development (childhood or adolescence) and treated properly. This chapter intends to provide a review on robust studies testing the efficacy of (psycho)therapeutic interventions in reducing psychopathic traits among young offenders. Although scarce and limited, some of these studies provide promising results for the treatment of psychopathic traits among this high-risk population. One study found that multisystemic therapy (MST) was effective in reducing parent ratings of psychopathic traits among young offenders. Another study found that the PSYCHOPATHY.COMP program (an individual intervention based on Compassion Focused Therapy that was specifically tailored to reduce psychopathic traits as antisocial behavior through the promotion of a compassionate motivation) was able to reduce psychopathic traits, disruptive behavior, and to promote a compassionate motivation among young offenders (moderate to large effect sizes). Results on the efficacy of the PSYCHOPATHY.COMP also found that increases in self-compassion and decreases in fears of receiving compassion from others were crucial mechanisms for the reduction of psychopathic traits. Given the clinical and societal toll of psychopathic traits and related antisocial behavior in young offenders, there is an urgent need to develop evidence-based interventions, tailored to the specific mental health needs and characteristics of this high-risk population, contributing to the delivery of evidence-based treatments for the juvenile justice systems.","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Emotion', 'Personality and Social Psychology']"

Microbial-based products, especially biofertilizers and biopesticides, are known to be effective green alternatives to overcome adverse effect of chemical fertilizer and pesticides caused during green revolution. However, in India usage of such microbial-based products in agriculture is still at a very small scale. To overcome this issue, the Indian government has encouraged the use of biofertilizers and biopesticides by placing them into many of the agricultural schemes. Although, legal barriers imposed on their manufacturing, trade, import, storage, transport, and disposal restrict their production and adaptability hence, the declining interest of farmers have become a matter of concern. The main objective of this chapter is to highlight the legal provisions of the Indian laws regulating biofertilizers and biopesticides.

In order to deal with attitude and angular velocity constraints concurrently, two types of logarithmic potential functions are proposed, where the ineffective attitude constraints are excluded in the design of attitude potential function by introducing a warning angle. In addition, we also designed a projection operator-based adaptive law to estimate the upper bounds of the inertia uncertain parameters and the environmental disturbances, so that the estimation process conforms to the physical meaning of the parameters. Combining the two potential functions and the parameters adaptation law, an adaptive controller is constructed to asymptotically stabilize the attitude reorientation error while satisfying the attitude and the angular velocity constraints. Simulation example of an uncertain spacecraft with rest-to-rest attitude maneuver subject to constraints on attitude and angular velocity is carried out, and the obtained results verify the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive attitude controller.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Control and Systems Theory']"

This program served as an overlay to the traditional family law paradigm of private attorneys and self-represented litigants. In the 1980s and 1990s, the program’s collection efforts broadened in scope beyond children receiving welfare to all children of two-parent households. The enforcement emphasis tilted the scales against those who are least able to pay—low-income noncustodial parents. The collection focus is currently switching to account for the financial hardships and travails that follow most adults, particularly fathers, and tailoring solutions fair to both parents. Many child-support-related fatherhood engagement programs address access and visitation issues and overcoming barriers that may limit fathers’ interactions with their children. Studies indicate that children’s adult success can be correlated to positive paternal contact (McLanahan et al. Ann Rev Sociol. 39:399–427. https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-071312-145704 , 2013).

Only membrane and bending parts are taken into account in the formulation, whereas the transverse shear strains are neglected. By using the variational principle, the weak form of equilibrium equations is derived. Then, the displacement and strain of the FGM skew plate are discretized using a four nodes finite element leading to the construction of the geometric and material stiffness matrices. The critical buckling load is determined, then by the resolution of the eigenvalue problem. Two types of thermal loadings, namely uniform and non-uniform temperature rises through the thickness direction are taken into account. The thermomechanical properties of the FGM skew plate are temperature-dependent and can vary continuously through the thickness direction of the constituents according to a power- law distribution. Different numerical simulations are performed, where the validity of the formulation is first checked through a comparative study. Next, parametric analysis is carried out. The influence of several important parameters such as power-law index, thermal effects and skew angle is presented and discussed. It is concluded that these parameters play a significant role in the thermomechanical buckling response of FGM skew plates.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Materials Engineering', 'Classical and Continuum Physics']"

This means the initiatives to tackle migration as a political issue through recognition of framing, facts, accurate information, data and communications tools as key features in the debates. It is also a shift to acknowledging, directly and indirectly, that states, as the main subjects of international law and the ones with the responsibility to respect, protect and fulfil human rights and can be held more accountable for their actions in tackling e.g. disinformation and radical right discourses against human rights. The chapter illustrates this through selected cases, such as recent initiatives of the EU Fundamental Rights Agency and the UN Global Compact for Safe and Orderly Migration.

As a result, numerical predictions and observations were quite similar in terms of the front position, the velocity, volume, and momentum of debris flows. Even when applied to natural mountain slope with complicated terrain, numerical results and observations had good agreement with each other. As a result, the proposed combined method for landslides and debris flows overcomes the problem of separating the landslides analysis and the debris flow simulation. Especially, the proposed method can analyze the effects of rainfall on entrainments by debris flows as well as rainfall-induced landslides and the behavior of debris flows.","['Engineering', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Building Materials']"

Since the inaugural “gender quota election” of 2016, the number of women candidates contesting general elections has increased by 90% while the number of women elected has increased by 44%. Yet, in 2022, men outnumber  women by a ratio of 3.44:1 in Dáil Eireann (the lower house of parliament). This chapter discusses the implementation of legislative gender quotas in Ireland. It shows that political parties have met the letter of the law in fielding the requisite numbers of women candidates, but questions remain as to the extent to which the spirit of the law has been embraced to  transform candidate selection processes within political parties. The chapter argues that legislative gender quotas should therefore be understood as the start rather than the culmination of efforts to achieve gender equality within political parties in Ireland. But beyond political parties, we conclude that the introduction of candidate gender quotas in Ireland flagged a significant shift in political culture, which carried through into later political reforms on the unresolved issue of abortion and the newer issue of marriage equality.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Politics and Gender', 'Gender Studies', 'Comparative Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Public Administration']"

The multi-robotics system (MRS) can be considered as a cyber-physical system (CPS) in which the cyber and control layers are synthesized systematically. The infinite-time convergence, limited robustness, poor steady-state performance, and large chattering amplitude are the main drawbacks of the conventional sliding mode control (CSMC). Due to these drawbacks, the use of CSMC for developing the tracking controller becomes impractical. To tackle these issues effectively, an integral fast terminal sliding variable is employed in place of linear sliding variable that ensures the tracking error finite-time convergence during sliding mode. To deal the chattering issues, a third-order super-twisting control law is used as a robust term that makes the control continuous. The Lyapunov theory has been utilized for investigating the stability in finite time of an entirely closed-loop system. Finally, the performance and efficacy of the proposed approach are examined by conducting numerous numerical simulations under CPS and without the CPS framework.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Big Data', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks']"

The purpose of this study is to investigate the characteristics of water transfer in sound and cracked cement-based materials. Water absorption tests are performed considering initial saturation, damage crack, and water-cement ratio. Numerical models based on assumption of diffusion mechanism are proposed and solved by finite element method, and different constitutive models are employed and verified. The results show that water absorptivity is intensely affected by initial saturation and damage cracks. Besides, on the basis of diffusion equation, the linear relationship between cumulative water absorption and square root of time is found to be rigidly satisfied whatever the formula of diffusion coefficient.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Waste Management/Waste Technology', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Environment, general']"

The first and major interventions occurred at the local level, where in 2001 quotas were adopted for regional and municipal elections. Since then, the Italian parties gradually shifted from a voluntary quota system to a regulatory one. How did the legislative gender quotas affect the party processes of recruitment, selection, and list preparation? And how do Italian parties interpret the issue of equal representation? Is it merely a bureaucratic procedure or a real commitment to enhance female representation? The chapter studies how the major political parties organized the processes of candidate recruitment, selection, and list preparation for municipal elections, with a special focus on the case of the Province of Trento. The research results showcase degrees of variation between parties with regard to their selection mechanisms, and in their interpretations of the roles women play within the party. It is argued that the party’s culture and organizational structure are the key factors, which, taken together, affect the effective implementation of party gender quotas.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Politics and Gender', 'Gender Studies', 'Comparative Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Public Administration']"

A Case Study of UK Commercial vs Islamic Bank,OriginalPaper,"This empirical study aims to examine the customer awareness and experience in both commercial and Islamic banks in the UK. It pays attention to the quality of services and the available support given to the customers. Banks pride in their financial services and support for customers. The banks’ mantra is about treating customers as priced assets and providing them with all the necessary support and guidance. Undoubtedly, the customers’ awareness of what the banks offer to them in terms of money safety, transfers, loans and interest rates are very important. The study utilises a questionnaire and focus group of 18 respondents with customers who use both banks to gain an understanding of their experiences. Evidence suggests that there is a general understanding of the banks’ services and commercial banks in particular expose their services more widely using various communication channels. The study found that some customers are aware of the specific charges and the interest rates. However, some were unaware of the services offered by the Islamic banks in relation to mortgage and interest rates and this had impact on customers’ satisfaction and loyalty. The study concludes that both commercial and Islamic banks need to do more to increase their customers services provisions in order to attract and retain existing customers. Offering customers and making them aware of a range of products and services tailored to their needs is way forward to acquire new and to increase customer retention.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

On the one hand, journalism and research have exposed nationalistic motives with direct antecedents in prewar imperialistic indoctrination. On the other hand, planned moral education contributes to the experience and character formation of all Japanese children through every grade of compulsory education. Academic research approaching the school ethnographically has consistently praised the child-centered moral atmosphere and democratic practice in schools. Moreover, moral education is currently undergoing its greatest reform since its postwar introduction over sixty years ago. While providing an outline of moral education in Japan and some of its contemporary challenges along four strands of research, this chapter identifies two disjoints in research that have led to misconceptions and produced these seemingly contradictory findings. More specifically, current research on moral education tends to study policy through official documents, inviting assumptions about classroom practice, and tends to focus on the curriculum category and dedicated classtime labeled “moral education,” overlooking moral learning elsewhere in the curriculum. On the other hand, studies of the whole curriculum tend not to speak in the language of moral learning. Joining up the dots between strands of research on policy and practice not only overcomes misconceptions to reach a more nuanced understanding of moral education, but also holds theoretical implications. Understanding the broad taught curriculum of moral education in Japan clears the path for studies that contribute to the general theorization of moral education.","['Education', 'International and Comparative Education', 'Education, general']"

These issues are the typical wastefulness in public investment of Vietnamese construction industry. Many researches on the issues have been conducted but their research orientation has commonly focused on project implementation phase or closing phase rather than pre-construction phase. It is interesting to note that the three primary phases in a Vietnamese project life cycle are highly likely fit in the three phases in Juran Trilogy Diagram, namely quality planning, quality control and quality improvement. This also concludes that a lower quality of feasibility study report in preparation phase will result in a lot of wasted money in successional phases and vice versa. The overall aim of this research, therefore, is to improve quality in performance of the feasibility study reports of new construction projects for which public budgets are being allocated efficiently. The two main research objectives are to find out factors or attributes affecting quality management of feasibility study reports in public investment affairs of Group-B or higher projects and to integrate appropriately the so-called “best practice” feasibility study model from western countries into Vietnamese construction industry.

A sliding surface using the information of mismatched disturbance estimates has been developed to ensure the desired system behaviour. Furthermore, a power rate proportional reaching law has been employed to guarantee the finite time reaching of the sliding variable with improved convergence speed. Besides, it also helps in mitigating the chattering phenomena. A novel NDO is proposed for estimating the unknown bounded matched and mismatched external disturbances. The proposed composite observer–controller methodology provides the asymptotic convergence of the tracking error and counteracts the effect of the external disturbances. The closed-loop asymptotic system stability has been proven using Lyapunov stability criteria. The proposed scheme has the ability to provide robustness with a smaller switching gain that results in chattering attenuation further. A simulation study has been done to check the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and simulation results demonstrate the nominal tracking performance with control accuracy. To show the superiority of the proposed methodology, results have been compared with conventional SMC.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Big Data', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks']"

We briefly review the literature pertinent to parents’ advocacy, views of, and attitudes toward inclusion. We also review the literature about teachers’ attitudes toward inclusion, focusing on systematic reviews revealing nuanced views of inclusion and not monolithic attitudes. Nuanced views in both parental and teachers’ perspectives may indicate that effective instruction and appropriate education (as mandated by law in the USA) should take precedence over the place of instruction (bodily inclusion).

In the International Labour Organization, new standards emerged regulating labour and social policies in “non-metropolitan territories”. This chapter focuses on the ways Portuguese imperial and colonial officials interacted with, and reacted to, these political, legal, and institutional transformations in the immediate post-war years. Overall, they regarded international efforts to expand social rights or to outright eliminate forced labour in colonial settings with suspicion. Officials and experts shared the belief that “native” workers were essentially different from their European counterparts. As such, “special” juridical regimes were still needed in the colonies. In the meantime, local reports and news continued to arrive in imperial and colonial offices pointing to the persistence of forced labour in Portuguese African colonies. These dynamics fed imperial anxieties about the possibility of international normative integration. But international labour standards, associated mechanisms, languages and norms gradually became incorporated into the daily routine of administrative officials.","['History', 'Imperialism and Colonialism', 'Labor History', 'African History', 'History of Modern Europe', 'World History, Global and Transnational History']"

An exact solution of the differential equation of free vibrations of plates when the bedding coefficient is an arbitrary continuous function of one variable is found. The quadratures for numerical realization of the found solutions are derived. The formulas for dynamic state parameters, which allow one to investigate free vibrations of the plates under any boundary conditions at two parallel edges, are obtained. The dependence of the frequency of free vibrations of the system under consideration on its other parameters is established in the analytical form. Computational formulas for determining the spectrum of frequencies of free vibrations of the plates are obtained. The general form of frequency equation and formulas for the main forms of vibrations corresponding to the three cases of boundary conditions are established. Frequency spectra of free vibrations of hinged plates resting on a variable elastic base for four different laws of bedding coefficient changes are determined. It is shown that in the case of constant bedding coefficient the frequencies calculated by the author’s method practically coincide with the frequencies calculated by the known exact formula.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis']"

With globalization and overwhelming evidence of increased productivity when a diverse workforce is in place, it is paradoxical to notice the difficulties in linking practices and rhetoric in organizations with such evidence. The issue becomes more apparent when government grand narratives, particularly in the capitalist world, call for migrant labor to help industry and nation building. Yet, not sufficient institutional structures are put in place, nor their implementation adequately enforced to guarantee long-term adequate and sustainable well-being for a large number of newcomer groups who are then racialized and ghettoized. This raises questions of whether racism and disadvantage are consciously normalized in so-called democratic systems which profess equality in their philosophical and political rhetoric. The rest of the chapter expands on Western thought and its contradictions about race, the construction and normalization of racism through colonial practices as well as the issue of systemic racism and its normalization in contemporary workplaces and labor relations. These themes running in the help to lay out the case for a hypernormalization of racism, including its manifestations, meanings, and effects.","['Business and Management', 'Management', 'Organization']"

We start from the premise that the current social services system encounters serious difficulties when trying to respond to, and transform, the different problems facing a social reality greatly impacted by injustice and social inequality. The commitment to greater democracy is therefore inevitable from the point of view of what was supposed to be one of the fundamental pillars of the welfare system. A review of some documents and access to some survey data afford an opportunity to discuss what we have called “greater community”/“intensified community”, understood as a strategy allowing social services to develop a model based on participation and community perspective as preferential lines of intervention. The defence of this intensified community allows us to recognize the importance of working with the community towards the construction of active citizenship, this being understood as a fundamental condition for developing democracy. Following an overview of the main postulates supporting this interpretation, a brief summary of the reality of the Basque social services system is provided with the aim to outline the scope of greater community proposed herein.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Public Policy']"

Janša government’s responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have largely focused on the economy and been linked to change on the macro level—changing the system of government from democracy towards an authoritarian style of governing. While the extraordinary circumstances have given the new government an opportunity to limit citizens’ rights and alter the political system’s practical functioning, a mix of state and non-state actors has been working to counter the second republic project’s success. Although the policy priority of the economy may have allowed for a short-term curtailing of economic costs, the move towards authoritarian rule has overall impacted negatively on the way the health crisis has been managed.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Comparative Politics']"

We now understand that it is not enough to conserve, we need to regenerate. That regeneration goes through two different paradigm changes. The first takes into account upscaling plans. That concept is based on the fact that restoration to regenerate ecosystems is on the verge, but there is a lack of a good plan to create large-scale animal and plant forest restoration programs in different areas of the oceans. The second paradigm is the participation of people, but not only as volunteers; the restoration plans need them as customers. The first paradigm is closely linked to the second. There has to be a business model that allows, in part, to pay for conservation and restoration, which, in turn, will allow for regeneration. However, we are not talking about a privatization process, as has sometimes been attempted. It is not about allowing access only to those who can afford it. Is about making people of different economic statuses and possibilities a part of the process of restoring, and giving them a real return in terms of awareness, education and enthusiasm related to the enhancement and recovery of biodiversity and complexity. People are willing to pay to maintain that complexity, that beauty, that diversity of animals and plants. Tourism can, therefore, make a difference in new conservation plans. It is not enough to expand marine protected areas, we must provide financial mechanisms so that the surveillance and infrastructure of the area we want to regenerate can be maintained. At the same time that this area is preserved, it can be replanted. Methods to quantify biodiversity, calculate the metabolism of the system and recover degraded areas with underwater gardening exist. It is demonstrated, for example, in the advances made in transplant methods for phanerogams, the environmental DNA to calculate the biodiversity of the area, and the calculations on the state of health of a coral reef. However, technology and great advances are not enough. We need to implement an inclusive policy in which local people, especially indigenous people, help in both conservation and restoration processes. They are the first that want (and need) to maintain or recover the lost habitats, but in many cases the policy makers and some stakeholders do not consider them in the equation. We must create those conditions of synergy in which the academic world, the political world and society itself (local and foreign) come together to solve the problems related to the loss of ecosystem services in the oceans.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"

Nutraceuticals and functional food sector are evolving as a popular segment owing to the increasing awareness of the people towards good health. Another driver for its growth is the factors like unhealthy lifestyle, less exercise, and workouts, which make the dependence on nutraceuticals and functional foods inevitable. It is claimed by many that the Indian nutraceuticals and functional food market are yet to experience the exponential growth. This exaggerates the need and importance of the regulations specific to the nutraceuticals and functional foods. Historically, in India, the food laws were highly ambiguous and the regulations related to this segment were at the back seat, but with the introduction of Food Safety Standards (FSS) Act, 2006, a special emphasis is being given to the regulations of nutraceuticals and functional foods. The nutraceuticals and functional foods that are imported into India also need compliance with the Food Safety Standards (FSS) Act and its rules and regulations. Although the FSS Act 2006 is reforming in terms of compliance and ease to the operators, there still is the need of significant expansion of this act, in order to increase the impact of this law in the whole functional food and nutraceutical industry of India.","['Chemistry', 'Food Science', 'Food Microbiology', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

It is aalso important at the level of regulatory and supervisory authorities. In this regard, many of those interested in the Islamic banking industry and those practicing the profession of Sharīʻah audit are looking forward to crystallizing the idea of unifying the frame of reference for the Sharīʻah pronouncements (fatwā) that are issued by the Sharīʻah supervisory boards of regional and international Islamic financial institutions. This study discusses the topic of establishing a juristic frame of reference, which refers to unifying the juristic frame of reference by relying on all the credible fatwā of Islamic banks that have been issued by various Sharīʻah supervisory boards in a country or a jurisdiction and all the Sharīʻah standards that have been issued by the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial institutions (AAOIFI). The topic of unifying the juristic frame of reference does not refer in any way whatsoever to the issue of unifying the juristic opinions, since it is completely different from the concept of unifying juristic opinions. Based on the problem statement, the objectives of the study has been determined, which aim to identify the concept of juristic frame of reference, its nature and relationship with Islamic financial institutions. Moreover, the study will analyze the obstacles of unifying the juristic frame of reference within the Islamic banking system and its effectiveness in any Islamic financial institution. In this context, the study reached a number of conclusions and recommendations, namely the need for the regulatory and supervisory authorities to impose the implementation of Sharīʻah and accounting standards issued by AAOIFI and in the event a Sharīʻah board of an Islamic financial institution did not follow a certain standard, disclosure should be made about such an incident. There is also the need to establish a supreme Sharīʻah board in the central bank that is tasked with providing guidance and identifying the preponderant view when different Sharīʻah boards of Islamic financial institutions differ on an issue not to unify the fatwā, but to support it with juristic evidence with the aim of disseminating knowledge among the new students.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Sustainable Development']"

Accurate mathematical modeling for continuous flow heating systems creates a powerful tool to be used in simulation software and allows to run the tests and validations in a virtual world, to speed up the control system project and find a better solution with low cost.

Their respective philosophies have had their major impact, however, in the late nineteenth century and twentieth century. For reasons that are both historical and systematical, the later Schelling (after 1809) and Schopenhauer were not deemed valuable interlocutors in the post-Kantian debates of the early nineteenth century. The reason for this, I argue, is that they go against the idealistic flow of the times. Instead of developing Kant’s positive concept of autonomy as self-grounding reason (such as Hegel), they expand Kant’s notion of a free arbitrariness (Willkür; most often translated as power of choice). I wonder: When one goes against the flow, does one then not return to the source? In this paper, I show how Schopenhauer and Schelling (1809–1815) both start from Kant’s negative concept of freedom and develop a way to experience such freedom through a non-conceptual intimation.","['Philosophy', 'German Idealism', 'Continental Philosophy', 'History of Philosophy']"

However, the livelihoods of these traders, and the governance constraints they encounter, are not well-understood outside of the region’s capital and primate cities. This study focuses on two distinct secondary cities in Nigeria, Calabar in the South-South geopolitical zone of the country and Minna in the Middle Belt region. Interviews were collected with local and state officials in each city on the legal, institutional, and oversight functions they provide within the informal food sector. This was complemented with a survey of approximately 1097 traders across the two cities to assess their demographic profile, contributions to food security, key challenges they face for profitability, engagement with government actors, and degree of access to services in the markets. The analysis highlights two main findings. First, informal traders report less harassment by government actors than has been observed in larger Nigerian cities. At the same time, however, the enabling environment is characterized by benign neglect whereby government-mandated oversight functions are not comprehensively implemented and service delivery gaps remain a major hindrance to food safety. Second, there are important differences in the needs of traders across cities, suggesting that policies focused on food safety and improving the livelihoods of this constituency more broadly need to be properly nuanced even at the subnational level.","['Social Sciences', 'Human Geography', 'Urban Studies/Sociology', 'Public Policy', 'Sustainable Development', 'Environmental Policy', 'Sociology, general']"

Such autonomy allowed them to control the public message about the intervention. American FPE made high-profile public speeches to obtain support from the public and the legislature, whereas the latter stopped talking about the intervention to avoid a meaningful debate. Even if these executives adopted different communication strategies, both managed comparable fiscal resources to undertake their COIN strategy.

However, despite evidence that father involvement is a critical component of child well-being and an integral part of a family system, the child welfare system struggles to engage fathers. Furthermore, father engagement with and participation in child welfare processes and services is low. Additionally, efforts by child welfare agencies to engage fathers and fathers’ participation in engaged services is not well recorded in child welfare data reporting systems. To assist social workers and child welfare caseworkers in more fully engaging fathers, we explore research on father engagement in child welfare services, including studies on engagement activities, associations with child welfare outcomes, and barriers to engagement.

For conventional oil-based (diesel) and gas-oil synthetic drilling fluids, Bingham model can better characterize their rheological properties. However, there is little research on the fluctuating pressure in eccentric annulus for Bingham fluid. In this paper, a novel model to calculate the fluctuating pressure in eccentric annulus for Bingham fluid was established. And, the self-adaptive Simpson integral method was used to solve the model. In addition, the model was verified by the classical Burkhardt model in concentric annulus and indoor experiment results in eccentric annulus. Moreover, the variation laws of fluctuating pressure under different factors were investigated. Here are some significant findings, (1) the maximum relative error between the established model and Burkhardt model is less than 8.9% in concentric annulus. And, the maximum relative error between the established model and indoor experiment results is less than 9.2% in eccentric annulus. (2) The fluctuating pressure gradient is negatively correlated with eccentricity, but positively correlated with size ratio of string to hole and dynamic shear stress. (3) In deviated wellbores and horizontal wellbores with large eccentricity, the tripping speed can be appropriately increased to reduce the non-production time. (4) In slim hole with narrow gap of annulus, the tripping speed should be strictly controlled to avoid excessive or too small wellbore pressure.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Computational Science and Engineering', 'Theoretical, Mathematical and Computational Physics']"

The article examines dematerialization as a transition between old and new ways of designing; In this current transition, there is a feeling of loss.

The proposed model extends the classical one-dimensional formulation of the Burgers creep model to a fully 3D model and also introduces the non-linearity of the model parameters observed by Houhou et al. The creep behaviour of a double lap shear test specimen is then simulated with this numerical approach. A major result is that creep induces a redistribution of the interfacial shear stress along with the concrete/CFRP lap joint, leading both to a reduction in the peak stress near the loaded end of the adhesive joint and an increase in the effective transfer length.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Building Materials']"

Since then the basic principle has not been developed substantially further, although modern democracies have invented improvements. The objective of this paper is to introduce a new understanding principle into the direction of a technology driven democracy. After a problem focused analysis we use the axiomatic systemic method and natural language logic argumentation for a basic system construction for a new general system of democracy in general by the personalization of nations or states and more specific as an illustration by division of state dimensions into (a) person mapping and (b) territory. The personalized state or nation culminates then in a world-nation-trade-map, for personal implementation of market value oriented nation selection. This leads then, when technologically implemented, to the ability of every person in the world to choose every traded nation to be its future valued member. This further development of democracy means then effectively a phase reversal of world to nation into the human right direction of the individual, by this fulfilling highest ethical standards and giving back the control of the world to each individual and personal responsibility, by making possible the choice of being part of his favourite nation or state. Although this is only a very short sketch of a new kind of higher ordered democracy, we invite people from all over the world to join this vision into the human right direction of peace- and powerful humanity.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This study reviewed the construction accidents court cases in refurbishment and demolition work in Hong Kong from 1990 to 2019 in the legal databases Westlaw Asia and LexisHK. It found that some victims preferred to take risks, indicating low hazard awareness, while others were ignorant and did not know the causes of the accidents even after their injuries. Furthermore, many employers’ hazard awareness is low because they do not aware of hazardous areas. Some supervisors did not instruct their employees to use the protective equipment even though it is provided. As we may some construction sites have already utilised robots with weak artificial intelligence, this article raised a futuristic question regarding the hazard awareness responsibility of autonomous robots with strong artificial intelligence.","['Engineering', 'Fire Science, Hazard Control, Building Safety', 'Building Construction and Design']"

The reports timing and languages used in reporting by all listed companies were obtained from ASE website. This included a comprehensive listing of 171 companies from all economic sectors. The study used SPSS to analyze data, and the simple t-test to evaluate the hypotheses. The results showed that the majority of listed companies (89.5%) have complied, and reported in XBRL format in 2021. However, there was a significant delay in reporting reached 29.01 days in average (spanning from just few days to up to 242 days). This first year experience in XBRL reporting gives good indication that Jordanian companies did not face major obstacles, or have inadequate technology or qualified financial statement preparers to cope with the new reporting requirement. Furthermore, considering Coronavirus Pandemic impact, an initial result, indicates no significant difference in the mean delay in XBRL reporting between the government-declared most hurt economic sectors (Specifically the Hotels and Tourism and Transportation sectors) and one of the economic sectors that was not declared as such (banking sector).

Therefore, there is a need to optimize the structure of the energy balance of the state, based on the requirements of energy security and ensure the share of renewable energy at 25%. However, with the development of renewable energy sources (RESs) there is a problem of ensuring the appropriate maneuverability of the power system. This is due to the fact that the structure of generating capacity of the United Power System of Ukraine in terms of effective regulation of frequency and power in the power system is suboptimal. Among the reasons for this, the main ones are unregulated and variable operation of a SPP, which is exacerbated by the lack of tools and approaches for the power generation modes forecasting. That is why the issue of accurate forecasting of the possible electricity generation volume has become acute. However, solar energy forecasting is a rather difficult task, as it largely depends on climatic conditions that change over time. This study presents an analysis and application of the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) method to develop a model that can support and provide forecasting the amount of power produced by SPP. Data for the development of the model were obtained from the time series of electricity generation on the example of the SPP in the village of Velyka Dymerka, Kyiv region. The data consisted of more than 26 thousand samples collected from July 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020, which characterize the operating conditions of solar panels with a capacity of 9 MW. This led to the choice of the SARIMA model. The coefficient of determination (R 2 ) for the obtained model was 92%. This indicates the ability of the final model to accurately represent and give forecast based on data set of the SPP power generation.","['Energy', 'Energy Systems', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Control and Systems Theory']"

Over the course of the pandemic, a debate has emerged about the appropriate democratic and technopolitical response when governments use disease surveillance technologies to tackle the spread of COVID-19, pointing out the dichotomy between state-Leviathan cybercontrol and civil liberties. The COVID-19 pandemic has inevitably raised the need to resiliently and technopolitically respond to democratic threats that hyperconnected and highly virialised societies produce. In order to shed light on this debate, amidst this volume on “democratic deepening”, this chapter introduces the new term “postpandemic technopolitical democracy” as a way to figure out emerging forms and scales for developing democracy and citizen participation in hyperconnected and highly virialised postpandemic societies. Insofar as the digital layer cannot be detached from the current democratic challenges of the twenty-first century including neoliberalism, scales, civic engagement, and action research-driven co-production methodologies; this chapter suggests a democratic toolbox encompassing four intertwined factors including (i) the context characterised by the algorithmic nations, (ii) challenges stemming from data sovereignty, (iii) mobilisation seen from the digital rights perspective, and (iv) grassroots innovation embodied through data cooperatives.

The computational representation of the building employs the beam-truss model (BTM) for the walls and floor slabs. The BTM allows capturing the cyclic inelastic behavior of RC walls and slabs, while being conceptually simpler than, e.g., continuum finite element models. Nonlinear static and dynamic analyses are conducted. The latter consider a set of triaxial ground motions scaled at two intensity levels, namely, those of the design earthquake and the risk-targeted maximum considered earthquake (MCE r ). The analyses provide insights into the evolution of structural system damage and lateral strength degradation, while also elucidating the complex interaction between the webs and flanges of the core wall and the system effects associated with coupling between the walls, beams, slabs, and columns. The potentially detrimental effect of the multidirectional nature of the seismic motion on the inelastic deformability of the wall components is also demonstrated. The implications of the obtained results, in the context of the currently employed performance-based seismic design procedures in the United States, are also discussed.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Structural Materials', 'Sustainable Development', 'Mathematical Modeling and Industrial Mathematics']"

Citizen science has been shown to be a very good tool for providing useful data for scientists, if well directed. For example, the monitoring of invasive species is impossible to do from research institutes due to lack of money, tools and personnel. But well trained, even sporadic tourists can give useful information about their distribution. This is also true in the case of rare or endangered species, or in migrations or the detection of anomalies. They can also be useful in tracking marine litter, not only helping to clean beaches and seabed, but also observing the origin of that waste thanks to photos or collections that can be used to understand where the objects come from. Other observations and data collection are more complex, and require specialists to make adequate quantitative observations, but may still benefit from broad support from people who want to help in the logistical part. Once again, indigenous people are put in the spotlight, because they help to solve many problems thanks to their great local wisdom. We are realizing that many of the things we do to monitor and give keys for conservation are provided by local populations who have lived in, protected or managed the areas we want to study for hundreds of years or millennia. That is why it is important to accelerate the follow-up processes by broadening the spectrum of people who can help in these processes, professionals and non-professionals alike. However, there are limits. Specialist teams are still needed to do sampling, monitoring or experiments. The tools used by scientific research teams to make such monitoring programs have substantially advanced. The technology to keep track of the problems we have in the oceans has made a really important qualitative leap. For example, although attempts have been made to track oil spills in certain circumstances, only the collection of data by specialists can help to understand the origin of contaminants. Coastal and ocean governance needs a paradigm change. We need co-governance processes in which democratic decisions, education and awareness-raising fit together. The models in which people interact with science, problems and solutions about the oceans are more and more demanded, and the last two decades have been crucial. An authentic bottom-up process in which all these advances and the different ways of observing nature and the impacts suffered are available to non-specialists.

The limited capacity of shelters to meet their needs is forcing many to turn to transit vehicles, bus stops, and transit stations for shelter. The pandemic only exacerbated the homelessness crisis. Fear of infection in shelters and reduced capacity due to physical distancing requirements drove more unhoused people to take shelter on the streets and also in transit settings. Although discussions in the popular media have raised awareness of homelessness in transit environments, the scale of the problem has not been well-documented in scholarly research. This chapter investigates the intersection of the pandemic, transit, and homelessness in U.S. cities, presenting the results of a survey of 115 transit operators on issues of homelessness on their systems, both before and during the coronavirus pandemic. We find that homelessness is broadly present across transit systems though mostly concentrated on larger transit systems and central hotspots, and it has worsened during the pandemic. The challenges of homelessness are deepening, and dedicated funding and staff are rare. Attempting to respond to the needs of homeless riders, some agencies have put forth innovative responses, including hubs of services, mobile outreach, discounted fares, and transportation to shelters.","['Engineering', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Urban Studies/Sociology', 'Public Policy', 'Cities, Countries, Regions', 'Epidemiology']"

A news release from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in 2020 revealed over 40,000 people were declared missing in Africa. A staggering percentage of that number, a little over 23,000, is documented in Nigeria alone. Despite the numerous factors surrounding missing persons globally, at more than 50% of the original figure, it is unsurprising that most of the cases in Nigeria are attributed to the insurgency and security mishap that has plagued the country for almost a decade. Some of the cases remain unsolved for years, causing the victims to remain untraceable, thereby taking up a different identity and existence, especially if they went missing. Current solutions to find missing persons in Nigeria revolve around word of mouth, media and print announcements, and more recently, social media. These solutions are inefficacious, slow, and do not adequately help find and identify missing persons, especially in situations where time is a determining factor. The use of a facial recognition system with deep learning functionality can help Nigerian law enforcement agencies, and other human rights organizations and friends and families of the missing person speed up the search and find process.

doi:10.1007/978-3-030-79827-7_29,en,Resistive-Switching Memories,OriginalPaper,"In the past decades, resistive-switching random-access memory (RRAM) has been widely studied as one of the promising candidates for next-generation memory technologies. Recently, innovation research on the novel devices for new computing paradigms beyond von Neumann architecture is emerging with the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. With its natural features that can both store and process data, RRAM has been also extensively explored to implement for the new computing paradigms such as brain-inspired computing and in-memory computing. RRAM is a novel device that is based on resistive switching. It has a typical MIM structure where the resistive-switching layer is sandwiched between the top electrode (TE) and bottom electrode (BE). The resistive switching indicates that the device can be reversibly switched between high resistance state (HRS) and low resistance state (LRS). The resistive-switching process from HRS to LRS is called SET, and the reversible process from LRS to HRS is called as RESET. Two kinds of modes including unipolar and bipolar have been observed to switch RRAM. For a fresh RRAM, a so-called Forming process is usually required to achieve the reversible and repeated resistive-switching behaviors. Generally, the Forming voltage is much higher than the switching (SET and RESET) voltage. If the Forming voltage is close to the switching voltage, this RRAM is referred to as Forming-free device. For the physical origins of resistive switching in RRAM, the filament effect has been widely accepted. In this viewpoint, the resistive switching between HRS and LRS is due to the formation and rupture of conductive filament paths inside the resistive-switching layer. According to the composition of the conductive filament (CF), RRAM can be further classified into two types: (1) oxygen vacancy-based RRAM (Ox-RRAM) and (2) metal ion-based RRAM that is also called as conductive-bridge random-access memory (CBRAM). RRAM was initially proposed for the memory application as the next generation of nonvolatile memory candidate in the early 2000s. Especially, Samsung presented a paper at the International Electron Devices Meeting that demonstrated the highly scalable characteristics in NiO memory cells integrated with conventional complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) with a one-transistor–one-resistor (1T1R) device structure. That further intensified the research activity on RRAM. Up to now, significant technical advances have been achieved in the device performance and integration, including great scalability (<10 nm), fast speed (<1 ns), low operation voltage (<1.5 V) and current (<1 μA), high endurance (>1012 cycles), and long retention (>10 years at room temperature). The 3D integration approaches were also proposed for the high density of RRAM integration. The testing memory chips more than 16 G-bits have been reported and demonstrated. In 2008, HP group published a paper to establish the link between RRAM and “memristor,” where the concept of “memristor” was proposed and defined by L. Chua in the 1970s. Later, RRAM or memristor was proposed and demonstrated to implement the stateful logic, in which Boolean logic states were operated and stored in resistance of RRAM. In 2012, a collaboration work from Stanford University and Peking University reported a RRAM-based electronic synapse with multilevel states (>400 states) and ultra-low spiking energy (<1 pJ/per spiking) and then further demonstrated a 3D integration approach to achieve both high uniformity and low spiking energy in 2014. This strongly stimulates the RRAM research activities that extend RRAM to much wider areas beyond memory. Especially accompanying with the development of AI, the new computing paradigms beyond von Neumann such as brain-inspired computing are highly desired to overcome the bottleneck of so-called memory wall from the traditional von Neumann architecture. Research activity has been primarily driven by the search for ideal neuromorphic devices. RRAM was paid much more attention due to the featured functions of computing in memory, which is beneficial for the brain-inspired computing systems. More recently, while a lot of research efforts still remain focused on the device level, the demonstrations of the arrays in circuit/system level are increasingly common. Various RRAM array-based chips for both memory and brain-inspired computing applications were reported. In this chapter, we will review the latest advancements in RRAM. Firstly, the physical mechanism on resistive-switching characteristics of both Ox-RRAM and CBRAM are discussed in Sect. 29.2 . Then, the physics-based models and simulation methods are presented in Sect. 29.3 . In Sect. 29.4 , the array design and optimization technologies are addressed and discussed. The system applications of RRAM in emerged memory and novel computing paradigms for brain-inspired neural network are explored in Sect. 29.5 . Finally, the prospect of future technological trend is highlighted in Sect. 29.6 .","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Electronic Circuits and Devices', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation']"

Theft of intellectual property has also become a growing threat to our national security. By refusing to recognize these actions as criminal, other countries shield many of the individuals responsible for these crimes. This research aims to examine how countries, companies, and agencies deal with intellectual property theft and to provide a breakdown of how intellectual property theft affects today’s industries and the damage it can cause. When intellectual property thefts do occur, it is important to understand the necessary steps to handle the situation and how professionals go about collecting evidence from these crimes.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This chapter argues that in Emma , Austen draws upon Ovid’s myth of Pygmalion in Book 10 of the Metamorphoses , the tale of a sculptor who brings his statue to life and marries her. Subverting expectations, this artist/creation dynamic does not dominate the marriage plot of Emma and Mr. Knightley, but instead the friendship plot of Emma and Harriet. In thus translating Pygmalion as a tale of power between two women, Austen invites scrutiny of the intersections of power and the ways it can be abused by privileged women. Moreover, she crafts this tale of domination in the specific context of an imperial Britain that has yet to fully abolish slavery. In Emma’s efforts to shape Harriet’s physical being and destiny, Austen miniaturizes the English project of conquering and “improving” peoples while maintaining them in a state of perpetual inferiority. She thus blends into comedy a critique of imperial ideology as well as undermines the myth of white feminine innocence in imperial endeavors.","['Literature', 'Nineteenth-Century Literature', 'Literature, general', 'Literary Theory']"

However, the high complexity of governing equation, which describes the coupling of heat and mass transfer, makes it challenging to manipulate thermal convection at will in both theory and experiment. Here, we consider the heat transfer in Hele-Shaw cells, a widely-used model of Stokes flow between two parallel plates with a small gap, and apply the scattering-cancellation technology to construct convective thermal materials with bilayer structures and homogeneous isotropic materials. By tailoring thermal conductivity and viscosity, we demonstrate cloaking devices that can simultaneously hide obstacles from heat and fluid motion and verify their robustness under various thermal-convection environments by numerical simulations. Our results show that about 80% of the temperature and pressure disturbances in the background caused by obstacles can be eliminated by the cloak. The developed approach can be extended to control other convection-diffusion systems or multiphysics processes. The results pave a promising path for designing various metadevices such as concentrators or sensors.","['Physics', 'Optics, Lasers, Photonics, Optical Devices', 'Thermodynamics', 'Optical and Electronic Materials', 'Materials Science, general', 'Theoretical, Mathematical and Computational Physics', 'Condensed Matter Physics']"

The purpose of this paper is to present a set of numerical models along with a study methodology to understand the mechanisms most responsible for aging and leakage tightness degradation of prestressed reinforced concrete containment vessels without liner. The solution proposed here is adapted to the study of full-size buildings while most research work dealing with this matter offers sophisticated modeling techniques mostly suitable for local studies. The methodology is applied to study the thermo-hydro-mechanical behavior of Vercors mock-up [ 1 ]. Vercors is an experimental mock-up of a reactor containment building at 1/3 scale (with diameter of 7.7 m, height of 20 m and thickness of 0.4 m) built at EDF Lab “Les Renardières” near Paris in 2015 to analyze the possibility of the life extensions of French Nuclear Power Plants. The mock-up is finely instrumented, and its behavior is monitored from the beginning of the construction. In the numerical application of our modelling methodology to Vercors mock-up, the thermo-hydro-mechanical models are all calibrated by considering first the material test specimen and then the in-situ measurements, to have a representative digital clone of the mock-up. All necessary models and resolution strategy are implemented in Code Aster® (EDF) finite elements program.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Structural Materials', 'Sustainable Development', 'Mathematical Modeling and Industrial Mathematics']"

This paper intends to understand the effect of TiO 2 nanoparticles on Tetraselmis chuii ( T. chuii ) microalgae combustion using a thermogravimetric (TG) analyzer. The kinetic parameters were analyzed using the Coats-Redfern method on the ten models of reaction. The results showed that the combustion of T. chuii occurred in three stages, with the main combustion present at a range of 186.43–589.75 °C. The presence of TiO 2 plays as an accelerator which promoted the decomposition of lipids to the lower temperature and shortened the combustion time. However, the presence of TiO 2 increases the final residue. The adding of TiO 2 reduced the activation energy up to 11.82% (from 72.99 to 64.36 kJ.mol −1 ) in the model of Chemical Reaction Order F1.5.

The gains still fall short of the rate of increase needed to achieve universal access to electricity by 2030, indicating the need to increase the effectiveness of the multi-pronged approach. To do this the paper applies the triple embeddedness framework theory. Within the scope of Eastern Africa, we consider actors in the delivery of electricity access (irrespective of approach or whether public or private) as delivering similar goods and services, and conceptualize them as a collective entity i.e., firms in the electrification industry. The paper then analyses how these firms are shaped by the industry regime and influenced by the socio-political and economic environments, with a view to identifying where and how external pressure can be exerted to stimulate and facilitate the reorientation and recreation required to make progress towards universal electricity access. Through this exercise we demonstrate that the triple embeddedness framework provides a structured way of laying out the key aspects associated with electrification to create a picture that enables one to ‘see the forest for the trees’ and identify where and how to achieve more effective complementarity between on and off-grid approaches, and public and private firms.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Natural Resource and Energy Economics', 'African Politics', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'International Relations']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-19467-2_1,en,A Comprehensive Overview of SDG 14: Life Below Water_Final,OriginalPaper,"An important part of the health of the oceans depends on a good balance of the biogeochemical cycles. Both climate change (in its broadest sense, from the warming of the oceans to acidification) and the introduction of excess nutrients or heavy metals have caused, in many places, distortions in the balances between chemical elements, organisms and detritus. A series of scenarios have been created in which the excess or absence of certain components are distorting carbon fluxes or biomass accumulation. Such changes are not new at all, but now are accelerating and we have to be ready to understand and manage the repercussions that they may have locally and globally. An increase in nitrogen and phosphorus due to land changes in the Amazon, together with other local phenomena, are promoting an uncontrolled increase in Sargassum , which moves every year with the currents until it invades the Caribbean coast, for example. There is such inertia in the entry of these nutrients into the ocean that it becomes difficult to manage them, and even in areas where there is already a much more exhaustive control of the agricultural or industrial activities that promote them, the proliferation of micro and macro algae seems unstoppable. The microbial composition and also the seasonality are key points that have to be considered, especially when certain physical phenomena are weakened such as upwelling (and the related nutrient supply) or the ocean currents (and the related nutrient transport). Several models are based not only on temperature changes (which affect the availability of macro and micronutrients) but also on coastal morphology and local current dynamics. Such models are complex but very useful to understand, locally, what may happen with a cascade effect, such as the relationship of biogeochemical cycles with primary productivity and, in turn, with biomass production. Climate change is greatly affecting this nutrient availability, not only because the physical-chemical balance may be changing, but also because the organisms that process these nutrients are also changing and their ability to recycle may be affected. Acidification also enters this equation, which makes some microelements less available, or makes some species (for example, coccolithophorids) less capable of completing their life cycles, compete for nutrients or suffer more predation because they have more fragile structures. Latitude must also be taken into account in these changes, both due to the effects of climate change and the direct impacts of human activities that have profoundly transformed many ocean environments. In certain areas the predominance of the impact on biogeochemical cycle comes from the direct action of humans (e.g. fertilizers, farming, etc.), but in others the predominance comes from the warming or acidifying effect due to climate change. Thus, for example, the most accelerated changes in the Arctic are having very rapid effects on these biogeochemical cycles, both due to the increase in temperature and acidification and also due to the fact that the dynamics and coverage of the ice are changing. In this area, the direct impacts by pollution and eutrophication are replaced by climate change accelerating paths. Associated with these changes in nutrient cycles is the decrease in available oxygen that alters the physiological capacities of some organisms. The increase in temperature, the decrease in primary production and the slowdown in currents in various parts of the planet are affecting the response capacity of organisms, from benthic to pelagic. No less important is also the fact that stormy phenomena of different types are increasing in frequency and intensity. Storms and hurricanes are also responsible for the distortion of biogeochemical cycles, in some cases impoverishing biomass production and its quality for the following trophic levels. It is a very complex scenario in which the physiology and adaptability of many organisms is at stake, and which we will have to understand in order to properly manage marine resources in the near future.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"

The arrangement of commuter passenger transportation can be improved by regulating the intervals of trains and the passenger capacity of their train sets, which together will ensure their optimal population, minimal unproductive costs for commuter train traction, and more comfortable conditions for passengers. In order to rationally use passenger rolling stock and to improve the convenience and comfort of passengers, it is necessary to constantly conduct research on the capacity of train carriages in commuter trains, depending on seasonality, the level of service, the quality of services provided, as well as the departure interval and the distance of passenger transportation. At the same time, “natural” methods of such studies (which are rather laborious and expensive ones) should be supplemented by their theoretical generalization. The nature of the uneven distribution of passenger flows by periods of the day, directions of transportation has been analyzed and the patterns of fluctuations in passenger flows have been clarified. On this basis, a mathematical model for the formation of commuter train passenger flows has been developed. With its use, the necessary technological parameters for the arrangement of transportation and rolling stock have been established, which was used as a systemic factor in improving the system for organizing commuter passenger transportation based on the Kyiv transport hub.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes']"

The central question is whether an AI should be allowed to own its own copyright. Related to the question of copyright is one of regulation. Currently, there is a vigorous debate on both regulation of algorithms, as well as regulation by algorithms, since the latter may yield more objective outcomes. Critics point, however, to the dehumanizing effects of such regulation, and to the fact that such algorithms may not be objective to begin with, since they have been trained on (potentially biased) human-generated data.

Alkali-activated concrete bricks manufactured using waste by-products are one of the potential alternatives to replace the fired bricks and PC bricks. In this study, 20% replacement of PC with rice husk ash (RHA) was undertaken to evaluate the mechanical performance of blended low calcium fly ash-RHA–based brick (20RHA). The results are compared with PC bricks with similar binder content. The mechanical properties were assessed up to 90 days for both mixes in order to provide a holistic view of the performance of blended fly ash-RHA alkali-activated bricks. Blended fly ash-RHA alkali-activated bricks showed improved mechanical properties in terms of tensile strength and modulus of rupture compared to PC bricks, i.e. early age (7 day) compressive strength, tensile strength and modulus of rupture for all ages up to 90 days. The 20RHA brick showed a compressive strength growth rate of 4% between 7 and 28 days as compared to 13.8% for 100PC bricks. The bonding between blended fly ash-RHA alkali-activated paste and aggregate enhanced the tensile strength properties of the 20RHA bricks. It is concluded that the 20RHA brick is feasible for use as load-bearing bricks in construction industry based on the reported strength properties.","['Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Sustainable Development', 'Building Materials', 'Building Construction and Design']"

Next, the Lyapunov theory is employed to demonstrate the stability of the closed-loop system and derive the adaptation laws for RBF NN.

This airborne turbulence applies unwanted forces and moments to the aircraft and disturbs the movement of the aircraft, interfering with the presumed performance prescribed by the controller. A Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (NDI) control law is especially prone to degradation, proportional to model uncertainties caused by turbulence. To solve this issue, a Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion Controller based on the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is proposed as a disturbance observer. With the help of the Gaussian Process regression, model uncertainties from the turbulence are estimated for the feed-forward term, to aid the performance of the NDI control law. The Dryden model is one of many turbulence models that depict turbulence, in power spectral density form.

(Phys Rev 78(4):046110, 2008 [ 14 ]) and GLFR Le et al. (2017 26th international conference on computer communication and networks (ICCCN). IEEE, pp 1–9, 2017[ 15 ]) models. For performance testing, various structural properties have been analyzed, which are followed by real-world networks. The NMI scores achieved by well-known community detection algorithms were also compared. In experimental analysis, we found that networks generated by our model follow essential properties of real-world networks.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

In this chapter, we argue that blockchains are not about trust per se and that supply chains can and do function effectively – with the mediation of blockchain technologies – without the presupposition of trust. Through the phenomenological lens of Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty and Todes, we posit how blockchains redefine trust in the supply chain context with an exploratory field study. Our analysis suggests that blockchains are better understood as sources of information reliability and accountability that make supply chain transactions possible in a zero-trust environment. Overcoming information asymmetry as a basis for enhanced supply chain functionality through undisrupted parallel flows of products, money and information is what blockchain can significantly contribute towards. If blockchains are – despite commonly held beliefs – not in-and-of-itself about trust, their technology-mediated features can redefine trust in supply chains. The chapter exemplifies the argument by looking at the rise of social commerce in China, which is a good example to illustrate such possibilities.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Supply Chain Management', 'Professional Computing', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Logistics']"

This overrepresentation is consistent across all stages of Hawaiʻi’s criminal justice system (OHA in The Native Hawaiian Justice Task Force Report , 2012). Over the past decade, multiple legislative task force reports have called for a new model that addresses this inequity, through a new justice system that draws from Native Hawaiian cultural values and practices. In line with this call to action, the State of Hawaii Department of Public Safety (DPS) established a partnership with the University of Hawai’i Community Design Center (UHCDC) to explore a planning and design approach to a new culture and place-based corrections model that draws from Hawai’i’s unique geographic, indigenous, and multi-cultural context. This paper describes the development of this approach through teaching, outreach, and research. The chapter also presents outcomes of this effort, a cultural competence framework for corrections that includes goals and tools that support the design of a more equitable system, just processes, and restorative environments.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

Its traditional legal form is the right to self-determination. Nevertheless, limitations identified in western democracies prompted a search for fresh theories, and the latter have given rise to the principle of the right to decide. It is a principle that is linked to democratic decision-making rather than to the resolution of territorial conflicts, though its development may have been seen mainly in relation to these types of issues. As we shall demonstrate, the theory relating to the right to decide has undergone a radical evolution in the Basque Country, as well as receiving contributions from a variety of social movements, often in sectors not strictly concerned with territorial disputes. In this process, the major pro-sovereignty stakeholders, particularly political parties, have doubts about the new direction being taken by the sovereignty movement, and controversy has ensued as to how to approach this concept.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Public Policy']"

In this paper, we have investigated the physics leading to puffing and microexplosion in fuel droplets and identified factors such as droplet detachment modes and droplet-air interaction that influence puffing/microexplosion. A microsyringe is used to inject droplets as small as 100 μm radius in a control volume chamber maintained at 500 ℃ and atmospheric pressure. Droplet dynamics are captured using high-speed camera coupled with a long-distance microscopic lens using backlight illumination technique as the droplet traverses and undergoes puffing and microexplosion. In-house image processing codes are used to track droplet motion and compute its geometrical parameters, which enable us to decipher microexplosion dynamics. During this study, two significant factors were identified to cause puffing/microexplosion; thinning of droplet shell and interfacial instabilities. A general trend of increasing puffing times was observed with increasing droplet radii. The modes of detachment do affect the instabilities at the droplet surface which further amplify them and causes early puffing. Furthermore, the rate of bubble growth was amplified for the droplets traversing at higher Reynolds number.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks', 'Energy Storage']"

We find that if we control the steepness and alignment power factor, we can create multiform morphogenesis. It is not a top-down scheme, but a purely self-organization behavior. In the proposed system, after tried to compare and analyze different settings for our model, we can get a stable multiform morphogenesis without collision.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Multiagent Systems', 'Systems Theory, Control']"

NIRS provides an assessment of the adequacy of oxygen supply relative to demand in vascular beds, and is the technology used in cerebral oximetry. NIRS has been widely adopted as a monitor of the adequacy of brain tissue oxygenation in anesthesiology and critical care medicine and is also used intraoperatively to monitor the perfusion of the spinal cord and some other somatic vascular beds. Measurements of rScO 2 are affected by patient factors, disease states, physiologic alterations, and the variable technology and algorithms incorporated in the design of commercial monitors. It is essential that clinicians understand the technology that underlies NIRS-based cerebral oximetry so that monitoring data can be interpreted correctly. Cerebral oximetry is influenced by a variety of physiologic inputs that can alert clinicians to dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) and other vital organs. Specifically, cerebral NIRS monitoring integrates the cumulative input of (a) cardiac output, (b) arterial blood pressure, (c) arterial oxygen content, (d) pH and partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ), (e) patency of the CNS vasculature, (f) cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO 2 ), (g) intracranial pressure (ICP), and (h) cerebral autoregulation. Cerebral oximetry is widely used in neonatology, vascular surgery, cardiac surgery, neurologic critical care, and pediatric and adult anesthesia practice. In this chapter, we review (a) the current state of NIRS monitoring technology and its limitations, (b) the physiologic variables that alter tissue oxygen balance, (c) the rationale for the use of cerebral oximetry in critical care medicine and anesthesia practice, (d) the evidence that supports its use in specific patient populations and surgical procedures, and (e) future directions for the development of NIRS technology and clinical applications .","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Anesthesiology', 'Neurosurgery', 'Pain Medicine']"

Terrain-following is an essential technique for military aircraft and should be carried out in a safe flight while maintaining the lowest altitude as possible. In terrain-following, it is important for aircraft to stay above the reference trajectory and fly well despite the presence of disturbances such as wind. In this work, we propose a model predictive control method that performs real-time optimization for terrain-following guidance. MPC reflects the model of the aircraft and several maneuver constraints, so optimal planning for terrain-following can be designed. The nonlinear kinematic model of the aircraft is defined, and successive convexification is performed to linearize the nonlinear model and successfully solve the optimization problem. The proposed algorithm was compared with the general guidance algorithm, in this work we compared it with the L1 navigation law. As a result of real-time simulations, the MPC guidance algorithm performed terrain-following with a safer and smaller error, even with the presence of disturbances.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

They are used in various applications, e.g., for handling fragile objects, navigating sensitive/complex environments, etc., and are typically actuated by Pneumatic/hydraulic loads. Though demands for soft robots are continuously increasing in various engineering sectors, due to the lack of systematic approaches, they are primarily designed manually. This paper presents a systematic density-based topology optimization approach to designing soft robots while considering the design-dependent behavior of the actuating loads. We use the Darcy law with the conceptualized drainage term to model the design-dependent nature of the applied pressure loads. The standard finite element is employed to evaluate the consistent nodal loads from the obtained pressure field. The robust topology optimization formulation is used with the multi-criteria objective. The success of the presented approach is demonstrated by designing a member/soft robot of the pneumatic networks (PneuNets). The optimized member is combined in several series to get different PneuNets. Their CAD models are generated, and they are studied with high-pressure loads in a commercial software. Depending upon the number of members in the PneuNets, different output motions are noted.","['Engineering', 'Nanotechnology and Microengineering', 'Mechatronics', 'Machinery and Machine Elements']"

The need to model robot control systems in their design is justified. An approach to describing the operation of a robot control system based on a classical differential equation system capable of generating requirements for a robot control system is presented. It is shown that this approach allows to describe the process of operation of the robot control system only in stationary mode, without taking into account workload intensity and time delays in different modes of operation of the robot control system. In order to compensate for the detected shortcomings, it is proposed to describe the operation of the robot control system in the form of a non-Markov process based on the principle of balance of “complex probabilities.“ This replaces the time characteristics with their images in the Laplace transform. Solving the system of state balance equations enables to obtain probabilistic characteristics of transient processes of robot control system operation in time domain. A calculated example is presented where transitions between states of operation of the robot control system are subject to normal distribution law.","['Engineering', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation', 'Electrical Engineering']"

Driving anger is related to anger as a trait, but is not prominently expressed in all subjects with high trait anger, and can occur in those who have lower trait anger scores, so it is somewhat specific to the traffic situation. Drivers with higher anger in traffic situation are more aggressive in their driving behavior, with increased risk for crash and injury for themselves and others. A variety of instruments, with somewhat different purposes, has been developed to measure and examine the emotional and behavioral profiles of angry drivers. Some intervention methods to reduce/prevent risk-taking behavior in traffic have aimed at anger-related constructs.

One approach is to analyze human cognitive abilities to isolate functions that have particular use in some processing domains (like language), with potential re-use in other domains. Here we focus on symmetry perception and production as may be realized in the function, expect a copy or a specialization of that function, expect a complemented copy . We illustrate the benefits of assuming such an operator is available to language processing by demonstrating that it allows reconciling empirical facts of human language processing with the natural predictions of formal language theory. The other approach is in simulation systems, parameterized to afford exploration of the effects of assuming that posited operators behave in particular ways. We link this to the expect a copy function through this being fundamental to habituation, which is requisite in simulation systems that model evolving behaviours and social constructs, like natural language.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Employing a critical post-humanist lens could expose decisions such as ending the Western military intervention in Afghanistan as acts of necropolitics, Mbembe’s term denoting policies that decide over life and death (Mbembe, 2019). A post-humanist analysis could be used to highlight the fragility of supposedly inalienable human rights.

Control of flow means a slight shift in flow structure by means of active or passive methods that serve a preferably significant aerodynamic advantage. The aim of this study is to predict flow behavior over an airfoil under the effect of a plasma actuator; an extensive numerical investigation on a symmetric airfoil with a plasma actuator’s effect over it has been conducted using Ansys Fluent tool. Experimental data from NASA turbulent flow for NACA0012 is used as a benchmark and validated using the Spalart–Allmaras RANS model. User Defined Functions (UDF) with plasma source term are defined in C language which numerically simulates the Lorentz force over the airfoil which in turn is due to the effect of plasma actuators. Aerodynamic coefficients like Drag, Lift coefficients, and flow field are compared and the effect on the Lift/Drag ratio is evaluated in the presence of the plasma actuator’s effect. This is indicated by the change in drag coefficient which is reduced by 13% and the lift coefficient increased by 1.2%. To evaluate the acoustics of the airfoil, Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings (Fw-H) integral method is used, Sound Pressure Level (SPL) is compared in Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) with frequency domain, and the SPL is used to compare the effect of plasma actuator on acoustics. The average reduction in SPL is around 3% due to plasma actuators for Angle of Attack of 5°–15°, Maximum reduction of 5% for the angle of attack of 15° for plasma actuators located at 0.2 of the chord.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer']"

The integration of sustainable investment criteria in sovereign wealth funds is therefore crucial for the financial market’s contribution to securing the functioning of Earth systems and thereby a safe operating space for humanity. Such an integration requires an interdisciplinary approach with contributions from both natural science and finance. The main objective of this qualitative desk study is to analyse the profiles of the four sovereign wealth funds in Europe with the aim of illuminating their different commitments to sustainable investments, both in policy and in practice. More specifically, we discuss these funds’ contributions to global society staying within planetary boundaries. We use the concept of sustainable and responsible investment (SRI) to classify the funds into different generations of SRI funds, with a focus on the environmental sustainability part of SRI. The results show that three of these four institutional investors in Europe are integrating SRI considerations into their investment strategies and two of these sovereign wealth funds can be characterized as belonging to advanced generations of SRI funds. Climate change is the planetary boundary which is most integrated into the investment strategies, but there is still limited information about the effect of these strategies.","['Business and Management', 'Sustainability Management', 'Economic Geography', 'Diversity Management/Women in Business', 'Law and Economics', 'Business Ethics']"

The paper also gives an appraisal of the AU’s response to the pandemic including its vaccination strategy and argues that in the face of an unprecedented pandemic, the AU ought to be commended for adopting a swift and proactive approach; commensurate with the anticipated scale of the problem. The paper concludes that the pandemic has laid bare the socio-economic problems faced by African problems, the very same problems which the AU sought to address through Agenda 2063.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'African Politics']"

The structure integrates a widely used flight maneuver and preview control systems using light detection and ranging. A set of state-space models derived at different flight Mach numbers is used to design the controller. In this study, the controller structure is selected as a linear function of the Mach number, i.e., the control gains are linearly interpolated with the current Mach number. We compare the GS and gain-fixed (GF) controller results at various airspeeds. The simulation result shows that utilizing the preview information improves the gust alleviation performance in GS and GF controls. In addition, the GS controller performs better than the GF controller in tracking the vertical acceleration command as the Mach number reduces.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

The equations system of gas dynamics for polytropic gas considering the force of gravity with the polytropic index γ = 7.02 is used as a mathematical model. It is assumed that this model adequately describes two-dimensional water flows. With the help of non-stationary self-similar variables, the analytical solution to the problem is constructed in the area of rarefaction wave from the boundary of the resting gas to the gas-vacuum boundary in the form of convergent series. The first terms of the convergent series are used as the approximate conditions for the numerical statement of the problem, and the introduced error is estimated. Then the numerical modeling of the rarefaction wave is performed with the help of the explicit difference scheme.","['Mathematics', 'Numerical Analysis', 'Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis']"

Since there exists physical water extraction variation over these aquifers, three aflaj type normally classified known as daudi, ghaili (oasis) and ayni (spring). This paper used a sample of these three types to capture the physical-extraction variation in the aim to examine and document the historical methodology undertaken to develop different institutional arrangements. Although there exist three water-extraction processes in Oman, the finding clearly classified the three aflaj types with respect to institution for maintenance into two main categories. The first category considered more complex and hold several sophisticated components or its main water source were constructed near oasis which cause severe damage from the occasional heavy rain flood. Because of this, forced the local to develop institution based on water market. The second category was identified of being simple and was constructed away from flooded areas. This thought to require less financial support for maintenance. Hence, the survey provided evidence by which places daudi and ghaili within the first category and ayni system in the other.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Water, general', 'Pollution, general']"

The unknown acceleration whose frequency is within the bandwidth of the ESO can be accurately estimated online, however, the estimation effect outside the bandwidth is not optimistic. Therefore, the proposed technique is to predict the acceleration at high frequency by the LSTM network based on the accurate estimated data when the bandwidth is constrained by the guidance system. Theoretically, the error range predicted by the network should be smaller than estimated only by a low bandwidth ESO. Moreover, unifying the ESO and the LSTM can simultaneously ensure the accurate acquisition of unknown acceleration at low and high frequency in the case of bandwidth constraints. The simulation results verify the superiority of the approach.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Multiagent Systems', 'Systems Theory, Control']"

Aradau, Post-anarchism and Whore-Walks",OriginalPaper,"This chapter analyses the approach to and advocacy around both sex work and trafficking in women for sexual exploitation of transnational sex worker organisations that operate at EU level, in particular, of TAMPEP and the ICRSE, in order to assess their desecuritising potential. Drawing on social movement theory and EU Gender Studies, I outline the specific obstacles that the collective mobilisation of sex workers confronts at EU level, including those posed by the EU’s own civil society interface. In turn, engaging critically with the unique approach to unmaking security proposed by Claudia Aradau, I argue, first, that while she is right in stating that the principles of universality and equality can be reclaimed from within liberal political institutions, and not just against them, she is wrong in identifying such principles in the notion of work , and thus sex work as having the potential to desecuritise trafficking in women for sexual exploitation at EU level. Secondly, I argue that Aradau adheres to what Chris Rossdale calls a hegemonic ontology of agency , which makes her disavow the desecuritising potential of the advocacy that sex worker organisations engage in at a distance from the state. Drawing on post-anarchism theories, I conclude, that it is in the prefigurative forms of direct action and anarchistic forms of subjective resistance that sex workers enact, in the public demonstrations they develop as whore-walks , in particular, that their true desecuritising potential lies.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Politics and Gender', 'European Politics', 'International Security Studies']"

The executive branch, already structurally concentrating in its hand’s substantial power via the Doctrine of Necessity, imposed because of the country’s ongoing ethnic conflict and division and the country’s presidential system, was strengthened further as it was effectively ruling by decrees without sufficient parliamentary scrutiny. Opposition parties kept a low profile and avoided to openly confront the government on the core issues, restricting criticism to peripheral matters and questioning the form of measures rather than the policy substance. At the same time, social dialogue was not suspended, and trade unions and employers were invited by the government to submit their views on aspects of the situation relevant to the economy and the labour market. Overall, no major change in policy direction has been evident so far and conservative rhetoric is widespread among government officials. To convey the government response and its surrounding social, economic and political environment, this chapter articulates how authoritarianism finds its specified, local expression and manifests itself into social disempowerment.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Comparative Politics']"

The overall performance of the valve can be affected by a numbers of factors, and the effect of roughness is still not fully understood. Using computational fluid dynamics technology, the influence of roughness on the throttle characteristics of the spool of a series multi-stage pressure-reducing regulating valve is studied. Under the same inlet velocity condition, numerical simulation of different roughness is carried out, and its influence on the internal flow of the series multi-stage pressure reducing valve is analyzed. The findings depict that the maximum pressure difference in the valve and the friction pressure difference increase with the increase of the roughness and after 2 mm, the increase decreases with the increase of the relative roughness, and finally gradually stabilizes; the average velocity at the valve outlet and the average internal velocity decrease progressively with the increase of roughness, and the relationship is approximately linear; at the roughness of 1 mm, the maximum wall shear stress is 5.6 times that when the roughness is 0 mm. In addition, the flow resistance coefficient increases linearly with the increase of roughness. The research results can provide theoretical support for the structural design of the series multi-stage pressure reducing valve.","['Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Energy Storage']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-030-98798-5_13,en,The Moral Dimension of Countermovements: The Case of Anti-Feminism,OriginalPaper,"The aim of the chapter is to develop an analytical framework for studying the moral dimension of countermovements, which despite obvious significance for movement mobilization is rarely considered in countermovement theory. We argue that Axel Honneth’s theory of recognition can be used to develop an analytical framework that allows for grasping not only the moral dimension of struggles between social movements and countermovements but also moral divisions within countermovements. According to Honneth, social struggles stem from perceived misrecognition in relation to a set of moral meta-values that form the basis of legitimate claims in Western society: love, equality, and achievement. These meta-values can be understood differently in concrete areas of political struggle, and activists from different camps tend to make quite different interpretations. With this approach, it is possible to analyze countermovements’ moral claims in relation to social movements’ societal values and norms, and whether and how different strands within a countermovement make different types of moral claims. We demonstrate the usefulness of the analytical framework by applying it to the division between feminism and anti-feminism and the division between varieties of anti-feminism (the Christian Right movement, the mythopoetic men’s movement, the men’s rights movement, and the manosphere). What emerges is a picture of the interrelationship between feminism and anti-feminism that is more complex than the common designation of progressive versus reactionary movements. It is clear that the different strands of anti-feminism relate morally in partly different ways to feminism. They all react against what is understood as misrecognition of men as a result of feminism, but the types of moral claims and their specific emphasis on them vary.","['Social Sciences', 'Political Sociology', 'Moral Philosophy', 'Ethics', 'Political Theory']"

CLT is an engineered wood product composed of dimensional lumber adhered in orthogonal layers. During service, CLT products are susceptible to moisture cycles which can lead to short-term performance and long-term durability issues. Numerical software packages such as WUFI are traditionally used to investigate the hygrothermal performance of CLT materials; however, these programs do not consider the impact of adhesive layers on air and moisture transfer. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a novel 1D heat, air and moisture (HAM) numerical modelling tool that considers the impact of the adhesive layers on the moisture and air transfer in CLT. This paper establishes a novel methodology for the hygrothermal analysis of CLT products which includes the impact of adhesive layers. The methodology and model are validated using existing WUFI software and the simulation of CLT without adhesive layers. The results of the analysis show that the adhesive layers slow the rate of moisture transfer within the wood layers bounded by adhesives. Future research includes a study and analysis of the hygrothermal impact of adhesive layers in CLT in specific climate conditions as well as further validation of the model using laboratory and field testing.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

Disasters with tremendous impacts disrupt the administration of state and hinder the development processes, mainly because the events require expensive and long recovery process. The issuance of Law No. 24 of 2007 on Disaster Management has triggered a paradigm change in disaster management in Indonesia. The management of disaster which previously tended to be responsive and spontaneous has shifted toward preventive and more focused on disaster preparedness and risk reduction. This law explicitly states the responsibility of the government in the implementation of Disaster Management in the form of disaster risk reduction and it integration to development programs. In addition, in the implementation of Disaster Management the government has the authority in determining disaster management policies in line with national development policies. But it is undeniable that there were many cases where different approaches between government and community emerged and become sensitive issues in dealing with disasters management particularly in disaster risk reduction. In this paper a series of intensive community involvement in the form of focus group discussions has been proposed and should be carried out by government in the preparation of development plans. This includes early round of activities followed by formal round of consultation before a draft document of development plans is prepared. Accommodating local wisdom through this robust community engagement is essential in the governmental strategy preparation process.

The main one is the absence or incorrect answer to the question “For whom exactly should AI be explained?”. Turning to human psychology and social processes that are accompanied by the exchange of explanations, we will try to consider what benefits the explanation brings to people and groups. Correcting fundamental errors in the construction of XAI concepts, we show that neural networks are no less explanatory AI than linear models and decision trees.

As community identification task involves identifying important people and their linkages, social network analysis is one such technique to analyse complex networks such as criminal networks. Keeping in view the diversity of actors and gangs involved in crime activities, the goal is to investigate and assess their characteristics so that the essential information characterising their behaviour is extracted. The current work will employ a social network analysis-based novel approach called sentiment analysis on influential nodes (SAOIN) to attain this important goal. Our approach claims to be computationally efficient as only the influential nodes (aka leaders) of the established subnetworks (communities) are taken into consideration for further investigation rather than inquiring each and every actor of a network. This discerns our model from other already existing community identifying techniques. The proposed model generates small subnetworks that can be used to discover the list of actors and their relationships that need to be inquired further, As opposed to other already existing community detecting methods that generates larger and much complex networks. This study inquires actors of the social network like Twitter whose activities promotes criminal propaganda across diverse stages. The information dissemination among these actors directs sole insight towards their behaviours.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']"

The TAII Framework takes a holistic approach to identifying the systemic relationships of ethics for the company ecosystem and considers corporate values, business models, and common good aspects like the Sustainable Development Goals and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The TAII Framework creates guidance to initiate the implementation of AI ethics in organizations without requiring a deep background in philosophy and considers the social impacts outside of a software and data engineering setting. Depending on the legal regulation or area of application, the TAII Framework can be adapted and used with different regulations and ethical principles.","['Business and Management', 'IT in Business', 'Business Ethics', 'Engineering Ethics', 'Organization', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

An additional cutting force component that arises due to interference of the vibrating tool with the cut surface is thought to be responsible for this damping. Experimentally identifying and isolating the mechanisms causing process damping is difficult due to its complex relationship with tool wear. This paper hence proposes the use of a hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) simulator to investigate and emulate the stability of turning with process damping. The HiL simulator has a hardware layer consisting of a flexure representing a flexible workpiece and an actuator that emulates the virtual cutting forces computed in the software layer. Controlled experiments on the HiL simulator agree with model predictions and confirm an increase in the chatter vibration-free cutting performance at low speeds in the presence of process damping. These results can instruct investigating other nonlinearities co-occurring with process damping to develop solutions to mitigate them.,"['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Robotics and Automation']"

Such “dark matter radios” are particularly useful tools to search the broad range of UBDM wavelengths where resonant cavity dimensions are too large to be practical. In this chapter, we discuss how dark matter radios can be used to search for UBDM, focusing on the case of hidden photons.","['Physics', 'Particle and Nuclear Physics', 'Astrophysics and Astroparticles', 'Cosmology']"

Despite financial resources used in R &D have increased over time the number of drugs developed has remained almost constant. The phenomenon is known as “Eroom’s Law”. In order to start growing R &D efficiency again, the business models of companies were reviewed by mainly implementing open innovation models that can simplify and shorten the drug development process. Pharmaceutical companies are increasingly outsourcing activities from the external environment. The R &D tasks that firms choose to outsource include a wide spectrum of activities from basic research to late-stage development: genetic engineering, target validation, assay development, hit exploration and lead optimization (hit candidates-as-a-service), safety and efficacy tests in animal models, and clinical trials involving humans. Terms such as crowdsourcing, innovation centers, R &D collaboration, and open source are becoming more and more common in the sector. Almost all the Big Pharma are striving to create collaborative networks that might allow them to be more efficient. Pharmaceutical companies are called upon to make a “make or buy” decision to determine whether it is more convenient to outsource these activities rather than exploiting internal resources for generating innovation. In a global context in which the stochastic view has become more suitable for interpreting phenomena the aim of this kind of decision is mainly related to decrease uncertainty. The aim of the chapter is to explore this topic by also providing data and examples.","['Economics', 'Health Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences/Technology', 'Economics, general', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Biotechnology', 'Economic Theory/Quantitative Economics/Mathematical Methods']"

Due to constant used at various temperature, pressure, and conditions, components are susceptible to various of failures including thermal fatigue, corrosion, and others. Due to cyclic temperature, multiple cracks have been observed on the closed blowdown system (CBS) header piping in a short period. The crack was observed on the welding join between two different thickness pipes. This paper aims to study the structural integrity and risk level of the CBS line with the presence of different thickness intersection. Finite element analysis (FEA) was conducted on this line to evaluate the overall material behaviour and assessed the risk of failure. The acceptance criteria of the analysis were set to be based on ASME VIII-Division 2 part 5.2.2 (elastic stress analysis method) and ASME II-part D. Findings from FEA show that the failure occurred on the CBS line was caused by the presence of the different thickness intersection. Changes in geometry at this intersection causing stress intensification and high-peak stress that is highly susceptible to crack initiation in cyclic service. It is recommended that the petroleum refinery plant to sectionally replace the closed blowdown system line to ensure the pipe wall thickness is uniform throughout the entire length, thus eliminating stress intensification point and subsequently, removing the potential of fatigue failure.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Structural Materials', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films', 'Machinery and Machine Elements']"

Here we outline the application of metabolomics to understanding risk, treatment, and prognosis of GDM, and where possible the utility of metabolomics in understanding subtypes of GDM. Studies of metabolomics using blood collected during pregnancy indicate that GDM risk and treatment is associated with altered levels of amino acids, long-chain fatty acids, and glycolytic intermediates. Further, use of multiple metabolites in conjunction with clinical factors has a better value over clinical factors alone or a single metabolite, for predicting risk of T2D among women who had GDM.

As far as Armenia is concerned, it resulted in the dismantling of state institutions, the rise of the Karabakh clan as the dominating force in Armenian politics, and compromised independence with Russia to keep the Karabakh region occupied.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-16155-1_1,en,"Permaculture Principles, Practices, and Environmentalism",OriginalPaper,"Permaculture emerged in the late 1970s as an alternative-agriculture movement in Australia. Permaculture is a practical philosophy of how to work with nature rather than against it. The underlying ethical principles of permaculture, which are Earth care, people care and fair share, recognise the interdependence between agriculture and the rest of the world and between humans and non-humans. Permaculture is not just about growing food in a sustainable manner. Permaculture is a system integrating the diverse functions of otherwise separate elements of the human settlements including nutrients, species, farms, villages, industries, and sectors. This chapter explores permacultural practices with real-world examples. Permaculture ethics can be practiced at varying spatial scales. At the farming household level, polyculture, crop rotations, and crop-livestock integration can be implemented to maintain soil fertility in a closed nutrient cycle. At the household level, low-impact and energy-efficient housing is carried out. At the community level, permaculture has been the philosophical and design foundation of co-housing or ecovillage movements. At the business level, permaculture offers the business ethics of no waste of resources and corporate social responsibility. Permaculture philosophy can be a guideline underlying a bioregional planning, which denies human dominance over nature. This chapter also brings attention to the problem associated with the dichotomous division of ecocentrism and technocentrism. As represented in the Earth care ethical principle, permaculture is concerned for global resource scarcities and environmental pollution. Thus, permaculture is often understood to take the highly ecocentric environmental view. On the other hand, permaculture advocates for technological development that enables the use of renewable energy sources. Thus, it is inappropriate to place permaculture environmentalism on a linear spectrum of environmentalism where ecocentrism and technocentrism are polarised. ","['Life Sciences', 'Agriculture', 'Science, multidisciplinary', 'Pollution, general', 'Biotechnology']"

With fewer financial resources to offset college costs, students and their families have taken on a tide of debt to finance undergraduate degrees. As the student loan debt in the United States has topped $1.7 trillion, the sheer enormity of this debt reflects an education system complicit in the processes eroding the benefits of a college degree. Degree-seekers most reliant on a college degree to advance their social and economic positions ironically receive little training to develop the financial knowledge, tools, and resources necessary to navigate the financial challenges of higher education. Rooted in democratic idealism, colleges and universities are responsible for making college affordability and economic success more attainable for a diverse student body. This chapter shifts the scholarly analysis from whether colleges should provide opportunities for navigating financing higher education to a question about how they can engage in the processes that develop students’ financial savviness with an intersectional lens. Evidence from a financial literacy undergraduate course elucidates the possibilities of a multifaceted approach to financial education aimed at a diverse student body. Recommendations in this chapter disrupt race-neutral, deficit-based, and universal paradigms evident in existing financial education programs and provide curricular support that is more sensitive to today’s degree-seekers’ needs.","['Education', 'Higher Education', 'Education, general', 'Ethnicity, Class, Gender and Crime', 'Sociology of Education']"

This misconception hampers participants from understanding the security differences between public and private blockchains and adopting blockchain technology in suitable contexts. This chapter introduces the notion of “people security” to argue that blockchains hold inherent limitations in offering accurate security guarantees to people as participants in blockchain-based infrastructure, due to the differing nature of the threats to participants reliant on blockchain as secure digital infrastructure, as well as the technical limitations between different types of blockchain architecture. This chapter applies a sociotechnical security framework to assess the social, software, and infrastructural layers of blockchain applications to reconceptualize “blockchain security” as “people security.” A sociotechnical security analysis of existing macrosocial-level blockchain systems surfaces discrepancies between the social, technical, and infrastructural layers of a blockchain network, the technical and governance decisions that characterize the network, and the expectations of, and threats to, participants using the network. The results identify a number of security and trust assumptions against various blockchain architectures, participants, and applications. Findings indicate that private blockchains have serious limitations for securing the interests of users in macrosocial contexts due to their centralized nature. In contrast, public blockchains reveal trust and security shortcomings at the micro- and meso-organizational levels, yet there is a lack of suitable desktop case studies by which to analyze sociotechnical security at the macrosocial level. The theoretical basis of this piece provides a foundation for blockchain security promises to be further investigated in practice and addressed in order for blockchain security to more accurately provide “people security” for those that use it.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security']"

Despite this hypothesis, the achievement of the equations for the case of sloping wall and backfill is relatively difficult. However, when using the principles of granular mechanics, this problem is simplified to an elementary exercise in Statics. The definition of the associated and conjugate bands allows finding the global contact forces in any rhombic element of an infinite slope, under the condition that it obeys the Mohr-Coulomb law of plasticity. Knowing the contact area between a band and the back side of the retaining wall, the lateral pressure of the backfill is obtained, which is found to increase linearly with depth and depends on sines and cosines of the inclination angles of the back face, the slope of the backfill, and the angle of the associated bands. The lateral force is attained by integrating the pressure along the back face of the retaining wall, and can be verified with those resultants obtained previously by using the theory of plasticity. Granular mechanics allows for the complete generalization of the Rankine’s theory by means of very simple calculations.","['Engineering', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Offshore Engineering']"

We present a canonical case in which there is no overlap between instruments and persons: each person is measured by a unique instrument. We then show what is required to estimate measures in this degenerate case. The canonical case encourages a simplification and reconceptualization of validity and reliability Reliability . Not surprisingly, this reconceptualization looks a lot like the way physicists and chemometricians think about validity and measurement error.

Because molecular simulations can only be carried out for small system sizes, correction for finite sizes may be required for making direct comparison between calculated results and experimental data. We first summarize the three methods and then present detailed implementation of each method on a Lennard-Jones fluid. In the first method, chemical potentials are calculated over a range of particle densities in canonical-ensemble simulations; the densities of the dilute and dense phases at the given temperature are then found by a Maxwell equal-area construction. In Gibbs-ensemble Monte Carlo, the exchange between separated dilute and dense phases is simulated to obtain their densities. Lastly, slab-geometry molecular dynamics simulations model the dilute and dense phases in coexistence and yield not only their densities but also their interfacial tension. The three types of simulations are carried out for a range of system sizes, and the results are scaled to generate the binodals corrected for finite system sizes. Size-corrected interfacial tension is also produced from slab-geometry molecular dynamics simulations.","['Life Sciences', 'Biochemistry, general', 'Bioinformatics']"

In 9.1, based almost entirely on the work of Gábor Recski and his co-workers at TU Wien, we outline a system that probes for matches with a far more complex conceptual model, that of building codes and regulations in effect in the city of Vienna.","['Computer Science', 'Natural Language Processing (NLP)', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Knowledge based Systems', 'Digital Humanities']"

The focus is no longer only on income inequality but on the analysis of the reasonable and unreasonable factors of income inequality from the dual perspectives of inequality of opportunity and inequality of effort. The way to alleviate inequality is to change uncontrollable external factors (e.g., the system and environment) and create equal opportunities. The proportion of wealth inequality in income inequality is on the rise, which is the primary manifestation of the widening gap between the rich and the poor, also deepening inequality to a certain extent. The change in inequality is inseparable from the role of the system. The system is not only the source of inequality but also the way to solve it.","['Business and Management', 'Business Strategy/Leadership', 'Management', 'Economic Growth', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Asian Economics', 'International Organization']"

After briefly reviewing the history of awareness of climate change and the historical movements that have emerged and raised attention to the necessity of climate action (e.g., Club of Rome), the chapter follows with a more recent overview of the various societal dynamics that underpin the inertia towards climate action. Climate inertia can be understood as another form of absurdity whereby the current status quo is normalized (e.g., that governments and companies are doing enough to address climate change; that climate action should not interfere with economic rationale). By discussing climate inertia as hypernormalized absurdity, new insights are generated into the perpetuation of the status quo. Moreover, new ways out of the hypernormalized situation can be constructed through the process of problematization, resistance, imagining, and transformation.","['Business and Management', 'Management', 'Organization']"

This paper wants to incorporate memory effects that are based on the fact that economic agents remember the history of changes in exogenous and endogenous variables. Memory or past experiences have a great impact on the real inventory system to maintain the business. The inclusion of the memory effect in the inventory system has been done by using fractional calculus. We have also established the existence of salvage value in the memory-dependent inventory system in absence of deteriorating items. Finally, sensitivity analysis is done to determine the most important parameters of the system for the market studies so that it would be taken care seriously. Our considered numerical example is able to crack the practical situation. In practice, if the rate of change of the initial demand is more compared to the initial demand that means the selling rate is increasing for the businessman’s good business policy or good product quality. By considering the rate of change of initial demand > initial demand, profit is more compared to the opposite case. From the numerical example, it is clear that business policy was not good for that inventory system.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Statistics, general', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It was from 2012 onwards that China Merchants and a host of other Chinese SOEs began making their presence felt in Djibouti. 2012 also goes down as the year when the regime’s relationship with Dubai Ports World (DPW) would pass the point of no return.

We draw upon a unique dataset of technocratic ministers that includes variables on the technocrats’ demographic characteristics, education, professional experience, and participation in civil society organizations. Latent class analysis is applied to establish a typology of the technocratic ministers. Our analysis illustrates that the number of technocrats increases in Greek cabinets during crises and that technocratic ministers come mainly from the wider public sector and much less from the market and civil society. We distinguish two types of technocratic ministers: the “movers,” who build their expertise in various positions in the public sector, private companies, and international organizations, and the “institutionally established” technocrats, who build their expertise through long-standing investment in a particular institution. Because movers are preferred by PMs as technocratic ministers, we argue that the capacity to operationalize expertise in different policy-related domains is a valuable resource for a technocrat to be appointed in a governmental position.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Political Sociology', 'Political Communication', 'Political Leadership']"

Using different cooling media during the in-process cooling of Friction Stir Welding leads to different cooling rates being induced in the tool-work piece interface. This in turn results in considerable changes across the temperature distribution along the weld line. In the present study, in-process cooling during the friction stir welding of Aluminium Alloy 2014 (AA2014) is performed using a nozzle designed to produce a spray with water and compressed air. K-type thermocouples coupled with Arduino UNO are placed on both Advancing Side (AS) and Retreating Side (RS) of the weld in order to measure the temperature distribution along the weld line. It is found that when a spray with water being maintained at a flow rate of 60 ml/min and the air at a pressure of 3 bar is used during welding, the peak temperature in the weld decreases which can attributed to the combined cooling effect caused by water and compressed air. The different phases of Friction stir welding along with cooling are simulated using a Finite Element Model (FEM) that has been developed in ABAQUS/CAE module using Coulomb’s law of Friction formulation and Johnson–Cook constitutive and damage evolution model. An Explicit analysis with various mechanical and thermal boundary conditions has been performed for simulating the actual welding process. The experimental results obtained are then validated using the simulated results.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes']"

Nowadays, numerous agricultural technology providers are entering the market, focusing on aggregating farmers’ data. But many farmers, especially smallholders, do not benefit from the sharing and exchange of this data, which leaves them feeling disempowered. Until today, ethical considerations were often side-lined because gathering more data was seen as necessary, and concerns about how data might be abused or misused were only subsequently considered. However, with the increase of big data in smart farming, it is more essential than ever to focus on the ethical aspects of data governance (access, control, consent) and practices. Therefore, these ethical questions will provide valuable insights into how data is being collected and used, for what purposes, how to bridge the digital divide, and how to create transparency and build trust between stakeholders. This chapter will focus on farmers’ perspectives and how they could actively participate in a more equitable data sharing and exchange in the agri-food value chain by contributing to the design of a fairer data governance framework. The adoption of agricultural codes of conduct is the example that will be explored.","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy of Science', 'Plant Sciences', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The chapter argues that there are two quite different readings of the democratic implications of the fake news, disinformation, and manipulation challenge: on the one hand, as the rise of a certain type of political actor that claims that established politicians and their conduct of politics have lost touch with ordinary people and their concerns, and in addition, actively seeks to undermine confidence in science and scientists. Thus, the factual and evidence-based foundation of democratic politics is challenged by the rise of a particular species of populist politician and populist parties marked by a distinct style, and relatively unencumbered by conventional party politics. If these phenomena can be identified with and confined to a specific set of actors, parties, and their supporters, then the political challenge is how best to contain or isolate them. The other reading approaches the democratic challenge from a more structural angle and searches for the roots of anti-political sentiment and the trust gap in the circumstances surrounding policymaking and politics. The two readings suggest different causal dynamics in terms of how fake news, disinformation, and manipulation affect democracy. If structural changes are important sources of fake news, disinformation, and manipulation, then the rise of populism is hardly the only source of fake news and disinformation. If so, the irony in focusing on the most blatant manifestations of fake news as espoused by populist politicians is that it may detract attention from those factors that helped create such traits in the first place.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Political Sociology', 'Political Communication']"

As the ground warms, the permafrost soil thaws and turns from continuous to discontinuous or sporadic, which induces various kinds oef impacts and risks to the globe. One major problem that the thawing permafrost brings is the differential settlement, which is primarily related to the damage of the human infrastructures in the permafrost area. Northwest Territories (NWT) is a typical region in Canada that is mostly covered by permafrost. Yellowknife is one of the most populated areas, where the permafrost is extensively discontinuously distributed. Ingraham Trail in NWT serves as major access to Yellowknife. This paper investigates the permafrost degradation impacts along Ingraham Trail by focusing on the vertical settlement of the pavement structure. A numerical model was generated to investigate such impacts during freeze–thaw cycles. The varied settlements were simulated for the same season from 2013 to 2020. In addition, with anticipated impacts of climate change and water table change caused by global warming, the increasing thaw settlements for November from 2020 to 2050 were projected. The settlements with the potential permafrost protection (i.e., insulation materials) were also analyzed using the model, corroborating its primary function with significantly decreased frost heaves in pavements.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

The current chapter aims to explore whether changes in party’s MPs’ profiles and trajectories can be interpreted through PASOK’s main organisational transformations. Our analysis covers the period between 1989 and 2019. Research data derives from the original data set ‘Members of the Greek Parliament (1989–2019)’ of the National Centre of Social Research (EKKE). Findings were divided into three main research periods based on party’s transformations. The first period (1989–1996) is that of the ‘partisan’ representative which is characterised by a traditional profile in terms of sociodemographic characteristics and political experience. During the second period (1996–2012) is evident the ‘pluralistic’ representative which has as main characteristics the differentiation in terms of demographic profile and trajectories. Finally, the last period (2012–2019) is monitored by the ‘cadre’ representative which has as determinant factor the ‘survival’ of some influential MPs of the pre-crisis periods. Given that findings, to a large extent, can be correlated to party’s transformations it can be argued that MPs’ changes, throughout the period, constitute an additional interpreting dimension of PASOK’s route towards ‘Pasokification’.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Political Sociology', 'Political Communication', 'Political Leadership']"

In particular, the macroscopic flow theory of plasticity combined with the concept of isotropic hardening, in which a single monotonic stress-strain curve serves as a reference, is briefly reviewed. Selected non-proportional loading test procedures are described and the main deviations of the material behavior compared to an isotropic hardening response are discussed on the basis of underlying mechanisms of deformation at lower scale. The failure of isotropic hardening to accurately capture the behavior of a material subjected to non-linear strain paths demonstrates the need for more advanced hardening theories. Thus, theories based on kinematic hardening, possibly combined with distortional plasticity concepts, are succinctly reviewed. A pressure-dependent, distortional-only, plasticity approach recently proposed is discussed in more details and its relevance is illustrated with the prediction of stress-strain curves of advanced high strength steel sheets deformed along non-linear strain paths. A finite element (FE) implementation of this distortional plasticity model is outlined, with special attention to the formulation of the stress integration algorithm and the elasto-plastic tangent tensor. Application examples on several steel sheet samples subjected to various strain path changes are given for validation purpose. Simulations are conducted with a stand-alone (SA) code containing the constitutive equations only and a FE code with only one element. Comparisons between these predictions and experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of the model and the excellent performance of the FE implementation. Applications on advanced high strength steel (AHSS) sheet demonstrate why the pressure-dependency in the model is an important feature.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Structural Materials', 'Classical and Continuum Physics']"

We can employ it to inform decision making processes based on ethical considerations, as a measure to ensure redundancy that helps us in avoiding system failure, as well as for verifying that autonomous systems remain trustworthy by testing for unwanted responsibility voids in advance. We follow recent proposals to use probabilities as the basis for responsibility ascription in uncertain environments rather than the deterministic causal views employed in much of the previous formal philosophical literature. Using an axiomatic approach we formally evaluate the qualities of (classes of) proposed responsibility functions. To this end, we decompose the computation of the responsibility a group carries for an outcome into the computation of values that we assign to its members for individual decisions leading to that outcome, paired with an appropriate aggregation function. Next, we discuss a number of intuitively desirable properties for each of these contributing functions. We find an incompatibility between axioms determining upper and lower bounds for the values assigned at the member level. Regarding the aggregation from member-level values to group-level responsibility we are able to axiomatically characterise one promising aggregation function. Finally, we present two maximally axiom compliant group-level responsibility measures – one respecting the lower bound axioms at the member level and one respecting the corresponding upper bound axioms.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This chapter opens a small window with some examples that can serve to understand a little bit the trends of some (not all) sectors that are in full expansion all over the world simultaneously, with their pros and cons. There is a need to change the rules of the game, the paradigms to which we have so far been working with. It is not a simple exercise. It needs a lot of will and a deep understanding of what are the limits and dangers of the old model in which we still live immersed. Many examples show that the actual model runs too fast and has a direct impact on natural resources and ecosystem functioning. In this framework, aquaculture is coming under specific scrutiny. We have gone from an almost negligible aquaculture figure in the ‘70s in terms of fisheries production, to almost half of the biomass extracted from the sea and continental waters from this “farming” activity. This is a considerable achievement, but it has its consequences. The impact of monocultures (salmon, shrimp, etc.) has been, in many places, equal to or worse than overfishing. Eutrophication, salinization, introduction of drugs to contain diseases, the use of wild fish to feed mariculture species or the systematic hunting of potential predators (eagles, seals, etc.) are only some of the problems associated with aquaculture nowadays. The impact on wild ecosystems such as mangroves or fjords is very relevant, and has been highlighted as one of the most important problems to be solved in coastal waters. A new vision is that of the Integrated Multitrophic Aquaculture. This is a method that is gaining strength and that may be the change we need, especially if we move from species of high energy and carbon investment (carnivores) to those species that require less energetic effort (such as bivalves, macroalgae, holothurians, etc.). To do this, one of the first things to do is a good forecast of the impact of climate change, selecting the most suitable organisms (and areas) according to the changing environmental conditions. The regional possibilities (i.e., those areas that may be suitable for a mariculture expansion) and the carrying capacity of the surrounding ecosystems according to different areas must also be taken into account if we want a significant paradigm change. Also, the inclusion of stakeholders and clear co-governance roles of these kind of infrastructures has to be understood as a tool to a successful management of the products that will be available for the local people. The Blue Growth related to the mariculture is not the only open front for the future. The use of microalgae is another type of approach to a future in which low-energy cost organisms are gradually taking center stage. The possibilities have a wide spectrum, and now these microorganisms are beginning to be applied industrially in nutraceuticals, biofuels or for the generation of interesting molecules for biomedical applications. The solutions are there, and changing the priorities and the way we apply the different discoveries to be in line with SDG14 in this Blue Growth strategy is a challenge. In fact, it is not all positive prospects in Blue Growth. There are cases in which excessive acceleration of production and inadequate management of “new generation” resources can cause stress on systems, especially in places with fragile ecosystem balances. In addition, considering the production of alternative energies such as offshore wind, or the new planning of maritime traffic, we have to deeply change our way to proceed. The Blue Growth roadmap must change the paradigm if we really want to consider it sustainable. New solutions and new perspectives in a changing world that require spatial planning and a very different model of resource management than the one we are now applying are urgently needed, considering new models of production, economy and social interaction.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"

From a fundamental point of view, language should depict and symbolize culture following the concept of a time capsule. CultTag proposes a research model which does precisely this with the help of the Wikipedia database. CultTag brings in semantics that has been conveniently absent to date in this field of textual recommendation. It is a model that contextualizes the input based on user preferences to recommend socially and culturally relevant hashtags. The implication of culture majorly refers to the popular culture of social media in trend today. Graph traversal is used to reach the related articles from the root node, and the network of anchor links becomes the graph itself. A combination of in-bound and out-bound connections in a seemingly multi-relational network is used to rank the list of hashtags obtained as a result of the traversal. The results obtained reinforce a facet of improvement over the Twitter hashtag prompting system that only includes results of a simple string matching. The amalgamation of CultTag with the widely popular social media networks’ recommendation systems is an exciting prospect to consider.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Here non-Newtonian flow problem is attempted to solve through cascade-forward type artificial neural network (CFANN). The governing equations are solved using the least square method (LSM). The velocity and the temperature distributions being computed by LSM are then used for training of CFANN model. Three different values of hidden layer neurons are used in the CFANN. A velocity distribution is used as input and commensurate temperature profile is received as output. The error in the output from the CFANN is compared for varying number of hidden layer neurons. Present CFANN approach intends to solve various alterations of the present problem within short time, once training for limited cases is complete. Value of A is retrieved within high accuracy of 1.75%, with four hidden neurons.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-19467-2_2,en,Marine Solid Pollution—From Macroplastics to Nanoplastics,OriginalPaper,"It is not surprising that we are interested in plastics as one of the most prominent polluting agents of the twenty-first century. We have gone from producing less than 10 million tons in the 1960s to more than 300 million in the 2010s. That plastic has had time to distribute itself, fragment and enter food chains of the oceans. Studies related to the three phenomena are now one of the main objectives of various research projects and groups around the planet. The first is understanding how fragmentation is increasing the volume of macro and microplastics, how they are dispersed at the oceanic and local level, and what their chemical characteristics are. In line with these observations and quantifications, we have to understand what influence they have on organisms and how we can reduce their concentration. For example, the displacements of macroplastics are modeled relative to their dispersion according to global and local currents, giving importance to the phenomena of fouling and fragmentation, as well as understanding how the creation of microplastics is heterogeneous according to latitude, water temperatures or seasonal conditions. One of the biggest problems is, without a doubt, the chemical, morphological and size classification of plastics, especially micro and nanoplastics. This topic is crucial, as is the standardization of the measures that we consider to classify them in one way or another. This topic has been largely discussed during the last decade, and in this chapter there are cues to understand that the consensus is very close. Other issues are still pending in the complex agenda of the understanding of these pollutants. For example, the adherence of certain types of elements such as heavy metals is a relevant issue on which much information is lacking. But it is not the only knowledge gap that we have. Dynamics in the water column and in the sediment is also a main issue, since this sediment is a sink for microplastics and nanoplastics that is continually disturbed by organisms from the meiofauna. Some of these microplastics become airborne, and their range from likely emission sources is still poorly understood. The understanding of these fluxes from the land-river to the sediments passing through the water column is one of the main challenges to solve the problems derived from the presence of such macro, micro and nano items. Marine organisms are the ones that, apparently, are the most affected by this increase in solid contamination, especially microplastics. Today they are found at any latitude, from the poles to the equator, even in places as surprising as sea ice or abyssal depths. In fact, microplastics are found in very remote places, interfering with the diet of various planktonic and benthic organisms. There are many questions to be resolved, among others, how temperature affects the retention of microplastics in organisms, or which are the most vulnerable species. And we have to understand one important issue: many of those marine organisms affected by micro and nano plastics are part of our diet. Therefore, understanding the rate of transmission in food chains in general and in our consumption in particular is a major issue. That is why we looked for solutions, such as the use of bioremediators (active suspension feeders such as sponges, sea squirts, etc.) in areas where the abundance of microplastics is especially high. Bacteria are also beginning to be used as active decomposers of microplastics, a solution that could help eliminate a large amount of this material about which we still have too many knowledge gaps regarding the health of ecosystems and our own health. The synergy of efforts to understand all these different variables is crucial. During the next decade we do have to solve this plastic problem, with coordination, standardization and the application of different tools to execute the solutions of different associated problems.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"

This type of failure occurs due to the column does not have sufficient shear reinforcement to support earthquake loads. Many studies have been carried out on shear failure in reinforced concrete. Munawir et al. (2012) have conducted research with several different placements of shear reinforcement. It has been found that the placement of shear reinforcement affects the confinement of reinforced concrete columns. Predicting the failure pattern of reinforced concrete columns using the finite element method is a challenge today. With the development of finite element method software this has become possible. This type of research has been developed recently, because it can be more efficient than research in the laboratory. The objectives of this research are to study the behavior of columns that carried axial loads and lateral loads and to predict crack pattern using software non-linear finite element method called ATENA V5. There were two specimens which have been tested experimentally by Munawir, et.al, 2012. There were two variations, namely three arms and crossties of stirrup reinforcement with axial load 0.3P 0 . Reinforced concrete column specimen with a square cross section of size 20 × 20 cm 2 with 58 cm height. Main reinforcement were 12D11.6 mm, and stirrup reinforcement was D5.4 mm. Concrete compression strength ( $${\text{f}}_{c}^{^{\prime}}$$ f c ′ ) was 24.19 MPa. Reinforcement tensile strength was 356 MPa. In three arms of stirrup reinforcement specimens, It has been found that based on ATENA V.5 result, the shear load was 150 Mpa. The difference with experimental result was 2.08%. Based on ATENA V.5 result for deflection was 19.36 mm. The difference with experimental result was 12.43%. On the other hand, in crossties of stirrup specimen, it has been found that based on ATENA V.5 result, the shear load was 150 Mpa. The difference with experimental result was 3.88%. Based on ATENA V.5 result for deflection was 23.21 mm. The difference with experimental result was 23.21%. Meanwhile, prediction of crack pattern by non-linear finite element show the same pattern with experimental results for both three arms and crossties of stirrup reinforcement. The failure mode which has been found from numerical analysis showed that all columns had shear failure.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Classical and Continuum Physics', 'Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis']"

Traditionally, the professional structure of higher education has provided restricted employment, career, and leadership opportunities for women, which is exacerbated where there is an intersection with race, culture, religion, or age. Women continue to be underrepresented in academia across various disciplines and this lack of representation in senior positions within the professional structure of higher education itself acts as a barrier to more women reaching senior levels within institutions. More women are needed in higher positions to increase representation and visibility, to be truly inclusive of all, and to encourage and mentor others to then aspire to follow a similar path. This critical review examines gender equity across the major career benchmarks of the academy in light of the impact of the personal contexts of women, systemic processes that hinder career progression, inclusion and cultural barriers that impede promotion and career progression. Research-based systemic, inclusive solutions are discussed that work towards improved gender equity for all women. The findings from this critical review highlight the need for systemic change globally in higher education to create equities that are inclusionary in the employment, career, and leadership opportunities for women.","['Education', 'Education, general', 'Pedagogic Psychology', 'International and Comparative Education']"

The audit detects procedural failures by election officials and aggregation fraud (rigging that occurs in results transmission), and can deter administrative problems and corruption by announcing the audit to polling officials. First deployed in Afghanistan, iterations in Uganda and Kenya helped develop usage across national coverage and new mobile devices. This pivoted to broadening adoption and functionality using a crowdsourced platform in South Africa, VIP:Voice, that recruited citizen users through ICT channels with no pre-existing infrastructure and incorporates volunteers for photo quick count. This case furthers evidence on instruments for policy guidance on the mechanisms and cost-effective tools to bolster institutional performance and elections at scale.","['Environment', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Development Economics', 'Development and Sustainability', 'Engineering Design', 'Social/Human Development Studies']"

Donors’ provision of foreign aid and technical assistance expanded the PA’s tax base and developed new tax systems and policies. However, these taxes fell under the direct control of the Israeli government through the clearance revenue mechanism. The mechanism affected the PA in ways that hindered its ability to further expand its tax base and marginalised its role in the importation process from Israel and the rest of the world, which accounted for a large portion of total economic activity.

Critical criminologists, both those who identify as formerly incarcerated and as ‘noncons’ or prisoner allies (for example, see ‘Qualities of a Prisoner Ally’ information sheet created by prisoners of the Prisoner’s Justice Day Committee, Vancouver, BC. Available at: https://penalpress.com ), have taken up this charge primarily via qualitative research that incorporates fieldwork, interviews, observation and autoethnography – and where possible, ethnography. Following the edict ‘nothing about us, without us’, convict criminology advances a critical approach to prison research that centres notions of justice, diversity and inclusivity as primary research values. We situate this chapter within a CC perspective to help us unpack the emotional labour involved in doing critical prison research. Given the traumatic nature and long-lasting effects of incarceration, we showcase how this kind of inclusion and representation in critical prison research can take different emotional tolls on formerly incarcerated scholars. Using the second author’s lived experience of incarceration and her participation in a large-scale qualitative research project on the emotional geography of the Canadian federal penal landscape as the primary object lesson, we also outline the advantages of inclusive research team membership for the project and those who are involved in it, namely, the differently located research team members as well as the participants. We conclude the chapter with a discussion of some of the ways that allied prison researchers can support their research assistants, graduate students and colleagues with criminal histories as they cope with the emotional labour of conducting critical prison research and outline a series of possible coping strategies for researchers who are exposed to and who may be struggling with the emotional toll of the research topic and content, including the intense and oftentimes emotional participant interactions and observations they witness while in the field.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Research Methods in Criminology', 'Critical Criminology', 'Criminological Theory']"

A hard lockdown was imposed to cope with the first wave. Crisis management remained a depoliticized issue as the political parties and civil society more generally united behind the efforts to combat the pandemic. After the first wave, crisis management became more politicized, as the opposition complained about a lack of genuine consultation and as some civil society groups were disappointed by a late and lukewarm response to the second wave. Overall, crisis management was most successful when it combined authority with clear rules and good communication, but became less effective when rules became more complex.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Comparative Politics']"

The colossal increase in dependency on the World Wide Web is commensurate to the increase of digitization of documents. Along with this growth has come the need for accelerated knowledge management—automated aid in organizing, analysing, retrieving and presenting content in a useful and distributed manner. For a fair, cogent and strong legal case to be built, the individual fighting the case must have access to case documents from not only several years ago but also a few months ago. Any particular part of any of these various cases that received a verdict in the previous years could be beneficial to the individual’s case. Considering all these factors, it is evident to develop a search engine for legal documents which will provide the user with all the relevant documents it requires. Moreover, unlike widely accessible documents on the Internet, where search and categorization services are generally free, the legal profession is still largely a fee-for-service field that makes the quality (in terms of performance metrics used such as precision and recall) a key difference in services provided. This paper proposes a unique approach to cluster these documents using the mini batch k-means algorithm on dimensionally reduced sentence embeddings generated with the use of DistilBERT and UMAP. The proposed approach has been compared to state-of-the-art topic modelling and clustering approaches and has outperformed them.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence']"

It covers the period from its publication in 1910 to 1966 the year Monopoly Capital by Paul Sweezy and Paul Baran came out. I will show that the ideas associated with Finance Capital dominated economic thinking in the left during the second and third decades of the twentieth century. In the 1930s the Great Depression marked a setback for the book’s prestige. However, important economists, like Natali Moszkowska and Paul Sweezy, who elaborated on the realization/underconsumption version of monopoly theory during that period, initiated fresh interest in this line of thought. It was the conclusion of an intellectual effort that stemmed from the insights of Rosa Luxemburg. Their input established a scientific paradigm that gained recognition in the economic profession. Moreover, it offers an analytical explanation for the booming growth of finance following 1980 and the economic crisis which began in 2007/2008. The most serious criticism toward Hilferding, Moszkowska, and Sweezy is that their conclusions rely on the neoclassical theory of perfect competition and its “dark side”, that is monopoly “price setting”. Neoclassical monopoly pricing means the rejection of the labor theory of value and constitutes a different argument from the one in Marx.","['Economics', 'Social Choice/Welfare Economics/Public Choice/Political Economy', 'Political Economy/Economic Systems', 'History of Economic Thought/Methodology', 'European Politics']"

Attacks against these systems shall be handled both in terms of safety and security. Networked control technologies imposed by industrial standards already cover the safety dimension. From a security standpoint, the literature has shown that using only cyber information to handle the security of cyber-physical systems is not sufficient, since physical malicious actions, that can threaten the correct performance of the systems, are ignored. For this reason, cyber-physical systems should be protected from threats to their cyber and physical layers. Some authors handle the attacks by using physical attestations of the underlying processes. For instance, the use of physical watermarking can complement the protection techniques at the cyber layer, in order to ensure the truthfulness of the process. These detectors work properly if the adversaries do not have enough knowledge to mislead cross-layer (e.g., cyber and physical) data. Nevertheless, adversaries able to acquire enough knowledge from both layers may evade detection. The solutions listed in this chapter handle those aforementioned limitations. The chapter starts by showing shortcomings of classical stationary watermark-based fault detectors, extended to detect, in addition to failures, malicious actions. It is shown that classical stationary watermark-based detectors are unable to identify cyber-physical adversaries. Specifically, they may only detect adversaries that do not attempt to get additional knowledge about the system dynamics. An analysis about the performance of a specific stationary watermark-based fault detector is presented. A new threat model is assumed, in which adversaries may now infer system dynamics by correlating both cyber and physical data. The goal of such adversaries is to evade detection. Under this new threat model, adversaries can now evade detection with high probability. To handle the issue, an extended strategy is presented. The idea is to transform the classical (stationary) approach into a non-stationary watermark-based detector. The new design is shown to handle the extended threat model. It is also shown new ways to combine control and communication strategies, to boost the detection performance. The new solutions are validated using both numeric simulations and cyber-physical testbeds. Ideas for future work are also presented.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Security Science and Technology']"

Over past years, numerous attempts to minimize the associated effects on the environment by using more sustainable materials or by improving the performance of the material (e.g. high strength concrete, fiber reinforcement) have been introduced. The increase in material performance must be accompanied by better models and design approaches to take full advantage of the potential benefits. In this contribution, a discrete fiber and a multi-level model for the analysis of SFRC structures are used to assess the influence of a chosen fiber type, content, and orientation on the structural response. Zero-thickness cohesive interface elements capture the post-cracking behavior. The discrete fibers are modeled using truss elements. The bond between fibers and concrete is modeled using an elastoplastic bond-slip law, and the effects of fiber bending, friction, and matrix spalling are accounted for using a sub-model at the level of the interface element. The predictive capabilities of both models are validated and compared with fiber pull-out experiments. Finally, the prospects of applying complex FE models in conjunction with methods of optimization to design an SFRC tunnel lining segment are discussed. The objective is to minimize the total segment thickness and the fiber content while a constraint ensures that the required failure probability is retained.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Structural Materials', 'Sustainable Development', 'Mathematical Modeling and Industrial Mathematics']"

Fuel mass flow rate, rate of bank angle, amount of fuel, and angle of attack as considered as constraints. The final flight path angle and minimum final velocity constraints are added for a high probability of interception and maneuverability. Lift/drag coefficients and specific impulse which are functions of Mach number, angle of attack, and altitude, were handled with the lagging technique. These parameters are fixed at the current optimization iteration and updated at the next iteration. The original problem is converted to a free-final time problem using a time scale variable, which is an additional optimization variable. In the Pseudo-Spectral method, states and inputs are approximated with the Lagrange polynomial at every flipped Legendre–Gauss-Radau (LGR) collocation point. Dynamic constraints and other constraints are transcribed to algebraic equations at these LGR points. This discretized problem is solved with a MATLAB optimization solver, and values of states and inputs at every LGR collocation point are obtained. The Pseudo-Spectral method is proven to be effective in solving a trajectory optimization problem having realistic constraints, and is robust in solving trajectory optimization problems with a crude initial guess. A numerical simulation validates that this method produces accurate results with a small number of node points.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

The analysis of the socio-psychological and criminological characteristics of drivers accused of committing transport crimes constitutes the purpose of this scientific work. The Author puts forward the working hypothesis that the drivers of road vehicles responsible for traffic accidents have distinctive ideological, subcultural, motivational and characterological (pathocharacterological) shortcomings/problems, as well clear signs of maladaptation and desocialization. The following tools and methods were used in this study—statistical, documentary, experimental psychological methods, sociological methods of questioning and personality analysis. The materials of specific criminal cases on transport crimes, acts of judicial psychiatric, narcological, psychological and technical examinations, as well as the results of surveys and interviews of the drivers themselves (the accused) were used as the empirical basis of this Article. It was concluded that the core pattern of deviant (aggressive, scatterbrained, provocative or criminally motivated) behavior of drivers is a heterogeneous group of personality disorders manifested as a destructive sociopathic complex. The most striking manifestations of such complex include the following—complete disregard for moral norms, low level of culture, emotional-volitional imbalance, hyper aggressiveness, impulsiveness, a tendency to addictive lifestyle, low empathy, and narcissism.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

An important aspect of collaboration in blockchain ecosystems is governance. Proper governance also ensures sustainable growth of a blockchain solution. The current body of knowledge features a growing number of contributions on this topic. This is promising as it allows for a meta-view of what entails governance, which has been done with some lenses, usually with an empirical one. This study focuses on comparing the empirical approach with the theoretical approach by looking at existing dimensions and characteristics that define blockchain governance, using an SLR. This resulted in identifying 11/18 dimensions and 18/42 underlying characteristics that were not identified in literature, 3 new and 14/18 overlapping dimensions and 26/42 underlying characteristics. The newly identified dimensions include (1) Incentives, (2) Trust, and (3) Smart Contracts. Future research should focus to extend on the blockchain governance taxonomies so that they can be operationalized. This helps better understanding of what entails blockchain governance from a conceptual level but will also aid blockchain professionals to design their blockchain governance in a sustainable way, taking into account all stakeholders.","['Business and Management', 'IT in Business', 'Business Information Systems', 'Organization', 'Business and Management, general', 'Organizational Studies, Economic Sociology']"

For the numerical simulation a new viscoplastic constitutive law V isco S alt 2017 was developed and implemented into a Finite-Element-(FE) program to use it for the analysis of the stability and the serviceability of the tailings heaps and of infrastructure constructions in the area around these heaps. The strongly time-variable deformation behaviour and the strongly velocity dependent strength behaviour lead to unstoppable deformation processes of the tailings heaps with large ranges. Displacements in the area around the tailings heaps can be measured in distances of more than 200 m.

Abstraction is an effective tool for managing the complexity of these integrated systems. The abstract models described in this chapter exclusively focus on information relevant to a specific design objective. A graph is an effective tool for managing the complexity of large scale VLSI systems. By reducing the complex components of a VLSI system into nodes and edges, the design effort can be concentrated on the key features of a system while discarding extraneous information. The significance of graph theory at every abstraction layer of the VLSI design process is discussed in this chapter. At the register transfer layer, register allocation is often achieved by graph coloring, minimizing the communication between the CPU and memory. Ordered binary decision diagrams and AND-inverter graphs enable efficient graph-based processing of logic circuits. Graph-based techniques, such as random walks and network flow theory, facilitate the circuit analysis process of VLSI systems. Physical design is greatly enhanced by applying graph optimization algorithms to circuit partitioning, floorplanning, placement, and routing.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems']"

It shows, how important it is to clarify terms beforehand, as there are not always unique definitions and understanding by humans about AI. It highlights that an AI system does not represent a robot or physical machine. The software can be operated on different kinds of hardware systems or platforms but does not require to have any physical shape. Section 2.2 gives an overview of different AI technology aspects. It shows the differences in data computation and progress between humans and computer systems. Section 2.3 describes several AI technologies and highlights the challenge of generated bias. If the AI algorithm gets trained with an already biased data set whether that can happen with consciousness or not, it will not generate a “better human.” The next Sect. 2.4 lists some AI challenges. A current main challenge is that humans still see AI systems as robots or machines and think of physical threats or opportunities. As AI systems can be only software modules, it is recommended to shift the broad society discussions from an attacking Terminator robot to broader ethics and responsibility discussion. Every citizen should take responsibility and proactive actions to shape “Friendly AI” systems. Like every technology, also AI can get abused and used in a not general friendly way. Section 2.5 describes opportunities and risks of AI technology. As humans stopped being goal driven, Section 2.6 highlights the scenario, where future AI systems might overtake the definition of goals for humans. To generate a broad awareness within society to develop and implement AI systems in daily life, it needs acceptance, transparency, and understanding.

It is usually available as exergy and anergy. Exergy is a useful part of energy, also known as available energy. Anergy is the counterpart of exergy, also known as unavailable energy. Thermodynamics is the science associated with energy and exergy, thereby ensuring both laws of thermodynamics—the first and the second by incorporating energy and exergy efficiencies. Refrigeration is a technology to preserve commodities at lower temperatures than their surroundings. One of the most widely used refrigeration systems is a vapour compression refrigeration system whose basic objective is to produce a refrigerating effect at the desired location. Commercial large capacity plants consist of the preservation of a different variety of food items requiring different preservation temperatures. It needs to maintain the evaporators correspondingly at different required temperatures. It requires multi-staging in compressors to save the compressor energy consumption. Exergy efficiency governs the actual performance of the system by knowing its deviation from the ideal one, and thus, is a true measure of any system performance. In this paper, an exergetic investigation of a multistage multi-evaporator vapour compression refrigeration system with individual expansion valves using R22 refrigerant is carried out. A shell and helical type heat exchanger is inbuilt as an intercooler between two compression stages comprises of refrigerant on both—shell and tube side. The two evaporators are maintained at −10 °C and 10 °C. Various parameters like exergy destruction and exergy efficiency are computed. Compressor consumes the maximum exergy destruction among all the components. Variation of exergy efficiency with different parameters is represented in graphical forms. Exergy analysis is a well-known technique and proved to be an alone tool for evaluating and comparing systems more meaningfully. It also helps to improve and optimize the design and analysis of a system.","['Energy', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Environmental Policy', 'Sociology, general']"

The purpose of this chapter is to understand why and how Vision Zero was introduced as well as by whom and with what tools. The chapter focuses on understanding this policy change in New York City and is based on a document study and 18 semi-structured interview with 19 respondents city administration staff, researchers, media, and NGOs. The analysis is made by looking closer at the state of four aspects by the time of the establishment of Vision Zero – problem framing, policy formulation, political actors, and proposed solutions. This theoretical framework is mainly based on the work of John Kingdon (Agenda, Alternatives, and Public Policies. Little, Brown, Boston, 1984) and Michael Howlett (Public Policy Adm 34(4):405–430, 2019). The chapter states that there were several factors leading to the adoption of Vision Zero. First, the road safety problems were not as serious as in many other regions of the USA, but compared to other major cities in the western world, the fatalities and serious injuries in New York City were deemed unacceptable by politicians, NGOs, and the public. The imminent problem on the ground was further emphasized by several high-profile cases of child fatalities in traffic crashes. Second, the Vision Zero policy or philosophy was a coherent and above all a successfully tested policy based on a scientific foundation. The credit for introducing Vision Zero in the New York City context is given to non-governmental organizations such as Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets and specific public administrators in key positions. These actors were all searching for new solutions, and as the politicians placed road safety high on the agenda, a window of opportunity was opened to Vision Zero. In addition, politicians, with the support and pressure from NGOs, established a policy program based on Vision Zero, and this program further established a belief in Vision Zero as a credible way forward. There was and is criticism directed towards the policy based on equity and that Vision Zero risks strengthening discriminatory structures. The basic idea of adapting the physical infrastructure to accommodate human mistakes is challenging in many American contexts, but in a diverse city such as New York, this approach may be able to address equity, according to several respondents, if based on solid crash data. The Vision Zero in New York City differs from the original Swedish version in mainly two ways: the focus in New York on law enforcement and on the behavior of the individual road user.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

An accident involving an e-bike was reconstructed based on an automatic operation framework, then the reliability of the reconstruction model was verified from comparisons of rider’s kinematics, the rest position of three participants, and injury with accident information. Furthermore, a total of 1296 parametric cases were performed by the automatic operation framework, which was based on the validated model with a full factorial experimental design according to the collision boundary such as velocity, position, and angle from accidents. Finally, a data set with 1005 valid cases were used to discuss the distribution patterns of the head’s kinematics and injury response when colliding with the vehicle such as initial impacting time, linear and angular velocity, WAD, and also for head injury criteria (HIC 15 ). The results show that WAD is positively correlated with the size of the rider and vehicle speed. All head contact points on the vehicle are located before WAD2100, and WAD1100–1600 should be considered significant for riders’ protection. 92% of the head impacting linear velocity are lower than 50 km/ h,78% is less than 40 km/h. Head collision angle of 50–70° accounts for 62%, and the average angle of 5 th ,50 th ,95 th are 57°, 61°, 62° respectively. Head subsystem impactor, within test area of WAD1000–2100 and with impacting velocity of 40 km/h and angle of 65° in current pedestrian protection regulation, seems to be applicable to the boundary of test and evaluation for SUV to e-bike riders. 82% of cases with head initial collision time are less than 140ms, and head injuries of e-bike riders mainly come from ground collisions. As a preliminary exploration, distribution patterns of rider’s kinematics and injury response in this article will provide data and theoretical support for formulation and revision of evaluation regulations and also for the development of safety performance when considering e-bike rider’s protection.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering']"

Acting through the existential quantifier, the One is pure giving—it gives existence to all the beings. In the beginning is the One, and the One is the earth, and the One is in the earth. Buried in the earth, the One is the hidden root of the tree of beings. From the earth, all things emerge. Ancient Platonists and modern pagans build altars, and the One is the power in every altar.

Regarding reinforced concrete shallow foundations of onshore wind turbine steel towers, possible reductions of reinforcement obtainable by employing steel fibre-reinforced concrete (SFRC) may increase their sustainability, speed of erection, and competitiveness. At the same time, there is a strong need to extend the life of foundations erected more than 15 years ago, originally designed for only 20 years. The paper presents a numerical investigation based on the results of a research programme in progress at Politecnico di Milano with ENEL, concerning the reinforcement with steel fibres of concrete shallow foundations embedded in a sandy soil subjected to both cyclic and monotonic loading. The approach takes advantage from a careful modelling of soil-structure interaction to highlight the safety margins correlated to conventional design and shows how the multi-directional resistance of SFRC allows a significant reduction of resources, preventing any brittle behaviour correlated to a reinforcement reduction.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Structural Materials', 'Sustainable Development', 'Mathematical Modeling and Industrial Mathematics']"

The public policy of the “30 glorious years” (1945–1975) in Spain and later neoliberal privatizations paved the way for productive accumulation to be replaced by financial accumulation, which, to a large extent, is speculative. Working- and middle-class majorities are disintegrating; broad sectors of society have become atomized and are being subject to increasingly precarious conditions. Inequalities are accentuated, and social class is becoming more diffuse. Is now the time to revive the centralized statism of the post-WWII period? It seems not.

The basic contrast is between statistical and metrological definitions of measurement. The mainstream statistical tradition focuses attention on numbers in centrally planned and executed data analyses, while metrology focuses on distributing meaningfully interpretable instruments throughout networks of end users. The former approaches impose group-level statistics from the top down in homogenizing ways. The latter tracks emergent patterns from the bottom up, feeding them back to end users in custom tailored applications, whose decisions and behaviors are coordinated by means of shared languages. New forms of information and knowledge necessitate new forms of social organization to create them and put them to use.

The theme included also reflections on the extent to which perception can be included in a design or the designed space or object is transformed by the point of view. Possibilities arise in the expansion of space through images or the creation of objects that enable different perceptions depending on the point of view. The experiments studied effective spatial representations, merging of image and real object as well as the creation of images through elements in space. The anamorphoses are not just artistic gimmicks, but they are created by optical-geometric rules and thus provide thought-provoking impulses for reflection on perception and design.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Computational Intelligence']"

This paper addresses the problem of abstract coordination of multiple actors at the goal-level, which often enables us to avoid these problems. Goals in multi-actor settings often rely on the cumulative efforts of a group of distinct actors whose individual, measurable contributions accumulate to lead to the fulfillment of the goal. We formalize these as cumulative goals in a mathematical framework that permits us to measure individual actor contributions on a variety of scales (including qualitative ones). We view these as softgoals , a conception general enough to incorporate the more traditional hardgoals . Within this mathematical setting, we address the coordination problem as one of deciding which actor is allocated to fulfilling each goal of interest (and the associated problem of goal model maintenance). We also report some empirical evaluation results.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

When Claes Tingvall was appointed Director of MUARC, he introduced the concept of “Vision Zero” to Australia and, with it, the “Safe System” approach. While political leaders initially regarded a vision for zero deaths as unachievable, they supported the inherent logic of the Safe System. Initially the Safe System was applied as four independent pillars. While this lack of integration had limitations, it did enable road safety measures to move beyond road user behavior to focus more on safer road infrastructure and vehicle safety. The initial Safe System approach became “Towards Zero” an approach that accepts humans are fragile, and the road system designed to protect from death or serious injury was adopted across all Australia jurisdictions between 2004 and 2018. Public education has been used to introduce and explain Towards Zero and bring greater attention to the importance of purchasing a safe vehicle. Infrastructure investment has moved from a “blackspot” approach to the Safe System approach. However, shifting community and decision-makers’ understanding of the importance of speed limits being set to match the safety standard and design of a road remains a challenge. Future opportunities involve better integration of the components of the Safe System, focusing on serious injuries and improving strategy delivery, performance reporting, management, and accountability.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

This chapter is based on an extensive literature search for criticism of Vision Zero, using the bibliographic databases Philosopher’s Index, Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Phil Papers, and by following the references in the collected documents. Even if the primary emphasis was on Vision Zero in road traffic, our search also included documents criticizing Vision Zero policies in other safety areas, such as public health, the construction and mining industries, and workplaces in general. Based on the findings, we identify and systematically characterize and classify the major arguments that have been put forward against Vision Zero. The most important arguments against Vision Zero can be divided into three major categories: moral arguments, arguments concerning the (goal-setting) rationality of Vision Zero, and arguments aimed at the practical implementation of the goals. We also assess the arguments. Of the 13 identified main arguments, 6 were found to be useful for a constructive discussion on safety improvements.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

The article is devoted to the study of soil hardness, as a universal indicator of its structure, depending on the use of various options for traditional and zero tillage. The advantages of this type of research are given, in comparison with the determination of soil density, the results of hardness values at three stages of soybean ripening, when cultivating the soil with a layer turnover, without a layer turnover, a flat cutter and without tillage (zero technology) are presented. Statistical data processing consisted of primary processing, determination of extreme values, evaluation of data for normal distribution. The conducted analysis of variance determined the difference between the hardness indices on two soil horizons (0.1–0.2 and 0.2–0.3 m). The obtained average values of soil hardness in the area with zero technology at the tillering stage were 1294 kPa at the horizon of 0.2–0.3 m, and at the heading stage 2324 kPa, which is a significant advantage over traditional tillage, since the values presented graphically strongly are different. The smallest significant difference was observed between zero technology and traditional technology at all horizons at two stages of soybean development. At the same time, no significant difference between the two studied soil layers was observed on zero technology, in contrast to traditional tillage.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

We will focus on their use in the treatment of the most common sources of pain in the lumbar spine, i.e., the intervertebral disks (IVDs), the facet joints, and the sacroiliac (SI) joints. The objective of this chapter is to provide a basic overview of the available literature, concept, and guidelines for the safe and effective use of biologic therapy in the lumbar spine, with a focus on axial skeleton pain, including intervertebral disks (IVDs), facet joints, and sacroiliac (SI) joints. We present an initial review of available biologics, as well as the biomechanics of the axial spine, followed by a comprehensive review and analysis of all published clinical studies in the field of regenerative medicine that are relevant to the topics that were reviewed and analyzed. The discovery of biologics has prompted their consideration for alleviating pain and improving function, as well as for potentially restoring the normal structure of the spine.

The simulations are performed using a three-dimensional macroscopic probabilistic model for semi-explicit concrete cracking. As it is well known, concrete structures are largely sensible to the scale effects that can be attributed, among other reasons, to the heterogeneous nature of the material. The model used herein, which is developed in the framework of the finite element method, considers the material heterogeneity through the assumption that each finite element represents a volume of heterogeneous material, with mechanical properties of tensile strength and fracture energy being randomly distributed over the mesh according to the Weibull and lognormal distributions, respectively. The cracks are created with different energy dissipation according to an isotropic damage law. The results are obtained through Monte Carlo simulations using a parallelization strategy with OpenMp to allow feasible 3D simulations of real structures in a viable computational time. With the purpose of modeling the uniaxial tensile test and verifying the prediction of the scale effects, simulations of three prismatic plain concrete specimens with different sizes are performed.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Structural Materials', 'Sustainable Development', 'Mathematical Modeling and Industrial Mathematics']"

Firstly, based on the adaptation methodologies, we have constructed a fully adaptive distributed observer to estimate the status information of the leader. In this observer, an adaptive coefficient is designed so that the observation of the leader’s state can be achieved by the followers without knowing the control input boundary of the leader. Then, exploiting the distributed observer, fully distributed fault-tolerant controllers are developed for MASs to achieve asymptotic tracking of a nonautonomous leader in the presence of time-varying actuator fault.

The performance of stationary compound parabolic collector with linear receiver depends on quality of reflective material, accuracy in design, location of receiver and optimum positioning. It has been observed that, for an accurately designed stationary compound parabolic collector with single linear receiver, reflected radiations are getting lost to the atmosphere without absorption by the receiver. The peripheral area near the receiver tube can be used to collect the reflected untapped radiations. In the current study, a concept of use of two receivers for a compound parabolic collector is proposed. The useful peripheral area near the single receiver is identified using theoretical analysis. The analysis is based on estimation of angle of incidence of beam radiations on the collector and subsequent reflections. To validate the theoretical claims, a pilot experimental study has also been conducted. The theoretical and experimental results confirm the performance improvement of compound parabolic collector with dual receivers. During experiments, for average irradiance of 906 W/m 2 , the maximum outlet temperature of water is found to be 76.60 ℃ with single receiver and it was 95.18 ℃ for dual receivers.

Single-point diamond turning (SPDT) tools offer an advantage over other ultra-precision manufacturing techniques regarding speed and scalability. In this paper, the nanometric cutting of single-crystal silicon using a single-point diamond tool has been simulated using molecular dynamic simulation (MDS). The cutting forces experienced by the tool and the temperature of the workpiece were observed for both negative and positive rake angles and depth of cuts. Tersoff potentials were used in a large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS) to simulate the machining process. It was observed that the cutting temperature of the workpiece was significantly lower for the tools with negative rake angle as compared to that obtained for positive rake angles. Additionally, it was observed that forces on negative rake angle tools are more sensitive to depth of cut compared to positive rake angle tools.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Engineering Design']"

By participating in eight tourist tours, it was determined that the two selected monuments are almost not represented at all, which refers to the lack of cooperation among the sectors and lack of an adequate approach to sustainable tourism development. In addition, the tourism and cultural heritage legislation has been analysed. This has provided an understanding of the causes of the problems identified. In accordance with the obtained research results, certain recommendations are proposed.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Development Studies', 'Environmental Policy', 'Sociology, general', 'Environmental and Sustainability Education']"

Multilayer enclosing structures are often used with the use of heat-insulating materials with a porous structure, which have good heat-shielding properties, and can reduce the thickness and weight of the enclosing structures. The operational properties of such structures and their durability are largely determined by the moisture conditions of the materials. The main goal was to determine heat and moisture transfer in aerated concrete enclosing structures in order to ensure a given temperature regime in the premises. The achievement of this goal was associated with the solution of the following tasks: conducting an experimental study, modeling heat transfer using the example of autoclaved aerated concrete based on the Elcut software package; calculation of the moisture state of structures made of autoclaved aerated concrete at various values ​​of moisture content of aerated concrete blocks. Under various heat and humidity conditions, the characteristics of heat transfer in autoclaved aerated concrete have been experimentally found. Using the Elcut program, models of heat transfer in enclosing structures made of autoclaved aerated concrete were obtained using various brands of autoclaved aerated concrete.

In addition to the old routes to Senegal and Gambia, contemporary movements now extend to Europe and beyond. One of the main destinations is Portugal, where Guinean migrants have been attracted by labour demand in the construction sector since the 1980s. However, the recent economic crisis in Portugal has led many Guinean-born citizens to continue their journeys, searching for better opportunities in Northern Europe and benefiting from the acquisition of Portuguese nationality. In this chapter I explore the connections between onward migration and transnationalism by focusing on the case of Portuguese-Guinean migrants living in Peterborough (the UK). Based on ethnographic material, I discuss how transnational ties and practices across various places – including Guinea-Bissau, the UK, Portugal and other sites in the Guinean diaspora – contribute to the emergence of specific forms of subjectivity, marked by manifold identifications in terms of nationality, language, religion, leisure and food.","['Social Sciences', 'Migration', 'Public Policy']"

The approach is based on coupled finite and boundary element methods involving hypersingular integral equations. Thin shells and plates are considered as structural elements interacting with ideal and incompressible liquids. The fundamental relations of the continuous mechanics are incorporated to describe the motion of structural elements and fluid. The fluid motion is supposed to be irrotational. The Laplace equation with respect to the liquid pressure on the wetted surfaces of the structural elements is obtained, and the corresponding boundary conditions for unilateral and bilateral contact of the structural element with the liquid are formulated. A hypersingular integral equation is obtained for bilateral contact of the structural element with liquid. The finite element method coupled with the boundary element method for the hypersingular integral equation is implemented to find the fluid pressure on the plate. The frequencies and modes of structure vibrations taking into account the added masses of the liquid are obtained. The accuracy and reliability of the proposed method are ascertained.","['Energy', 'Energy Systems', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Structural Materials', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer']"

The challenge of making reasonable, if not strictly rational, forward-looking decisions under uncertainty is aptly summarized by Niels Bohr who stated that “prediction is very difficult, especially about the future”. And yet, predict we must in order to act. This practical imperative gives rise to the science of studying risk that focuses on how one can manage the possible future eventualities in order to achieve a desired outcome. Despite the striking simplicity of this definition, risk management relies heavily on randomness and probability and their interpretation reflects a deep underlying view of how the world functions. Essentially, how one views the world defines how one perceives risk and acts upon it. This chapter reviews the mathematical foundations of modeling risk and provides a first pass at quantitatively measuring it.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Data Engineering']"

Driven by an unwavering belief in the humanist educational tradition, the theories of education, counsel, and rhetoric presented in The Boke Named the Governor (1531) would repeat throughout Elyot’s scholarship, creating a coherent and comprehensive articulation of political counsel within a monarchy. Because Elyot’s work so completely interacts with the political and social reality of his time which was consumed by the reign of Henry VIII, scholarship on Elyot often has trouble separating his written works from his early interactions with Henry. They attribute to Elyot a self-centered desire to appease Henry, to get back into his good graces and reclaim a place at court. Very little scholarly attention has been given to the curriculum Elyot presents in his writing and even less discussed the pedagogical theory Elyot employs. For Elyot education was political, and to try and separate the educational values from his works’ political nature is not only a disservice to Elyot the humanist and intellectual but a complete misreading of Elyot’s historical importance both in the realm of Tudor politics and the history of education. This chapter is an attempt to put education back into Elyot’s political theory of humanist counsel – to offer a cursory understanding of how the two are tightly intwined forming a comprehensive pedagogical theory of humanist political education.","['Education', 'Educational Philosophy', 'History of Education', 'Education, general', 'International and Comparative Education', 'Administration, Organization and Leadership', 'Sociology of Education']"

Shear deformation can be observed, for example, when cutting bars with scissors. There is a net shift, in which only tangential stresses act on the faces of the element. Torsion is a type of deformation in which only the torque acts in the cross-sections, and the other force factors are absent. Rotating and torsion bars are called shafts. Many machine parts are subject to shear or torsion. Therefore, this separate chapter is devoted to the methods of their calculation for strength and rigidity.","['Physics', 'Classical Mechanics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Complexity', 'Classical and Continuum Physics', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Engineering Design']"

Experts claim it has now entered its “third wave” (or “SSC 3.0”)—a typology characterised by state intervention, Public–Private Partnerships and concessional financing. Being one of SSC’s most recognised advocates, China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) stands at the vanguard of this expression of “SSC 3.0.” Yet for all the policy evolutions, the respective fields of study of SSC and the BRI (which coexist in scholarly silos) have predominantly maintained a state-led focus. Confusions often abound too in these respective strands of literature on the association between sources of “third wave” SSC financing and the expression of geopolitical influence. This chapter aims to introduce the manuscript’s contribution to this debate by questioning where the locus of power lies in the realm of “SSC 3.0” as well as revisiting the oft-assumed relationship between economic heft and geopolitical power. The need to question these overlapping analytical tenets is driven by the empirical dynamics comprising the Doraleh disputes. After all, the main protagonists behind them were neither the Chinese nor Emirati governments but instead State-Owned Enterprises (Dubai Ports World, China Merchants) as well as the SSC “receiving party” (i.e. the Djibouti government).","['Political Science and International Relations', 'International Relations', 'Dispute Resolution, Mediation, Arbitration', 'Development Studies', 'Sources and Subjects of International Law, International Organizations']"

With the higher settlement area close to the riverbanks, Jakarta should control its high potency of plastic waste leakage into the river, where 37.76% of the waste generated comes from the residential area as the primary contributor. To comply with the control mechanism, an early warning system of plastic waste outflow should be implemented. This study aims to identify plastic leakage hotspots using spatial analysis of the river before it flows to the ocean. It was conducted into three phases: source leakage identification, hydrological characterization of streamflow, and scenario analysis. In the latter the overall stages were analyzed using geographic information systems (GIS) for plastic waste distribution and location-based topographical feature analysis. Morphometric analysis is used to define the runoff from the subbasin level as the transport of leakage. Data used, including the Greater Jakarta area’s waste management summary in 2020, was transformed comprehensively into the spatial distribution for detection of hotspots. Some of the spatial features include the Digital Elevation Model, population density, LULC and rainfall rate to enable the dispersal of plastic waste leakage. Through morphometric analysis, 19% of watershed resulted from the higher runoff, emphasizing the greater leakage amount into the waterbodies. Leakage hotspots contribute 7.64% of the total unmanaged plastic waste flowing into Jakarta Bay annually. By improving the seasonal scenario, the highest leakage was estimated to be 2.8 kton in February and higher in January as a result of Jakarta special social events. The result of the estimation could be used for better land utilization in the Jakarta area to minimize the plastic waste problem.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Applications', 'Geography, general', 'Sustainable Development']"

Therefore, the challenge of evaluating the social impact related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes evident, since the speed of this transformation leads society to rethink the man-machine interaction, as well as the impacts related to the new forms of work that emerge every day. From this perspective, this study aimed to develop a systematic review of the literature and evaluate qualitatively the main social impacts linked to the use of artificial intelligence, as well as the main mitigation actions, using as database the Web Of Science and Scopus. Nine social impacts and twelve mitigation actions were mapped. Among the impacts, bias and discrimination growth due to the use of AI (26%) stand out, followed by the possibility of autonomous systems hurting humans (16%), and then the impact related to the violation of data, privacy, and freedom (15%). It was evident that the recommendation considered to be the most comprehensive refers to increasing the breadth and depth of public debate regarding the risks of AI application. In second place is the recommendation to create laws, principles, and regulations for the use of AI. The results of this study point to the protection of life and human ethics, which are topics that need to be widely investigated for the dissemination of knowledge, and to enable the sustainable development of AI.","['Social Sciences', 'Science and Technology Studies']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-030-79827-7_7,en,From FinFET to Nanosheets and Beyond,OriginalPaper,"Moore’s law has for more than five decades been the roadmap guiding the semiconductor industry. While originally driven by lithography advancements and material innovation, since the 22 nm/14 nm node, new device architectures like FinFET have been introduced to tackle the increasing challenges related to power efficiency, performance, area scaling, and cost. With the introduction of FinFET, design-technology co-optimization also gained a lot of importance. More than ever, the industry is looking for that magic device concept to continue CMOS scaling beyond the 3 nm technology node. Gate-all-around devices, coming in different flavors (nanowires or nanosheets), have been proposed as possible candidates for keeping leakage under control. These architectures can be seen as an evolutionary step from FinFET. More disruptive is the introduction of high-mobility channel materials like (Si)Ge. While many hurdles have been overcome, especially the lower bandgap and thus higher leakage are still a concern. Next, going 3D seems a straightforward way to continue area scaling. Based on the gate-all-around integration scheme, complementary FET (CFET) where nMOS and pMOS are stacked on top of each other shows potential for not only area scaling but also power-performance improvements, but it comes at the cost of a more complex integration scheme. Finally, as the industry will move more toward heterogeneous integration, sequential 3D, allowing for fine-grained connections between the different layers of active devices, will be key in enabling these more complex systems.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Electronic Circuits and Devices', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation']"

Apel’s work is discussed as a challenge to analytical language philosophy via transcendental semiotics and discourse ethics. Three objections by Apel are identified here as a lacking grounding of objectivism ; methodological solipsism ; and a missing ethical dimension. Apel’s broader aim at reconciling analytic and hermeneutic philosophy is shown to draw on three notions of knowledge-interest : control via objectivity; communicative understanding; and emancipatory self-reflection, argued by means of a normative-hermeneutic social science approach to discourse ethics. The chapter then turns to Jürgen Habermas in his agreement with Apel on the critique of a too narrowly conceived notion of communication. A commentary on his confrontation with Gadamer is followed by an overview of Habermas’s writings on the public sphere , his distinction between purposive-rational action and symbolic interaction, the ideas of communicative competence and distorted communication , and his version of discourse ethics. In conclusion, the chapter identifies Habermas’s three hermeneutic principles, the inevitable involvement of the observer in interpretation, the context dependency of all interpretations, and the Kantian replacement of truth claims by explicatory negotiations.","['Philosophy', 'Continental Philosophy', 'Hermeneutics']"

The values guiding this process are ones of interconnectedness, respect, healing and transformation, engagement, and a non-hierarchical stance. Research across disciplines offers guidance on emerging design principles of a restorative justice-informed design that prioritizes the goals and values of restorative justice. Such design challenges the punitive foundation of incarceration, thus making the idea of a restoratively designed custodial facility impossible. Rather, restorative justice design asks us to remove the design and construction of custodial facilities from the design table and shift our attention toward the design and construction of a constellation of spaces that address survivors’ needs, facilitate meaningful accountability on the part of offenders, and support structural foundations for social justice. Restorative justice-informed design asks what kind of society we want, not what kind of prison we want, clearing the path for decarceration.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

Extreme events can damage these lifelines and disrupt their services. The recovery of one infrastructure not only depends on the extent of damage directly caused by these events but also the recovery of other infrastructures. The Southeastern United States experienced the damage of these infrastructure lifelines caused by hurricanes and tropical storms every year. This study empirically investigated the direct impacts of a recent major hurricane, Hurricane Irma, on transportation infrastructure and its dependencies on other lifelines during the recovery in Southwest Florida—an active hurricane region in the South. The transportation infrastructure of two counties that was directly hit by the hurricane was the subject of the current study. Data were collected from the two county departments of transportation. Group interviews were conducted with six engineers and managers working at the two departments to assess the extent that transportation infrastructure depended on three other infrastructure lifelines, namely energy, water and communications during its recovery. The hurricane caused the outage of all intersections managed by the two transportation departments for at least a short period of time. Electric power and wireless services were considered the most determinants in the initial recovery process. The Federal Highway Administration’s emergency relief policies can prolong the recovery if local transportation agencies do not proactively procure “recovery” contractors prior to extreme events. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding on the dependencies of transportation infrastructure during recovery after hurricanes.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

In the process of mining, miners have to create and publish blocks and within those steps, they can decide to be honest or dishonest about their progress with the block validation. Game theory helps us explore motivations for different decisions.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Computer Applications']"

For the case of massive stars (O and B types), about 10% of them harbor strong, globally ordered (mostly dipolar) magnetic fields. The trapping and channeling of their stellar winds in closed magnetic loops leads to magnetically confined wind shocks (MCWS), with pre-shock flow speeds that are some fraction of the wind terminal speed that can be a few thousand km s −1 . These shocks generate hot plasma, a source of X-rays. In the last decade, several developments took place, notably the determination of the hot plasma properties for a large sample of objects using XMM-Newton and Chandra , as well as fully self-consistent MHD modeling and the identification of shock retreat effects in weak winds. In addition, these objects are often sources of H α emission which is controlled by either sufficiently high mass loss rate or centrifugal breakout. Here we review the theoretical aspects of such magnetic massive star wind dynamics.","['Physics', 'Astrophysics and Astroparticles', 'Astronomy, Observations and Techniques', 'Particle and Nuclear Physics', 'Cosmology']"

This research propose a new approach to select and prioritize relevant targets to the industry, which will allow companies, communities, and public authorities to establish a proper framework for environmental governance. The methodology includes appraisal of questionnaires, prioritization of targets following a thorough screening and quantitative assessment, and a bipartite network analysis approach. The results indicate that 55 out of the 169 targets were considered relevant for oil sands mining. The targets in SDGs 1, 12, and 16 were identified as having high or very high priority. There was high correlation between proposed conditions and targets based on the bipartite analysis, which signifies that the people’s opinion has relevance in the priority ratings. To achieve SDGs, the implication of mining activities on the environment must be addressed. It was concluded that targets with high relevance in the three phases of mining should be given high consideration when establishing governance principles. Furthermore, engagement of relevant stakeholders that will be impacted directly or indirectly by mining operations is critical in the pursuit of achieving SDGs.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Ecology', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Physical Geography', 'Environmental Management', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

As intrinsic interaction patterns also prevail at hierarchically different scales of ecological organization, organismic associations scale-invariantly represent holobiont-like systems (HLSs). This essay explores how high-ranking HLSs (ecosystems, biosphere) do evolve, in particular, under the conventionally gene-centric view at the Darwinian principles of mutation, heredity, and selection. Re-visiting evolution theory, shortcomings by DNA-restricted interpretations impede perceptions of HLS evolution, notably, at hierarchically high ecological scales. Any HLS is discernable as a selection unit, however, through considering genericness by widening DNA-encoded to structurally and functionally stored information upon historical contingencies in “E vo D evo E co ” processes, relating evolution, development, and ecology. On such grounds, HLS evolution proceeds through adaptive cycling and sequential selection, examining predictability versus stochasticity of aggregated information for adaptiveness to environmental variation. Each turn mirroring evolutionary advancement, cycling does not require resource-related competition as evolutionary driver. However, selection is reflected in competition in a sense of facing the challenge to maintain internal stability upon environmental changes. Such challenge becomes evident also in biospheric HLS Earth evolution through traded contingency effects upon manifold biogeochemical impacts. Although repeatedly inciting global species mass extinctions, such were pulse generators towards niches diversification and ecological complexity, owed to recurrent valuing scrutiny of sequential selection. Abandoning gene-centric perspectives, HLS evolution is borne by oscillating phases of consolidation versus renewal.","['Life Sciences', 'Plant Sciences', 'Forestry', 'Plant Biochemistry', 'Ecosystems', 'Plant Genetics and Genomics', 'Plant Physiology']"

In many ways, the prisons were at opposite ends of the penal spectrum in terms of their geographic location, their function, and in relation to their divergent paths from commissioning to the outcome. Only one of the facilities is likely to turn out to be an example of imaginative, humane thinking in contemporary prison design, even though both prisons were initially conceived as such. Put simply, where Auckland East fell foul of a highly risk-averse and security-obsessed corrections culture, Limerick has benefitted from a prison service prepared to take risks and commission a design that is underpinned by research evidence and international best practice. Nonetheless, the experiences that I relate in the chapter underline that, however good the intentions of prison commissioners, planners and architects, the design of the built environment can only go so far in creating a rehabilitative culture in prison.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

A summary of Derrida’s contribution to interpretation theory via his critical infrastructures is followed by a critical discussion of his The Truth in Painting (1978) as an ironic failure to address Kant’s relinquishment of truth in his reflective-teleological judgment. In contrast, Foucault’s archaeology and genealogy are acknowledged as innovative additions to hermeneutics in their emphasis on interpretive dispersion in place of totalization. Foucault’s enunciative modalities are singled out as a necessary, pragmatic critique of speech-act theory. Likewise, Lyotard’s politicization of the Kantian sublime and the concept of the differend as discursive injustice are hailed as significant additions to interpretation theory, but not so his reluctance to address Part II, nor his claim that aesthetic feeling functions as the Critique’s “central pillar.” The chapter approves of Deleuze’s reading of The Critique of Judgment as championing self-realization as the free accord of the cognitive faculties in “The Idea of Genesis in Kant’s Aesthetics” (2002), even if the paper adds to the long-held prejudice of the centrality of Part I of the third Critique.","['Philosophy', 'Continental Philosophy', 'Hermeneutics']"

This paper proposes a sketch-based face recognition (SBFR) method using a modified Mask RCNN framework. The proposed model includes recognition of a person even if there is a change in illumination, age, and facial expression. The method is validated with our local dataset “POPSKETCH,” and it comprises hand-drawn sketches of 28 individuals and converted sketches from original images of 34 individuals.

Solar energy, which generates both heat and light, is the most abundant source of energy. Solar photovoltaic modules use solar radiations to generate electricity and thermal energy, while the remaining solar radiation content is lost to the environment. The first law of thermodynamics was used to perform an energy analysis on a solar photovoltaic module, and the second law of thermodynamics was used to perform an exergy analysis to determine energy losses and exergy efficiency during the photovoltaic conversion process. The operating parameters of a solar photovoltaic module are as follows: ambient temperature, photovoltaic module surface temperature, overall heat transfer coefficient, short circuit current, open circuit voltage, fill factor and solar radiation. These were achieved on a sunny day in the month of February at R.L.J.I.T, Doddaballapur. The experimental data are utilised to calculate the solar photovoltaic module’s energy and exergy efficiencies. The efficiency of the solar panel performance decreases as the temperature of the module rises. As a result, by reducing heat from the surface of the solar photovoltaic module, the module’s efficiency can be increased. Surface heat can be eliminated by delivering water or air as a medium to the solar photovoltaic module. Finally, ANN model was developed to determine the performance prediction models using multilayer perceptron neural network, and it reveals that the developed model with six neurons gives better performance with a confidence interval of 95%.","['Engineering', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Energy Storage']"

These changes (demilitarization of the coasts, end of collective ownership, specialization of economic activities, etc.) are characterized by a fast process of coastalization with the growth of urban areas, coast suburbanization, and the decrease of agricultural land. At the same time, we observe the implementation of protected natural areas at the regional level and through cross-border cooperation with international organizations (UNESCO, European Union [EU], etc.). Both processes have an important impact on the management of the coastlines of Latvia, Lithuania, and Russia. The analysis of the coastal changes is based on the use of Landsat remote sensing data series from the 1980s to 2020 combined with EU geographic databases and the land-use plans. The comparative analysis of the land cover changes in the Oblast of Kaliningrad, Lithuanian, and Latvian coastal zones allows us to understand the impacts of the three different planning policies since the end of the 1980s.

Compared to the state-of-the-art inspection methods of these structures using ultrasonic bulk wave phased array techniques, guided waves provide a mechanism for monitoring inaccessible areas and increasing the testing range to speed up the inspection process. Combining these two approaches, an efficient inspection scheme can be achieved. For this purpose, in this work, the possibility of exciting a single higher order guided wave mode at a low dispersion region is examined, using a conventional linear phased array on a 10 mm thick sample. An analytical model based on modal analysis is derived. Then, the time delays across each element of the array are optimally selected and a necessary condition on the pitch is provided, to enhance the purity of the desired mode. The results are promising, illustrating that single mode excitation is possible at high frequency-thickness products, greater or equal than 15 MHz $$\cdot $$ · mm. Furthermore, the phased array transducer allows for dynamic mode selection capabilities; that is, feeding the appropriate excitation signals on each channel, different modes can be excited, without having to physically alter the transducer configuration.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Loss of synchronization mostly concerns modern wireless SHM systems; however, synchronization discrepancies may also occur in cable-based systems in case multiple data acquisition units without global clock management are used. This paper presents the implementation and validation of a concept towards synchronizing SHM data records containing structural response data, which is imperative for obtaining information valuable for accomplishing monitoring objectives. Specifically, the performance of a cross spectrum synchronization approach reported in a recent study, which builds upon cross spectral density phase angles of structural response data transformed into the frequency domain, is investigated with structural response data from real structures. The cross spectrum synchronization approach is implemented into a wireless SHM system and into a cable-based SHM system, and it is validated through tests on a laboratory shear-frame structure and through field tests on a pedestrian bridge, respectively. The validation test results prove that the cross spectrum synchronization approach is capable of complementing traditional clock synchronization protocols, thus enhancing the accuracy of SHM outcomes.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

This scheme aims to attain optimized solutions by maximizing the accuracy of the model and minimizing the functions like the computational burden. Mathematical-informed frameworks are to be employed to enable reliable, accurate, and robust understanding of various complex biological processes that involve a variety of spatial and temporal scales. This complexity requires a holistic understanding of different biological processes through multi-stage integrative models that are capable of capturing the significant attributes on the related scales. Fractional-order differential and integral equations can provide the generalization of traditional integral and differential equations through the extension of the conceptions with respect to biological processes. In addition, algorithmic complexity (computational complexity), as a way of comparing the efficiency of an algorithm, can enable a better grasping and designing of efficient algorithms in computational biology as well as other related areas of science. It also enables the classification of the computational problems based on their algorithmic complexity, as defined according to the way the resources are required for the solution of the problem, including the execution time and scale with the problem size. Based on a novel mathematical informed framework and multi-staged integrative method concerning algorithmic complexity, this study aims at establishing a robust and accurate model reliant on the combination of fractional-order derivative and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the diagnostic and differentiability predictive purposes for the disease, (diabetes, as a metabolic disorder, in our case) which may display various and transient biological properties. Another aim of this study is benefitting from the concept of algorithmic complexity to obtain the fractional-order derivative with the least complexity in order that it would be possible to achieve the optimized solution. To this end, the following steps were applied and integrated. Firstly, the Caputo fractional-order derivative with three-parametric Mittag-Leffler function $$(\alpha ,~\beta ,~\gamma )$$ ( α , β , γ ) was applied to the diabetes dataset. Thus, new fractional models with varying degrees were established by ensuring data fitting through the fitting algorithm Mittag-Leffler function with three parameters $$(\alpha ,~\beta ,~\gamma )$$ ( α , β , γ ) based on heavy-tailed distributions. Following this application, the new dataset, named the mfc_diabetes, was obtained. Secondly, classical derivative (calculus) was applied to the diabetes dataset, which yielded the cd_diabetes dataset. Subsequently, the performance of the new dataset as obtained from the first step and of the dataset obtained from the second step as well as of the diabetes dataset was compared through the application of the feed forward back propagation (FFBP) algorithm, which is one of the ANN algorithms. Next, the fractional order derivative model which would be the most optimal for the disease was generated. Finally, algorithmic complexity was employed to attain the Caputo fractional-order derivative with the least complexity, or to achieve the optimized solution. This approach through the application of fractional-order calculus to optimization methods and the experimental results have revealed the advantage of maximizing the model’s accuracy and minimizing the cost functions like the computational costs, which points to the applicability of the method proposed in different domains characterized by complex, dynamic and transient components.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Statistics, general', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The most basic requirement for the boiler combustion system is that the combustion flame inside the boiler is stable and uniform, and the flame temperature is the most important combustion characteristic of the combustion flame, so the method of using flame temperature as an intermediate variable to control the boiler system has been concerned by many scholars. Compared with the traditional control method that takes the main steam pressure and other parameters as the control variable, this method greatly reduces the delay of the system, and at the same time improves the stability and economy of the system. In this chapter, a temperature field reconstruction based on the improved two-color temperature measurement is proposed.","['Engineering', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Energy Systems', 'Computational Intelligence']"

Ground on these constraints and using the Lyapunov stability analysis method, our proposed algorithm converges exponentially to the optimal solution over time-varying digraphs. Finally, some simulation results are reported to illustrate the proposed algorithm.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Multiagent Systems', 'Systems Theory, Control']"

Explainability is a central component of such interfaces, particularly in high-stake domains where human oversight is essential: justice, finance, security, and medicine. To successfully build and communicate trustworthiness, a user-centered approach to the design and development of AI solutions and their human interfaces is essential. In this chapter, we explain how proven methods for stakeholder analysis and user testing from human-computer interaction (HCI) research can be adapted to human-AI interaction (HAII) in support of this goal. The practical implementation of a user-centric approach is described within the context of AI applications in computational pathology.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It functions as a heat pump moving heat from one side of the device to the other. The growing adoption of electric vehicles, growing inclination toward renewable energy sources, and increase in demand for energy-efficient consumer electronics are the key factors driving the thermoelectric devices market. However, the high cost of thermoelectric modules, design complexity and heat dissipation issues restrain the market growth. The reduced size of the thermoelectric elements is one goal for TEC module manufacturers. Various benefits can be achieved if TEC is made lighter and smaller. When the size of a TEC is reduced, however, we run into issues with heat transfer. It is difficult to transfer heat (source to sink) when end plates are small in cross-section. Increasing the gap between the TE elements would almost certainly solve the issue. But conduction, convection, and radiation heat losses increase substantially. In recent years, new techniques to design thermoelectric coolers have made significant progress. We summarize recent progress in the design of sustainable thermoelectric cooling devices in this review, which have been established to enhance various performance requirements and add new functionality.","['Energy', 'Energy Systems', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Materials Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

These days the COVID-19 epidemic is affecting not only the health sector but also the economy. Therefore, it is of great importance to build models that appropriately derive and preside over the spread of the epidemic to improve the control of epidemics. As well as to adopt appropriate strategies to avoid or at least mitigate its spread faster, different modeling methods have been proposed to build epidemiological models, we find the use of an agent-based model which makes it possible to reproduce the real behavior of the daily course of individuals already seen in the previous article [ 1 ], However this article presents in the same context stimulates the spread of covid using stochastic SIR model (Susceptible - Infected – Recovered) and its extension SVIRD (Susceptible - Vaccinated - Infected - Recovered – Death) which takes into consideration the vaccination parameter. Results: For a sample of 50 citizens network, we used a combination of simulations for the 4 parameters in SVIRD model, The result of the simulation shows that: The more connected a population is, the higher vaccination rates need to be to effectively protect the population.

The chapter shows that the Vision Zero approach is now integrated into the new EU road safety strategy. The presence of elements of Vision Zero during the different timeframes is presented. These include ethics, shared responsibility, the philosophy of building a system which allows for error and, finally, creating a mechanism for change. The current EU road safety strategy, which adopts these elements, is reviewed in more detail. More recent implementation is illustrated by references to Vision Zero within two recent, important pieces of road safety legislation, on infrastructure and vehicle safety.

These three integrative and reliable methodologies are (i) materiality analysis, (ii) footprint methodologies, and (iii) fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methodology. This chapter focuses on the application of these complementary and mutually supporting methodologies in the field of sustainability and so answers the questions of what needs to be measured, how it can be measured, and what the measurements are to be used for. The chapter justifies the suitability of the three methodologies for adopting an interdisciplinary approach, in the application and achievement of transdisciplinary outcomes in sustainability assessment.","['Business and Management', 'Sustainability Management', 'Economic Geography', 'Diversity Management/Women in Business', 'Law and Economics', 'Business Ethics']"

Ast’s metaphor of the hermeneutic circle is shown to change Kant’s presuppositional relation of parts and wholes into a process anchored in an all-encompassing spirit. On Schleiermacher, the chapter objects to Gadamer’s claim that Schleiermacher rejected all “rational ideas” emanating from the enlightenment. Instead, Schleiermacher is shown to have resumed many of Kant’s proto-hermeneutic ideas: that we can understand authors better than they did themselves, his ubiquitous references to Kant’s image-schematism, interpretation as open-ended, the Kantian rejection of mechanistic explanation and idea of interpretation as indeterminate, continual approximation , or interpretation as an artistic procedure. The chapter then analyses the hermeneutics of Dilthey as a specific understanding of the “human-historical world”, a psychic reality concealed in written documents , a procedure which requires Nachfühlung and Nacherleben via inductive extrapolation. Yet, the chapter concludes, it is precisely Dilthey’s reliance on induction that returns us to a form of determining reason already declared anachronistic in Part II of the Critique of Judgment.","['Philosophy', 'Continental Philosophy', 'Hermeneutics']"

This paper considers three possible solutions to the time optimal control problem for a linear system: Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) feedback control, fuzzy-based bang-bang control, and a hybrid fuzzy-LQR controller. These optimal control techniques are compared using a spacecraft docking task, where the spacecraft must move from an initial state to docking state as quickly as possible. All three controllers are shown to produce an optimal solution and complete the task in minimal time, where the hybrid approach balances the benefits of the LQR and fuzzy approaches.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Engineering']"

The rig-to-reef approach, successfully implemented in other seas of the world, provides an attractive alternative to the complete removal by reefing the underwater oilrig structures and theoretically provides positive environmental, economic, and social benefits to a wide range of stakeholders. This manuscript critically reports and analyzes the risks associated with the implementation of the rig-to-reef approach in Qatar oilfields by using a DPSIR conceptual framework focusing on the pressures, states, impacts, and responses. By portraying reefing approaches as an issue, several pressures were identified including potential navigational safety issue, pollution, and physical disturbances. These pressures are expected to modify the physical, biological, and chemical state of the ecosystems, potentially leading to several impacts, such as the loss of habitats, biodiversity, and associated ecosystem services. The identified hazards and their potential risks were analyzed, and these seemed to be outweighed by the potential benefits of reefing obsolete oil platforms. Nevertheless, the critical impairment to the rig-to-reef implementation, mainly associated to existing regulatory frameworks, should be addressed.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Sustainable Development', 'Development Studies', 'Middle Eastern Politics']"

It is determined that the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by the state to combat it have become catalysts for structural changes in organizations of an organizational and economic, technological and socio-psychological nature. The positive effects and negative consequences of the pandemic and the restrictive lockdowns introduced were assessed using the method of interviewing representatives of Russian business structures. Among the negative consequences, a decrease in the organization’s income, a decline in demand for products, a reduction in economic opportunities for most types of business, a lower efficiency of staff, organizational problems of switching to a remote work format are highlighted. The directions of overcoming the negative consequences of the pandemic for Russian organizations are determined, including the search for additional sources of income, optimization of internal processes, digital transformation. In order to neutralize objectively developing negative processes and potential socio-economic risks and their consequences, the author’s mechanism of adaptation of the organization to new conditions is proposed.","['Business and Management', 'Business Strategy/Leadership', 'Management', 'Economic Growth', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Asian Economics', 'International Organization']"

This chapter will focus on two elements aiming at understanding, predicting, measuring and quality-assuring constructs with examples from memory measurements: (i) explicit methods for testing theories of the measurement mechanism and establishment of metrological standards and (ii) substantive theories explaining the constructs themselves. Building on entropy as a principal explanatory variable, analogous to its use in thermodynamics and information theory, we demonstrate how more fit-for-purpose and valid memory measurements can be enabled. Firstly, memory task difficulty, extracted from a Rasch psychometric analysis of memory measurements of experimental data such as from the European NeuroMET project, can be explained with a construct specification equation (CSE). Based on that understanding, the CSE can facilitate the establishment of objective and scalable units through the generation of novel certified reference “materials” for metrological traceability and comparability. These formulations of CSEs can also guide how best to compose new memory metrics, through a judicious choice of items from various legacy tests guided by entropy-based equivalence, which opens up opportunities for formulating new, less onerous but more sensitive and representative tests. Finally, we propose and demonstrate how to formulate CSEs for person ability, correlated statistically and clinically with sets of biomarkers, that can be a means of providing diagnostic information to enhance clinical decisions and targeted interventions.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Health Informatics', 'Psychometrics', 'Health Administration']"

Reducing the potential for abuse and violence—inmate-on-inmate, inmate-on-staff, and staff-on-inmate—and improving conditions of confinement through design and incentivization blunts negative outcomes and potential future misuse. The work does not end after buildings are constructed, and entrenched cultural issues that may negatively impact safe and effective operations must be addressed. Although designers have limited levers to influence organizational culture, their designs can support safe, secure, and constitutional operations via functionality, adequate flows of people and materials, and environments that promote wellness. However, the adoption of inmate supervision paradigms—especially the extent to which administrators commit to full implementation— drives organizational culture, reduced violence, vandalism, suicides, lower levels of inmate stress, and increased officer job satisfaction. These improved outcomes, however, only occur when everyone up the chain of command fully commits to positive organizational culture, and that commitment is sustained.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

Aggressive behavior can be the result of widely understood meteorological factors, such as temperature or atmospheric pressure. This is especially true for people with a high nervous system sensitivity, such as those with mental illnesses. Difficult behaviors might result in conflicts and, in the case of a psychiatric ward, an increased risk of coercive measures being employed. In turn, this might have a negative impact on the treatment process itself and therefore the quality of healthcare. The most frequently mentioned meteorological risk factors for aggressive and auto-aggressive behavior are air temperature and humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed. The seasonality of the impact of the weather (specific months or seasons) is also important. The weather can also synergistically affect the human body through the influence of different weather elements at the same time. However, meteorological factors should not be considered as the sole variable that causes aggressive behavior, for they affect both staff and patients. Therefore, they should be considered as one of the groups of elements that influence aggressive behavior.","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Emotion', 'Personality and Social Psychology']"

Due to their comparatively large cross-sections, they carry significant portion of the base bending moment and shear under lateral load. Analysis of shear walls requires incorporation of inelastic material models as often the stresses the elastic threshold under extreme lateral loading such as earthquake. On the other hand, analysis and design tools used for buildings often employ beam-type 1D finite element formulations for shear walls as well as beams and columns as such models are computationally faster which is especially important in nonlinear time-history analysis and the results are easier to interpret for design purposes. In 1D finite element formulations often uniaxial material models are used. In this study we have employed a multi-axial concrete model within a 1D finite element formulation so that effect of shear stresses can be considered in the material behaviour.

Kant’s reflective-teleological judgment is then declared the most advanced concept in his entire conceptual architectonic, on the grounds that it alone uniquely captures what we cannot but do when we are confronted with opaque aggregates of empirical phenomena. The chapter concludes with a justification for generalizing Kant’s reflective-teleological procedure as a proto-hermeneutic principle beyond its application to biological nature, an argument that is grounded in the comprehensive definition Kant provides of nature as the “sum of phenomena” in the third Critique and in particular in his assertion that human culture is to be viewed as the highest form of the development of nature.","['Philosophy', 'Continental Philosophy', 'Hermeneutics']"

Firstly, the composition of the electromechanical actuation system of large aircraft is analyzed and an accurate mathematical model of the electromechanical actuator with fault information of each component is established. Secondly, the homogeneous multi-agent model is established according to the information interaction among the redundant electromechanical actuators and the distributed relative output error vector is obtained. To minimize the estimation error, the gain matrix of the observer is solved by combining pole assignment and H-infinity performance multi-objective design method, and the design of fault diagnosis observer for redundant electromechanical actuation system is completed. Finally, combined with the flight quality requirements of large aircraft and the design of typical roll angle control mode control law, the signal threshold for fault diagnosis of the electromechanical actuation system is adaptively obtained from the influence of fault signal on the electromechanical actuator and the influence of electromechanical actuator performance parameters on the key state of the flight control system, which provides the judgment basis for fault isolation of electromechanical actuator.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

The existence of cracks would aggravate chloride ingress and reinforcement corrosion, especially for offshore engineering structures, thereby further weakening the structural performance and reducing their service life. The research on the chloride-induced corrosion of steel bars in pre-cracked concrete is fundamental. On this basis, this paper mainly reviews the studies from three perspectives: corrosion model of steel reinforcement in concrete, chloride ion transport in pre-cracked concrete under loading effects, and interaction between rebar corrosion and the concrete cover layer and tries to put forward the deficiencies and look forward to the research prospects.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Environment, general', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Water, general']"

This chapter will try to fill the gap, by analyzing first the internal political organization of the community, which is quite elaborate and codified, and has endured several changes in the four decades of life of the community. The second part of the analysis will be focused on the relations of the community with ‘external’ political institutions, especially at the local level. The chapter is based on first- and second-hand materials and studies, and interviews with present and past leaders of the community. The results show that the institutional system of Damanhur mixes several different logics of governance, trying to strike a balance between the charismatic and the participatory elements, and between the need for institutionalization and the capacity to reinvent and reshape its institutions and rules; while in its relations with the Italian institutions and political parties the Community has displayed a complex strategy based on both its own local political movement and different types of relations with national parties and elected representatives.","['Religious Studies', 'Spirituality', 'History of World War II and the Holocaust']"

Unfortunately, current methods require too much user involvement and fail to capture their true preferences. In fact, to avoid the nuisance of manually setting preferences, users usually accept the default settings even if these do not conform to their true preferences. Norms can be useful to regulate behaviour and ensure it adheres to user preferences but, while the literature has thoroughly studied norms, most proposals take a formal perspective. Indeed, while there has been some research on constructing norms to capture a user’s privacy preferences, these methods rely on domain knowledge which, in the case of AI technologies, is difficult to obtain and maintain. We argue that a new perspective is required when constructing norms, which is to exploit the large amount of preference information readily available from whole systems of users. Inspired by recommender systems, we believe that collaborative filtering can offer a suitable approach to identifying a user’s norm preferences without excessive user involvement.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The construction of a set of typical structures is reduced to solving a set of optimization problems, each representing a separate problem. The problem of transition between structures can be solved on the basis of fuzzy-logical inference tools with the construction of a fuzzy topological space model on a set of controls with new typical structures obtained from solutions to optimization problems. On the part of the scientific community the problem of synthesis of optimal systems is of great theoretical and practical interest, which is confirmed by a huge number of publications in this field. This is due to the fact that the application of governance in the form of synthesis provides the robustness of the system with respect to the parameters change, the action of various external and parametric perturbations, the differential switching points, the discrepancy of the chosen mathematical model with the actual dynamics of the processes, as well as allows to solve problems in real time. The specific problem within this general problem can be reduced to use of the condition for the maximum of the generalized power function as the basis for the quasi-optimal control synthesis.

The topology of the proposed and analyzed power stages is called “independent double-boost interleaved converter” (IDBIC) with three-level output. The working principle of the specified power stage topology was studied in the context of a renewable energy application which involved three copies of the same DC-DC converter with their outputs connected in series. The specified configuration scheme has been used as an interface between three independent PV panels and the deserved load. Every converter has been used to harvest energy from a single PV panel. The overall resultant power of the system represents the sum of the three converter’s output power. Each converter has been driven by its own control law based on the Maximum Power Point Tracking—Perturb and Observe technique. The main purpose of the described control law is to extract the maximum power from each PV panel at different solar irradiation levels. Several tests were performed using a MATLAB–Simulink and PLECS Blockset co-simulation model. The resultant current and voltage waveforms of each PV panel at different values of solar irradiation were represented and analyzed. Also, the efficiency of each power stage was determined using switching and conduction power losses provided by thermal models of the power switching elements being used within the study model.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Most importantly, it provides a starting place for those interested in learning about this type of analysis and considerations that users should be aware of. Those unfamiliar with exploratory data analysis may find the article helpful in understanding what will be covered during their dissertation process. Terrorism is a term we use to refer to violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims. Terrorism has been around for about two centuries, but it did not gain much traction until the 1970s. Terrorism is defined as violent acts against innocent people committed to making an impact on society or government. The underlying causes of terrorism are usually motivated by injustice, revenge, oppression, retaliation, conflict, and hostility borne out of inequality among countries. Furthermore, it is associated with religious extremism and usually targets civilian populations to cause death or destruction. As a result of these patterns in manifestation and potential consequences worldwide, terrorism has become a pressing global issue that requires attention at multilateral levels. In this article, we have tried to cover all the aspects of terrorist data analysis using various machine learning algorithms like support vector machine and linear regression. After analyzing the above datasets by the said model, we have figured out which region is mainly affected by attacks and where the cases of terrorists have been seen frequently. Here, we have tried to explain what it means to do this kind of research and provide some considerations for those who want to use this approach for their work.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security']"

This chapter scrutinizes the top academic performance attained by Taiwanese students by reviewing the national intended curriculum and guidelines, implemented teacher education and instruction, established textbook policies, and effects of national entrance examinations based on the Tri-Partite model. Intended curriculum defines what students should learn in schools at the country level; implemented curriculum refers to how and with what tools teachers instruct; attained curriculum is what students achieve. How the intended, implemented, and attained curricula interact to result in top performances for Taiwanese students among the education systems participating in international large-scale assessments is explained in detail. The traditional emphasis on the attained curriculum in Taiwan’s society seems to enhance Taiwanese students’ academic performance by ensuring they acquire basic skills and content knowledge in subject domains and related learning areas. Nonetheless, the need for modern citizens with high-level cognitive reasoning, autonomous problem-solving skills, modern digital learning abilities, and elevated well-being calls for advanced educational policies and practices in Taiwan. Investing educational resources in disadvantaged populations would ameliorate the serious achievement gap observed in Taiwan and thus strike a balance between equity and excellence. Along with the 12-Year Basic Education, Taiwan integrates the three parts of the curriculum to maintain its students’ top academic performance while aiming to reduce the achievement gap and improve educational equity. Concurrently, Taiwan helps students’ well-being by encouraging them to become modern citizens who take initiatives, engage in interaction, and seek the common good.","['Education', 'International and Comparative Education', 'Education, general']"

According to Vegard’s law, lattice constants undergo slight variations under various condensation conditions. When Born–Huang (BH) stability criteria were applied to determine elastic parameters, the calculated E g value of BAs 1− x N x decreased concerning the increase in As condensation. It was found that these elastic constant values easily fulfilled the BH stability criteria, mechanically stabilizing BAs 1− x N x . Moreover, the elastic moduli, Poisson's ratio and other properties were calculated. Our results suggest that BAs 1− x N x compounds are ideal candidates for utilization in the above devices. Additionally, the calculated optical properties of this alloy indicated that BAs 1−x N x is suitable for practical photo-sensing and photovoltaic applications due to its vast spectral region ranging from ultra-violet to visible, higher absorption peaks, and overall E g values.

Certain authors have highlighted how said financial support often leads to an increase in corruption and/or inequality, while others find no correlation whatsoever. In the same vein, the literature has also underlined how development aid provided by traditional donors has a higher chance of improving democratic openness than aid provided by emerging countries, which instead seems to be more effective in terms of economic development. Despite those relevant insights, the literature seems to have mostly set its focus on inquiries that explore the topic at either the global or the regional level. For those reasons, I opted to observe the above trends at the national level by analysing the impact of development aid in 15 OSCE recipient countries. In particular, I seek to either confirm or refute the literature’s notion that emerging countries’ contributions are expected to improve the recipients’ economies, although said achievements also come with higher corruption levels. At the same time, I also postulate that development aid coming from traditional donors is more likely to foster democratic progress. To fulfil both these goals, I rely on OECD and Aiddata data sets in order to track the aid flows from two traditional donors (the US and the EU) and two emerging providers (Russia and China) over the 2012–2019 period.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'International Security Studies', 'Terrorism and Political Violence', 'Political Science', 'Development Studies', 'Comparative Politics']"

Efficient management of these services relies on the quality of measurements of hydraulic variables in pipes and sewers to support robust analysis of systems’ performance, needed to many decision-making processes. The quality of measurements is key for the sustainability of urban water services, having a growing impact on decisions and on trade relations. Often, quantities of interest (e.g., flow rate, volume, level, and velocity), affecting net balances (e.g., inflow and outflow net balances, water losses, undue inflows and trade volumes) and used to support decision making, are obtained indirectly from a wide diversity of instrumentation, using different principles and methods. To reach acceptable accuracy, required for the measurement itself, and because of implications when used for management, three elements are critical: good measurement practices, traceability, and measurement uncertainty. Measurement uncertainty plays a relevant role today, to capture the random nature of measurement, and is considered the most reliable parameter able to provide information about the accuracy of measurement within a certain degree of confidence, allowing comparisons between instruments, practices, and methods.

Hence, a plus-minus ambivalence is introduced where a negative (cutout) allows for a positive (message). This yin and yang resonates in areas such as information design with airbrushed words and numbers as well as stencil art, ranging from political messages to abstract graffiti. With the advent of cost-efficient laser cutting for model making, cutout form templates – in contrast to stencil carriers – emerge in great numbers in dumpsters that can be considered illegible leftover waste (the cutout substance missing) or as off-cuts that spur imagination. We see visible and therefore substantial contour forms that are fundamentally empty in terms of the immateriality of the enclosed areas, oxymorons of ‘substantial’ omissions in 2D.

Once exposed in the cleaning process, these support structures reveal impressive 3D balances of geometric reasonability and visual arbitrariness.

Design/methodology/approach The research methodology is based on a primary analysis of regulatory documents and current publications on the development of economic systems and the “smart city” system, as well as the methods of mathematical information theory. On the basis of this approach, the basic concepts of the “smart city” concept were considered, and the analysis of specialized literature was carried out. Originality/value The significant differences in the views of various scientists on the concept of “smart city” are revealed. Contradictions of interests among different groups of stakeholders of the “smart city” (citizens, businessmen, scientists, managers, politicians) can significantly reduce the effectiveness of the solutions being developed. Currently, the degree of the development of the structures of the “smart city” is assessed by formal indicators presented in the standards and guidelines. Considering the “smart city” not only as a system but also as a product, it is necessary to study it from the point of view of the interests of its consumers (stakeholders). Consumers can assess the product quality. To assess the quality of a smart city product, it is necessary to develop a numerical criterion showing the satisfaction of stakeholders’ interests. It is shown that the criterion based on the mathematical apparatus of information theory and statistics “entropy” can be applied as an adequate, accurate, and reliable criterion. For this purpose, the relevant literature is considered, affirming the statements that this approach is universal. The developed criterion makes it possible, based on a sociological survey, to compare different stages of the city’s development and determine the presence of trends toward improving the quality of life when building a “smart city”. Some issues of the formation of a “smart city” in the example of Tula, Tula region, and the Russian Federation are considered. Conclusions It has been established that the main drawback is insufficient consideration of the opinion of the citizens, while the “smart city” should be considered as a product, which should be evaluated by the consumers—the citizens. For an objective assessment, an information criterion of the quality of a “smart city” and evaluation of the trends’ development was created.","['Business and Management', 'Business Strategy/Leadership', 'Management', 'Economic Growth', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Asian Economics', 'International Organization']"

Austria quickly introduced social-distancing measures, accompanied by generous financial programs to offset negative effects on the economy. Following established patterns of policy-making, government assumed the leading role, while corporatist actors were involved in the negotiation and implementation of the measures.

EU policy makers perceive SMEs internationalization as a desired path for global growth; thus, they have put forward certain tools which aim to boost the pace and scope of internationalization, i.e., by creating and facilitating access to support activities, sharing information, promoting cluster and networking initiatives, making support schemes consistent throughout the EU, etc. (Della Corte, Handbook of research on startegic Management in Small and Medium Enterprises. IGI Global, 2014). However, a vital point in creating a successful internationalization framework requires understanding that SMEs internationalization models may and do differ from those of multinational enterprises (MNEs). SMEs have a different structure, and they act differently, since their aims vary from those of MNEs (Knight and Liesch, Journal of World Business 51(1): 93–102, 2016; Buckley, Journal of World Business, 51(1): 74–82, 2016). Former studies of European SMEs indicate that there are specific traits of company characteristics that determine their internationalization process. Amongst the distinguished factors, size, activities performed, age, and experience counted as the most significant determinants of the expansion. However, these findings refer to occurrences dating back at least 5 years. In the era of rapid digitalization and—still—ongoing globalization, the impact of these factors might have diminished, making place for others. Therefore, the rising importance of digitalization calls for the need to identify new barriers and opportunities for SMEs to become international. The aim of this chapter is to see whether and how digitalization has influenced the internationalization models of Polish SMEs. We do not provide quantitative analysis that would allow us to statistically verify hypotheses on that matter; however, given the recent developments of the business world and internationalization trends, we assume that digitalization has had an impact on how companies expand abroad nowadays. The study has a screening aim and should allow us to determine whether, in the case of the Polish context, the matter requires further pursuit. The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows: first, we discuss the internationalization models which commonly referred to the international expansion of SMEs. Secondly, we discuss how digitalization can influence the process and its determinants. Finally, we present our research results based on quasi-focus group discussion with Polish SMEs. The study concerned the impact the digitalization has on the internationalization experience of those companies.","['Business and Management', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Environmental Policy', 'Corporate Environmental Management', 'Environmental Management']"

With regional networks, we attended Beijing plus 10 (B+10) in 2005 and successfully advocated for a UN Resolution on the response to women in disaster situations. The hard decision was then made to withdraw from our engagement with CSW and focus on UNHCR. UNHCR funded trials of the WaR Identification Tool in New Delhi, which challenged emerging wisdom that refugees were safer in urban environments. We then went to an African nation, where we uncovered serious malpractice and corruption, challenging our role as researchers. Starting in 2005, with the support of a large team of international advocates we fought for a ‘Conclusion on Women at Risk’ which was adopted in 2006. Refugee women contributed to the Conclusion and the Tool. UNHCR invited us to expand the Tool to cover other at-risk groups. It was trialled  in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh.

One of the most strained relationships in this story is between Fleur Pillager and Pauline Puyat, whose tumultuous friendship is often characterized by rivalry. Nevertheless, Fleur’s story, and Pauline’s presentation of it, elevates a model of female friendship inextricably connected to a larger communal vision for human and ecological flourishing. Although Fleur’s and Pauline’s friendship fails to develop into a close, mutually supportive relationship, Fleur’s kinship practices, expressed through her fidelity to land, tradition, and community, mark and influence Pauline so that she is continually haunted by the values she herself strives to reject. This form of friendship, rather than featuring intimacy between two individuals, emphasizes a collective neighborliness wherein each community member has a responsibility to care for and assist others. Fleur’s adherence to this form of friendship in her contact with Pauline inspires Pauline’s narrative, which suggests that female friendship rooted in kinship practices is strong enough to survive in the colonizer’s narrative. This friendship, in turn, contributes to the preservation and continuation of Native communities and their resistance to cultural genocide.","['Literature', 'North American Literature', 'Gender Studies', 'Fiction', 'Twentieth-Century Literature', 'Contemporary Literature']"

For proper identification of abnormalities (Retinal Diseases) present in an image, an adequate amount of image enhancement is required. The presence of any medical complications may lead to loss of eye vision, thus a diagnostic system is extremely required. Diabetic retinopathy is one of the majorly present medical complications that affect human vision. In this paper, the retinal image enhancement techniques using histogram equalization, adaptive histogram equalization, brightness preserving bi-histogram equalization, dual-tree complex wavelet transform, and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization techniques are discussed. For comparison of these techniques, parameters like mean square error, peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index metrics, absolute mean brightness error, and root mean square error are available. These parameters can help in an early-stage diagnosis of retinal complications.","['Engineering', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Energy Systems']"

Inclined dense jets are commonly used in discharge systems to enhance the mixing efficiency and minimize environmental impacts. Many studies focus on the inclined dense jet on a horizontal bottom, and they have provided plenty of valuable information on geometrical and mixing characteristics of inclined dense jet, which is important for outfall designs. Since the brine is usually denser than receiving water, it will eventually move along the seabed. This leads us to carry out this study about how mixing develops for the inclined dense jet on the bottom especially on a sloped one since the seabed always has the natural inclination. In the present study, the mixing of inclined dense jet on the sloped bottom is investigated by numerical simulations using the solver twoLiquidMixingFoam in OpenFOAM. A Reynolds Averaged Navier Strokes (RANS) turbulence models (Nonlinear k-ε) was chosen to perform the jet behavior analysis. Jets of inclination angle of 15° with four different initial conditions (Froude number = 10,15, 20, 25) on three different bed slope angles (0°, 3°and 6°) in stagnant water were studied. The results show that (1) the coefficients of the jet geometric characteristics have good agreement with previous studies; (2) After the impact point, the slope did enhance the dilution of the plume compared to the horizontal bed; (3) The dilution was thus affected by the slope and the dilution after the impact point on the slope appeared to be linearly related to the distance to the source;(4) The slope can approximately enhance the dilution up to 10% compared with the horizontal bed after the impact point. The present study can provide practical information for the design of desalination and industrial plants, especially for reducing the influence of the brine plume on the seabed and can lead research to focus on the bottom boundary condition at outfall systems.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

Taking thermoelectric transport as a typical case, we prove the form invariance of its temperature-dependent governing equations and formulate the corresponding transformation rules. Our finite-element simulations demonstrate robust thermoelectric cloaking, concentrating, and rotating performance in temperature-dependent backgrounds. We further design two practical applications with temperature-dependent transformation: an ambient-responsive cloak-concentrator thermoelectric device that can switch between cloaking and concentrating; an improved thermoelectric cloak with nearly-thermostat performance inside. Our theoretical frameworks and application designs may provide guidance for efficiently controlling temperature-related multiphysics and enlighten subsequent intelligent multiphysical metamaterial research.","['Physics', 'Optics, Lasers, Photonics, Optical Devices', 'Thermodynamics', 'Optical and Electronic Materials', 'Materials Science, general', 'Theoretical, Mathematical and Computational Physics', 'Condensed Matter Physics']"

The surprising success of a movie like Marty , focused on the life of a good-natured butcher who is looking for a wife (Academy Award for Best Film and Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival), may be interpreted as a sign that many, not only Italian Americans, could relate to the struggles of a character who is respectful with his family while, at the same time, is attempting to build his own life.

In particular, it is claimed, Hobbes’s redefinition of liberty as the absence of interference, subsequently taken up by Bentham and other utilitarian and liberal theorists, eclipsed the older republican notion in which the freedom of citizens was necessarily tied to the freedom of the state of which they were members. This liberal account of liberty is then contrasted with the more democratic republican account, in which political participation is intrinsically linked to freedom from mastery. However, the historiography of this claim proves problematic. On the one hand, it overlooks the prominent role played by utilitarian and liberal assumptions and principles in the democratic arguments of philosophic radicals in the nineteenth century. On the other hand, it involves excluding Rousseau and Kant, central figures in the continental republican tradition, from the republican canon because of the way they drew on Hobbes’ account of sovereignty to develop an argument for a democratic social contract. Both these historical developments suggest that the liberal account of freedom may be less inimical to democracy and republicanism than modern republican thinkers such as Pettit, have claimed. Indeed, we suggest the second may offer the basis of the most compelling defence of democracy understood in republican terms.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Political Theory', 'Political History', 'Political Science', 'Cultural History', 'Constitutional Law']"

The exercise of South Africans’ rights was severely constrained by instances of corruption like state control, extreme poverty, high unemployment, and violent crime. The quality and accessibility of these rights have also been undermined by restrictions and funding cuts for health and education services. The necessity to safeguard and advance civil and political liberties will guarantee that the state respects citizens’ rights and integrity, and it is up to it to take the necessary precautions to do so. While acknowledging the advancements made in the promotion and protection of civil and political rights, the African Peer Review Mechanism’s 2007 country report also noted that the apartheid era’s lasting legacy continued to be pervasive, leading to disparities, distortions, and social relations.

To cope with the issue that the real and dual parts of the twistor that represents the pose of a spacecraft are not in the same order, a scaled-twistor-based dynamic model is established for each spacecraft to avoid numerical difficulties in computation. On the basis of the scaled twistor model, a new distributed sliding surface is devised for the multi-agent system with a connected undirected communication graph. Then, a distributed control scheme is developed by combining the backstepping technique and sliding mode control theory under the assumption that the inertial parameters of the spacecraft and the upper bound of the external disturbances are known. To adapt to the uncertain inertial character of the spacecraft and external disturbances, adaptive laws are designed to estimate the inertial parameters and the upper bound of the disturbances to substitute for the corresponding assumed values in the controller. Finally, the stability of the whole closed-loop system is proved via Lyapunov stability theory. Numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

There is a need to investigate and promote the indigenous and emerging plant resources ( climate smart emerging crops ) which have been neglected by research, policy and decision-makers and consumers, but have the potential to contribute to food and nutrition security, income generation and combat the effects of climate change. This chapter discusses selected climate smart emerging crops : morama bean ( Tylosema esculentum (Burch.) A.Schreib.), mungongo ( Schinziophyton rautanenii (Schinz) Radcl.-Sm.), mosukujane ( Lippia javanica (Burm.f.) Spreng), moringa ( Moringa olifera Lam), Kgengwe ( Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai) and mahupu ( Kalaharituber pfeilii Trappe), with a focus on their unique chemical and medicinal properties, and explores how the indigenous communities have used them towards food security. To contextualize this, research projects that have been carried out in Botswana and Namibia are discussed and the lessons learned highlighted. The success of these projects has been dependent on symbiotic relationship, especially in terms of knowledge sharing, between researchers and communities where the plant species are abundant and used. These communities have demonstrated high levels of indigenous knowledge on conservation, sustainable collection, processing and utilization. It is within this context that appropriation of knowledge related to these climate smart emerging crops , through intellectual property protocols and guidelines, is found to be critical so that these communities can be protected and derive commercial benefits if any. Within the broad aim of promoting these climate smart emerging crops towards food security and food scarcity, there is a need for operational policy framework and strategy on domestication and cultivation of these that could lead to adequate research and development on domestication, cultivation and value chains to improve and promote the production, value adding and marketing of these species.","['Chemistry', 'Food Science', 'Agriculture']"

Global climate governance is also no longer restricted to multilateral negotiations under the UN Climate Convention: it increasingly extends beyond the international climate regime to climatize other areas of global politics. This concept of climatization points to a powerful but uneven process of extension, translation, and social coordination, as climate change becomes the frame of reference through which other policy issues and forms of global activism are mediated and hierarchized. This special issue brings together contributions on both theoretical aspects and empirical cases of the climatization process. The introduction sets out a conceptual framework to systematize these observations and guide further research. First, we identify the preconditions for, and driving forces behind, climatization. We then sketch the contours of an emergent ‘climate logic’ that reshapes affected domains, and examine the wider implications of climatization for global politics. Beyond the climate case, we hope this will provide new ways to observe and understand contemporary transformations of global society and global governance.","['Social Sciences', 'Environmental Policy', 'Political Science and International Relations, general', 'Political Theory', 'Governance and Government', 'International Environmental Law']"

This is underscored by the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) as essential to strengthening democracy and political governance in Africa. This chapter reviews the progress made by the Republic of South Africa since 2019 on the rights of vulnerable groups. It argues that practices and affirmative actions towards combatting prejudice or eliminating conditions that perpetuate discrimination against vulnerable and marginalised groups at both national and sub-national levels in South Africa have produced mixed results. These include challenges of designing and implementing policies and programmes of social inclusion that address the vulnerabilities of immigrant populations—asylum seekers, refugees, undocumented migrants and gender non-conforming people. Similarly, public and service delivery systems have not prioritised protective measures to secure their lives, properties and livelihoods against violence.

The proposed method is a two-stage switching scheme, consisting of a projection-based adaptive control allocation and a constrained optimisation-based control allocation. The proposed method switches control allocation algorithms from the adaptive control allocation to the optimisation-based control allocation when the actuator of the hexacopter is saturated. The switching criterion decides the switching timing so that the control allocation is robust for the delay of fault detection and isolation module. Numerical simulation demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively perform actuator-fault tolerant position control of the hexacopter without actuator saturation and consume less control effort compared with existing one-stage control allocation algorithms.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

The aim is to identify children and adolescents who meet full CD criteria and persistently and pervasively show two or more out of four criteria: (1) lack of remorse or guilt, (2) callous lack of empathy, (3) unconcerned about performance, and (4) shallow or deficient affect. The inclusion of the LPE specifier was based on a robust literature that enucleated a specific subgroup of CD children and adolescents characterized by severe maladaptive and antisocial behaviors and high developmental risk for adult antisocial personality disorder and global negative outcome. This subgroup of CD youths has been associated with the presence of specific temperamental traits, described primarily in adult psychopathy, named callous-unemotional (CU) traits, and characterized by reduced emotional responsiveness to others’ distress, low sensitivity to punishment cues, impairment in empathic concerns, and scarce capacity to generate prosocial attitudes. This chapter will describe the symptomatologic correlates and developmental trajectories of CU traits from childhood through adolescence to adulthood and will try to elucidate the international literature of the past 15 years’ contributions with respect to the identification of genetic, temperamental, and socio-environmental factors in the genesis of CU traits as well as with respect to their neurobiological and psychophysiological underpinnings. With the aim to facilitate the early identification of children and adolescents with CD and CU traits with preventive purposes, assessment strategies will be proposed, and validated assessment tools will be described in clinical and nonclinical populations, for different age groups and from various informants (self-reports, parents, teachers, clinicians). Finally, major therapeutic intervention models will be described that have shown evidence of effectiveness in CD with CU traits by reducing aggressive and antisocial behaviors and preventing negative outcomes.","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Emotion', 'Personality and Social Psychology']"

Decision-making was centered around the Prime Minister’s Office and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, and horizontal coordination created challenges. The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare was highly visible throughout the crisis, but occasionally the views of the health authorities and the government differed. After an initial seemingly passive phase, the government in mid-March 2020 declared a state of emergency and imposed strict anti-pandemic measures. The first wave of the pandemic was characterized by a sense of national urgency both in terms of policies and public opinion. Subsequently the government shifted to a decentralized, hybrid strategy under normal legislation, with targeted regional solutions favoured more instead of nation-wide measures. This produced occasional tensions between subnational authorities and the national executive while the confusing terminology of the authorities contributed to the increasing criticism of the government. However, overall, there was very little contestation of the adopted measures.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Comparative Politics']"

In recent years, the term FOIP (Free and Open Indo–Pacific) has been used as the philosophy of Japanese diplomacy. FOIP vision means to achieve peace, stability and prosperity in Asia and African region. Brazil itself is not a direct region for FOIP. But considering the African region is included in FOIP, and for Brazil, Africa is a continent historically and strategically important, Japan’s diplomatic concept, FOIP is not irrelevant to Brazil. To think about the future of Japan–Brazil relations, it is necessary to consider Japan’s African diplomacy in the era of FOIP in order to compare it with Brazil’s African diplomacy. In this article we will especially focus on the Portuguese-speaking African countries. The structure of the article is as follows. First, regarding Japan’s diplomacy with Africa, the philosophy and achievements of TICAD (Tokyo International Conference on African Development) started under the initiative of Japanese government since 1993 will be explained. In considering the future cooperation between Japan and Brazil in Africa, it is also necessary to understand Brazil’s African diplomacy. To that ends, the second part of the article will be the Brazilian diplomatic relations with Africa from the postwar period to the present day. In contrast to the active relations with Africa during the Lula governments, some major setbacks can be seen in the current Bolsonaro administration’s diplomatic relations with Africa. After the characteristics of Japan and Brazil’s diplomacy with Africa have been clarified, in the third part of this article, we will inquire the possibility of further cooperation of Japan and Brazil while looking back on the history and achievements of triangular cooperation between Japan–Brazil, and African countries, especially Mozambique.

Numerous academic works argue that the experience of integration (and migration) is qualitatively different for men and women. They conclude that gender plays a critical role in the pre-migration stage, in how men and women transition across state boundaries and, most significantly, in determining the way integration bureaucracies are experienced in host societies. Such studies demonstrate that the experience of integration is gendered and often to the detriment of women. But can the experience of women also be generalisable and reveal the foundational nature and logics of a host country’s integration regime? To answer this question, the chapter empirically focuses on the biographical accounts of female migrants in Denmark and their experiences of labour market integration (LMI). Since most holders of family reunification visas in Denmark are women, their experiences confirm the extant literature’s claim that migration is a gendered process. In addition, we argue that the nature of their experiences of LMI in Denmark also reflects the foundational character of the Danish integration regime. The biographical accounts of our female narrators are analysed through the scope of turning points – as path-altering events – in their integration narratives and associated epiphanies, that is, revelations or apprehensions triggered by turning points.","['Social Sciences', 'Migration', 'Labor Economics', 'Sociology of Work']"

This work aims to study the stability in the milling process through numerical measurements of cutting forces, in order to establish a stability lobe using Abaqus software, for half-immersion up-milling. The stability lobe found numerically was compared to a reference stability lobe from literature. The Johnson-Cook laws of behavior and damage are used for the workpiece, and an explicit scheme and a Lagrangian formulation are adopted. A minimum chip setting which ensures the initiation of the material removal is introduced based on numerical measurements, and experimental results from literature. The simulations are made for a single tooth and a single pass. Three states of stability are identified, by measuring numerically the cutting forces, for some cutting speeds: stable cut, unstable cut, and stability limit cut. Thus, we were able to establish numerically a stability lobe, linking the cutting speed to the cut depth. The obtained numerical stability lobe is not too different from the one of reference, yielding to conclude that the used numerical approach can predict the cutting stability accurately.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Materials Engineering', 'Classical and Continuum Physics']"

The last 10 years have seen substantial growth in devices that can be integrated into clinical care. Driven by the availability of reliable systems for continuous glucose monitoring, we have entered an era in which insulin delivery through insulin pumps can be modulated based on sensor glucose data. Over the past few years, regulatory approval of the first automated insulin delivery (AID) systems has been granted, and these systems have been adopted into clinical care. Additionally, a community of people living with type 1 diabetes has created its own systems using a do-it-yourself approach by using products commercialised for independent use. With several AID systems in development, some of which are anticipated to be granted regulatory approval in the near future, the joint Diabetes Technology Working Group of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes and the American Diabetes Association has created this consensus report.

We suggest a definition of engineering as practice, with its own virtues and internal goods, guided by a common good. A complementary function of engineering is also proposed, analogous to the translation between the objective lawfulness uncovered by theoretical sciences and the social lifeworld, through the materialization of truth in processes and commodities. These definitions make it possible to consider an ethical framework for the practice of engineering, which goes back to the Humboldtian maxim of transforming knowledge into deeds, that is, the question of how to convert the universality of facts into the particularism of values. Engineering ethics should not be confused with just another professional ethics, guided only by the internal regulations of the profession and by ethical standards and codes. On the other hand, it must not turn engineers into new moral heroes, the only social players responsible for solving dilemmas and ethical issues that arise with the massive arrival of technologies. Engineering should be understood as a collective practice of translation, creation and cooperation of alternative designs.

If two bodies collide and the time of the collision process is very short, then we observe a continuous change in the velocity of the body, and because the collision usually lasts for a very short time, it is associated with the generation of relatively large forces.","['Physics', 'Classical Mechanics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Complexity', 'Classical and Continuum Physics', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Engineering Design']"

We first unify these two basic heat transfer modes by coining a complex thermal conductivity whose real and imaginary parts are related to conduction and advection. Consequently, the conduction-advection process supporting thermal waves is described by a complex conduction equation, thus called complex thermotics. We then propose the principle for transforming complex thermal conductivities. We further design three metamaterials to control thermal waves with cloaking, concentrating, and rotating functions. Experimental suggestions are also provided based on porous media.","['Physics', 'Optics, Lasers, Photonics, Optical Devices', 'Thermodynamics', 'Optical and Electronic Materials', 'Materials Science, general', 'Theoretical, Mathematical and Computational Physics', 'Condensed Matter Physics']"

The nineteenth century is a fascinating, matrix-like observatory of the conflicts caused by certain visual signs, distinct from the traditional religious quarrel of images. Iconoclasm was deployed in fluid conjunctures—revolutions, restorations and political crises—during which sovereignty appeared to be up for grabs. It was very political. Tearing off a cockade, destroying a flag, knocking down a statue, slashing a painting: these acts grew much more frequent at the beginning of the Restoration (1814–1816), then in the wake of the Revolution of 1830 and that of 1848, but also in the terrible year of 1870–1871. Reasons other than political instability explain the persistence of iconoclasm during the nineteenth century. Visual communication was as important as the power of the written word. The first half of the nineteenth century was a time when belief in the performative power of images remained very strong; some iconoclasts still believed that acting on images would influence the course of history.","['History', 'Social History', 'Political History', 'European History', 'Modern History', 'World History, Global and Transnational History']"

For decades, industrial robotics have been enabling quality enhancement of end-products by using flexible manufacturing processes, without much concern to energy cost, but now a makeover is happening. Calls for sustainable and green manufacturing processes are being promoted across the globe with the aim to produce more goods and with less consumption. In this paper, a new method is presented focusing on the optimization of energy intake by industrial robots, without the need to change their hardware set and just modifying the trajectory planning of the end-effector. A test case scenario consisting of a robotic cell with 4 pick-and-place manipulators has been set to validate the method. Starting from a pre-scheduled trajectory, robots are moved at the highest speed and acceleration and, by performing the sequenced operations, the optimal trajectories are defined. The goal is to find a trajectory that minimizes the time cycle and the total energy consumption, while avoiding collisions between the robots’ links: comparing the results thereof to those of the pre-scheduled trajectory, noticeable energy saving has been obtained along with possible decrease of the cycle time.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Computer-Aided Engineering (CAD, CAE) and Design']"

Co-production of knowledge is a cognitive and social process. Trust is at the heart of this but is an underexplored topic in integrative research. This chapter explores how scientific integration is related to trust and suggests a dynamic trust perspective as an analytical platform. Co-production of knowledge presupposes constructing trust in the other’s scientific paradigm. Becoming a scientist is to internalise a paradigm for interpreting knowledge, establish a frame of reference, and use a repertoire of taken-for-granted truths. Interdisciplinary work implies interaction between different scientific paradigms and taken-for-granted truths. Effective interdisciplinary work must be based on trust; to do that trust building, processes have to be considered. Trust is a process; created, violated, and maintained through social interaction. To trust is to decide to make a leap of faith and surrender one’s vulnerability to the trustee. The leap of faith is triggered by an anticipated tacit social contract that there is a mutual understanding between trustor and trustee. The key to trusting is to develop an acceptable level of mutual understanding and act accordingly.","['Business and Management', 'Sustainability Management', 'Economic Geography', 'Diversity Management/Women in Business', 'Law and Economics', 'Business Ethics']"

Recent research has identified various causes and possible solutions to the problem. However, most scholars have considered a reductionist approach, in which the ability of computer configurations to prevent unwanted intrusions is evaluated by breaking them down to their constituent parts. This method is inadequate at studying complex adaptive systems. Therefore, the proposed project is designed to utilize a holistic stance to assess the cybersecurity management and policies in Saudi Arabian universities. Qualitative research, entailing a thorough critical review of ten public universities, will be utilized to investigate the subject matter.

It is determined by the fact that with the spontaneous formation of the studied samples, for example, in social research, a kind of “bias” occurs, determined by the motivation of the respondents. This principle can also be manifested in the formation of public opinion on socially significant issues: during elections, referendums, etc. Moreover, knowledge of the principle of “bias” can be used to organize a deliberate “bias” of the results of socially significant surveys. Using general scientific methods of analysis and synthesis, the paper shows possible approaches to the formation of such “bias”, analyzes the possible consequences of the implementation of such technologies, and formulates proposals to counteract them. The conclusion is made that the purposeful use of technologies of “bias” assessment can lead to the emergence of conflicts of interests of different groups of society and government, but the situation so far could not be corrected due to the lack of appropriate countermeasures. The development of mechanisms for assessing the consequences of “bias” and countering it, in theory, can provide greater resilience to society and make it difficult to use external influences to destabilize the state in the event of deliberate use of the “bias”.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

The explicit integration scheme with automatic and adaptive sub-stepping is employed to increase the speed of finite element simulations.

It defines onward migration as a migration trajectory that involves extended stays in two or more destination countries and distinguishes it from competing and overlapping terms like stepwise and transit migration. Onward migration is a growing phenomenon within overall global migration dynamics, although statistics to document the scale and trends of this type of migration are scarce. The main aim of the chapter is to examine how onward migration and transnationalism are connected. This is achieved both by reference to a range of existing literature and by citing evidence from the succeeding chapters in the volume. We demonstrate both how transnationalism can shape onward migration and, the reverse, how different onward migration trajectories may result in different forms of transnationalism. In this latter context, we identify inter-generational, split, widening and re-routed transnationalism, again drawing on examples both from the book and from the wider literature. The final section of the chapter consists of a methodological discussion on the practicalities of researching onward migration and multi-sited transnationalism, in which the technique of multi-sited ethnography is discussed, critiqued and modified.","['Social Sciences', 'Migration', 'Public Policy']"

The potentials are wide-ranging and include applications in diagnostics and therapy, as well as the development of pharmaceuticals. But what challenges are associated with the use of AI in healthcare? Within the framework of a qualitative empirical study according to Mayring, this question has been investigated. Based on a systematic literature review, the following barriers of AI in healthcare have been identified and examined: Disagreement in data protection, lack of compatibility with ethical aspects, quality of training data, knowledge, and trust of physicians in AI-supported systems. The next step in the research design have been expert interviews among medical staff as well as AI developers with focus on AI in the healthcare sector mainly in Germany. According to these interviews, the data are analyzed and evaluated. Based on the results of the study, potential activities have been derived in order to be able to successfully overcome the barriers of AI in the healthcare sector in the future.

However, major social and economic changes in the United States over the last several decades have had profound impacts on the economic and social well-being of men of lower socioeconomic status (SES) and men of color, specifically Black, Latino, and Indigenous men. These changes have created stark disparities in the ability and capacity of fathers to be involved with their children. Social policies can be effective mechanisms for promoting and ensuring the well-being of fathers, but fathers are rarely the explicit target of policy efforts. Child support enforcement, the only national policy targeting fathers, has produced an inequitable system that disproportionately subjects low-SES fathers and fathers of color to a series of punitive enforcement mechanisms with minimal benefit to children. We provide evidence for the potential of a broad swath of social policies that have not traditionally been targeted at fathers to improve the well-being of fathers and facilitate their engagement with children. We propose that social workers are uniquely positioned to advocate for reforms and expansions to these policies that will improve father, child, and family well-being and promote economic, social, and racial justice.","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Ethics and Values in Social Work', 'Sociology of Family, Youth and Aging', 'Psychotherapy and Counseling']"

A large experimental program was performed to characterize the mechanical properties and the kinetics of the AAR chemical reaction for the original mass concrete used in the construction of the facility (maximum aggregate size of 76 mm). The importance of considering mechanical and chemical size effects is discussed, on the basis of the asymptotic fracture energy and the free AAR expansion curve. The developed phenomenological hygro-chemo-mechanical approach for AAR modelling in mass concrete hydraulic structures is presented. The efficient and yet simple approach is based on three analyzes: transient thermal analysis, transient hygral analysis, and final multi-physical analysis that includes mechanical loading. The modelling approach was validated with existing benchmarks from the literature and provided very promising results, despite the simplifications made and the assumptions for some uncertain input parameters. Application of the numerical modelling approach to the existing hydraulic facility demonstrated its feasibility in an industrial context. It also provided fairly similar damage pattern if compared to the existing cracking pattern and improved the understanding of the complex structural behaviour of the facility. Comparison of displacement model predictions and available monitoring data allowed to assess an important size effect between laboratory and in-situ expansions.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Structural Materials', 'Sustainable Development', 'Mathematical Modeling and Industrial Mathematics']"

In the years following Mussolini’s rise to power, this was not only Gramsci’s belief. On the contrary, in several authors, close to or far from him, we find a similar historicist call for an organic analysis capable of explaining more thoroughly and satisfactorily the collapse of the Italian liberal regime.

The optimal diagram was presented according to the criterion of the maximum speed for the lifting mechanism. Also, the optimal movement diagram was presented under restrictions on the loss number of the lifting mechanism components. A generalized structural diagram has been synthesized, which makes it possible to analyze nonlinear oscillatory lift systems, as objects of regulation, with arbitrary parameters of the lifting mechanisms and arbitrary laws of their control. Recommendations are proposed for improving the quality of the dynamic modes of lifting mechanisms due to vibration damping. The solution of minimizing the vertical vibrations of the elements of lifting mechanisms arising in dynamic modes by forming the required mechanical characteristics of the engine with specific rigidity parameters is considered. Dependencies of the damping coefficient of the equivalent vibrational link on the rigidity of the mechanical characteristics, the recommended values of the rigidity of the mechanical characteristics on the values of the mass ratio, and the maximum value of the damping coefficient on the mass ratio are given. It is shown that the choice of the required rigidity of the mechanical characteristics of the electric motor of the lifting mechanism increases the damping coefficient and reduces the oscillation in transient modes.","['Engineering', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Engineering Design', 'Materials Engineering']"

All cybersecurity work descriptions were ranked in terms of proneness for automation according to four criteria: requirements for creativity, social interaction, physical work, and the existence of relevant statistical training data. It was found that technical roles, for example database administrators and data analysts, are easiest to automate. Roles associated with management and accountability, for example, legal advisors and cyber operations planners, are more difficult to automate.

Through the investigation and analyses performed on Malaysian organizations’ online privacy policies, this study reveals several trends using text processing and clustering analysis methods: (1) the use of jargon in privacy policies are relatively low, (2) privacy policies with higher compliance levels tend to be lengthier and more repetitive, and vice versa, (3) regardless of compliance level, there are privacy policies that are not presented in user-friendly font size. Finally, as an experiment of applying the developed metrics, the results confirm the relevance of the assessment metrics developed for assessing online privacy policies via text processing and clustering analysis.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The feats of human creativity and innovation provide our conspecifics too much to marvel at and feel proud of what human civilization has achieved in the course of its evolution down the ages. However, despite all our technological sophistications, we have failed to achieve this glory without compromising the ecological balance of nature. The ecological fallout of anthropogenic activities makes us ponder over the drawbacks inherent in man-made technologies. From this perspective, insects emerge as serious competitors to man because their intriguing evolutionary history is a unique success story which saw their domination in all habitats and resulted in their unprecedented diversity without disturbing the environment and its delicate balance. This is such a remarkable thing that tempts us to learn a lot from insects and come up with novel, environment-friendly, and more efficient technologies. Many branches of life sciences such as genetics, molecular biology, developmental biology, and chronobiology have benefitted so much from the studies on insects that insect models have become indispensable for their growth. Interestingly, insects have been an inspiration behind many of the technological advancements of our contemporary world. The fields of aviation and architecture owe a lot to insects for some of the bizarre designs and out-of-box ideas. Over the past few decades, there has been a significant rise in the application of insects for achieving technological breakthroughs. Materials science is coming forward as a major beneficiary of insect-derived substances with interesting properties which find application in various industries and are appearing in a large variety of useful products. Further, the movement patterns of insects are leading to innovations in robotics and prosthesis. The present review takes a closer look at the uses of insects in the growth of science and technology. It gives a bird-eye-view of the major developments in insect-inspired breakthroughs in basic sciences and their applications in technology and is expected to grab the attention of entomologists and technocrats alike. Given the rapid pace at which this subject is growing today, it is quite likely that it will soon find a prominent place in mainstream entomology syllabi.","['Life Sciences', 'Zoology']"

By and large, any business’ CSR initiatives in whatever forms and shapes would positively contribute to the triple-bottom-line of business, namely profit, people and planet. Apart from looking after its employees, engaging local community is inevitably included under the people bottom line. Malaysian Palm Oil Companies over the last three decades have expanded their activities in Indonesia to gain competitive edges by tapping attractive land’s price and relatively cheaper labour resources. Notwithstanding of socio-economic contribution of Malaysian Palm Oil Companies in their host country through job opportunities, improvement in infrastructure as well as economic gains by Indonesian government through tax payment, not much has been studied about their benefits to local communities who live within the vicinity of the palm oil plantations. Against this academic lacuna, this study aims to investigate level of engagement of Malaysian Palm Oil Companies in Indonesia with local communities by using six companies as the case study. Utilising on qualitative method where interviews were conducted with the community leaders and palm oil companies’ management in various provinces in Sumatra and Kalimantan. The results of the study found that majority of those companies hardly engage with their local communities. These findings are instructive where Malaysia Palm Oil Company needs to proactively embrace and engage community engagement through a deeper, meaningful and continuous collaboration the local communities in order to gain minds and hearts of their existence which in turns can contribute to the sustainability of their companies and also the palm oil industry .","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

In the former, short-term, market-based, money-dealing capital focused on trading fictitious capital in a parasitical relation with industrial capital. In the latter, the relation between banks and industry reflected the maturity of capital in its monopoly phase. While banks dominated, engineered the productive expansion of industrial capital. Furthermore, this chapter argues that both Marx and Hilferding expected the English model to be superseded by the more productive model of finance capital as a prelude to socialism, an expectation that has not so far been fulfilled. The United States’ desire, only partially fulfilled after World War II, to emulate British financial dominance gave the British pattern a longer lease on life.

Institutions Maintained by Minority Self-Governments in Hungary",OriginalPaper,"In the history of national cultural autonomy (NCA) in Hungary, the emphasis since the mid-2000s has been placed on institutionalisation, with the aim of establishing, or taking over and maintaining various cultural and educational institutions with appropriate budget support by the minority self-governments (MSGs), the local variants of NCA. However, in practice this remained mostly on paper in the 1990s. But now there are hundreds of institutions—kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, dormitories, museums, libraries, theatres, research institutes, etc.—that are run by minorities. In this way, MSGs have become main actors in implementing linguistic, cultural and educational minority rights in the country. This is all the more important because recent experiences have shown that the transmission of minority languages ​​and identities in families is now largely interrupted, and minority educational institutions have an increasingly important role to play. However, this has been somewhat controversial, and still characterises minorities to varying extents, with those previously recognised in the communist era remaining in better positions with their pre-existing networks of institutions. It has only been possible for the establishment of these institutions, recognised later under the 1993 Minority Act, to begin in the last two decades. In some places, the idea of MSGs taking over existing institutions met resistance from the local populations, especially parents. In other places, especially during the Orbán governments in the 2010s, such a takeover became a kind of escape route so that the school in the municipality would neither be closed, nor continue to be maintained by the state or the churches. It has also been a question of how these minority schools perform on a variety of indicators, and thus whether it is worthwhile for parents to enrol their children. In addition, some ‘institutions’, especially certain ‘research centres’ employing only one person, cannot be considered real institutions. To address the issues above, the major aim of the study is to introduce and analyse the complex process of institutionalisation, and to summarise and evaluate its experiences, especially with regard to the impact of these institutions on the linguistic, cultural and educational rights of minorities.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Comparative Politics', 'Language Policy and Planning', 'Governance and Government', 'Political Science']"

However, the turbulent environmental airflow in the high-rise building area and the complex wind field pose a threat to the stability of fire fighting and fire fighting drones, which puts forward higher requirements for the stability and wind resistance of multi-rotor UAV flight platforms. Therefore, aiming at multi-rotor drones that perform fire fighting tasks in high-rise buildings, the characteristics of wind fields between buildings in high-rise buildings are studied to provide technical references for the design and optimization of fire-fighting drones, which not only has important theoretical significance, but also has high practical value. With multi-rotor firefighting drones as the background, based on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) theory and Fluent software, the wind field characteristics around high-rise buildings are studied, carrying out numerical simulation analysis of the wind field around single buildings and multiple buildings to provide a reference for the actual flight of fire extinguishing drones between buildings. The analysis results show that: Compared to the single building, the wind field around the building has changed a lot when the two buildings are arranged, and the aerodynamic interference between the two buildings is significantly weakened as the distance between the buildings increases; Layout and the surrounding buildings play a shielding role. The wind and shadow areas are superimposed on each other, and the air flow is complicated. Drones should avoid flying in these complex wind fields as for as possible.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

The research analyses the implications of coronavirus COVID-19 for UK Construction small and medium size enterprises (CoSMEs) in terms of their resilience using secondary data and information from articles and public data. Findings from the research reveal that small and medium size construction firms in the UK were adversely affected by the pandemic with many going into liquidation. The impact of government interventional measures varied across the various subsectors, overall, the measures were deemed inadequate and implemented rather late to stop many CoSMEs from insolvency. Additionally, most CoSMEs that operate largely on self-employed basis could not immediately take advantage of these measures. Mostly, it was the large construction firms that took advantage of government schemes and survived. The government concentrated on the huge and indivisible capital projects which offered a soft landing for many big construction firms, benefitting the upper end CoSMEs.

Such applications mandate the append-only nature of the data storage to support analytics and trust. Immutability is also the underlying premise of popular cloud native storage systems. This paper explores blockchain technology as a solution for privacy and disclosure compliance in stored healthcare data. Blockchain as a data structure is primed to store only small amounts of data to maintain the properties of immutability, tamper proofing, security, and transparency in applications and is not suitable for storing big data. However, healthcare blockchain implementations have several possibilities for storage management, and the paper presents a comparative analysis of the aggregation-based storage with IoT-based streaming e-healthcare application data for the use case. The in-depth analysis for the potential blockchain storage in the paper includes the cost factors, in addition to immutability and privacy preservation, and the results show that costs may be saved up to an order of magnitude 300 with aggregation.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

The forecasting of business processes in AIC is mainly represented by the individual models referring to informal expert reasoning. Global promotion processes for digital technologies in all economic areas require the creation of specialized systems of decision support based on the formalized forecasting models. This paper provides new approaches to forecasting socio-economic and climatic processes and/or systems in the context of strategic planning of AIC sustainable development. The analysis of dynamic specific characteristics of socio-economic and natural-climatic processes and/or systems has been implemented. The methods of probability theory, mathematical statistics and nonlinear dynamics (fractal analysis) were implemented for strategic planning of sustainable development of the AIC enterprises and the agriculture industry in general. Data mass analysis according to the key indicators of socio-economic and climatic processes and/or systems provided a conclusion about the presence of a “memory effect” in their dynamics. This fact makes it possible to form an adequate strategy of business processes and minimize the negative consequences of unfavorable events.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Data Engineering']"

In South Africa the backlog stems from previous discriminatory regimes and increasing urbanization. The housing backlog in South Africa has increased significantly and most especially in Cape Town. Housing is seen as a measure to transform and unify the segregated population. Project Leaders (PLs) are saddled with the responsibility of housing delivery and managing diverse stakeholders. Although project management is the driving force behind housing delivery, the project process is not free from dynamics. These housing projects constantly attract social and political attention, resulting in the PL repetitively contending with the inherited social and political dynamics of the Human Settlement Environment (HSE). The numerous challenges facing the PL created by the dynamism and ensuing complexity is unknown. Therefore, this research examines the challenges faced by PLs in the HSE and whether PLs exercise a capacity to transform, maintain, and lead the project organization creatively. A qualitative research approach with inductive-philosophical reasoning that employs interviews for data collection was chosen for the study. A sample of 19 PLs working in the public sector of human settlements in Cape Town was purposefully selected to participate in the study. The collected data were analyzed using thematic analysis to identify appropriate themes. The results identified six challenges: Social, Political, Organizational, Legislative challenges, Multi-stakeholder, and Skills faced by PLs. Following these themes, two key issues showed that social and political influence were the dominant factors affecting the implementation of housing projects. The research found that PLs do not have the authority in housing delivery. This limits the PL's ability to transform, maintain and lead the project organization creatively.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Sustainable Development', 'Construction Management']"

They may, however, fail to capture the inherent multi-sitedness of many displaced people’s everyday lives and their translocal connections across the globe. This chapter presents the role of family- and kin-network figurations in mobilities for Syrian refugees in Jordan. As part of the EU-funded Horizon 2020 project ‘Transnational Figurations of Displacement’ (TRAFIG), the chapter asserts that a key prospect for getting out of protracted displacement is the role of figurations, including family- and kin-based networks. Inspired by figurational sociology, the chapter seeks to highlight how ambiguous and uncertain family and kin networks are experienced by Syrian refugees in these ‘translocal figurations of displacement’ and how they impact on their mobility. Utilising 23 interviews – 6 males and 17 females aged between 20 and 49 – we examine the ways in which figurational networks of family and kin shaped and reshape refugees’ experiences with and desires for mobility both into and within Jordan and their aspirations beyond Jordan. In particular, we find that family and kin networks provide key socio-cultural structures and figurational contours to the mobilities experienced by Syrians through (1) knowledge-sharing and (2) trust-based interactions. We pay careful attention to the idea that future mobility is as much about imaginations and aspirations that reflect the family- and kin-network figurations, which may or may not be grounded in the real possibilities for mobility.","['Social Sciences', 'Migration', 'Public Policy']"

However, the patients’ data are deficient, especially for patients with chronic diseases and their previous medical treatments and diagnosis if they must be treated in other institutions outside of the country of leaving or private institutions. All data for patients are stored in the institutional database as electronic health data (EHR), owned by healthcare institutions, hospitals, and medical practitioners. It is almost impossible to integrate such data because of the different low treatment of personal health data, especially when the patients are from different countries. One solution for providing evidence-based health care and medicine is creating a personal health record (PHR) owned and managed securely by the patient as a central point of the PHR data-driven integration of all data connected with the patient that are mostly heterogeneous. All data types for the patient’s health and medical condition can be integrated into cloud-based PHR owned and managed by the patient to provide their data with them where the patient resides. In addition, the lack of information on genetic disorders of patients of which they are not aware can contribute to an increase in the risk of patient death. This fact also leads to the need to integrate medical and health data with various biological and omics data, especially in pandemic circumstances. Although the urgent need for health care and medical data integration is apparent, personal data protection laws are rigorous. They do not allow much progress in the field without implementing healthcare data security and privacy standards. The proposed solution for this issue is establishing a personal health record as an integrative system for the patient applying HL7 (FHIR) standards. The well-known medical codding systems promise future data integrations. In addition, some attempts are made to associate diseases with data obtained from external environmental sensors that measure disease-related data. Using these data, called exposure data or exposome, one can clarify the increasing symptoms of diseases influenced by external factors. In the paper, we highlight a cloud-based system—a model of PHR-based health care that collects different data sources such as EHR, health information systems, and sensor measurement into the PHR. Medical data, PHR, numerous biological and exposome data, and data obtained from sensors, are considered, stored, and managed on the cloud.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Statistics, general', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

The chapter concludes with two major criticisms, Gadamer’s failure to distinguish between Kant’s species subject and Romantic subjectivity and his neglect of Kant’s final critical concept of reflective-teleological judgment. In the remainder of the book, the latter is argued to be a major root of modern hermeneutics from Ast and Schleiermacher to their poststructuralist and postmodern successors.","['Philosophy', 'Continental Philosophy', 'Hermeneutics']"

The application of electrochemical promotion of catalysis (EPOC), especially that achieved through alkaline conductors (alkaline-EPOC), has been found to be extremely effective in ECC-related reaction systems. Its use made it possible to decipher the role and mode of action of alkaline promoters on these reactions, thus enabling the successful transfer of the obtained knowledge to the design of highly effective and simple, alkaline-promoted conventional catalyst formulations (alkaline-CPC), readily applicable in exhaust gas systems. Catalytic performance improvements by up to two orders of magnitude have been achieved on representative ECC-related reactions (e.g., deNO x ) via alkaline-EPOC and/or alkaline-CPC application. This chapter summarizes and critically discusses the literature findings on the topic.","['Chemistry', 'Catalysis', 'Electrochemistry', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering', 'Materials Science, general']"

As in many countries, also in Finland, the emergence of current counter media sites is closely connected to the rise of the anti-immigration movement, and immigration policies and immigrants have been targets of the massive social media disinformation and misinformation campaigns. By employing a nationally representative survey (N = 3724) from Finland, this study investigates how three social-media-related concerns addressing misinformation and disinformation are explained by political party preferences, media trust, and immigration attitudes. We found that the supporters of the populist party, the Finns, had more critical views on freedom of expression and monitoring of hateful content on social media. Moreover, they were less concerned with the flow of fake news on social media. Based on mediation analysis, we found that trust in traditional media and attitudes on immigration are lowest among the supporters of the Finns, which also explained their different views on fake news, freedom of expression and hateful content monitoring. Even though the independent variables were highly inter-correlated, they also associated individually with social media users’ perceptions. We argue that the accumulation of negative immigration attitudes and low trust in the media is reflecting attitudes towards social media among the supporters of populist parties. The results underline the populist right-wing communication strategy, which questions the reliability of mainstream media, undermines professional journalism, criticises political correctness, and appeals to those who are most frustrated with mainstream media and critical towards immigration.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Political Sociology', 'Political Communication']"

As was expected, this led to tremendous hardship for a large swathe of the country’s population. Amid all this, the education sector in India was unduly affected in several ways. Now, nearly a year on, there is still no clarity on when educational Educational Life institutions will be able to open and function “normally”. This paper delves into various aspects related to the way COVID-19 Covid 19 lockdowns affected the education sector in India, universities especially. Offering a multiplicity of perspectives, the objective of the paper is to provide a balanced viewpoint on the way several dynamics of the COVID-19 lockdown in India panned out, especially the challenges that it presented to Indian universities. Following the methodology of interpretivism research philosophy, the paper relies primarily on secondary—yet credible sources of data for providing its perspectives. These especially include a multiplicity of online news sites and other publications that have been gleaned over extensively before providing pertinent information. Additionally, social media sites have also been tapped widely for this paper. While perspectives on such sites are frequently opinionated and subjective, a plethora of them when taken in tandem work towards providing a holistic set of beliefs centred around the primary theme of this paper. For data analysis, a thematic analysis has been used for identifying consistent themes gleaned from secondary data that has been obtained as described above. The findings of the paper point towards significant challenges faced by all stakeholders Stakeholder Power in Indian universities, with no clear resolution in sight, in the immediate future. As the ongoing vaccination drive intensifies, the challenges faced by these universities are likely to resolve gradually, over a prolonged period.","['Business and Management', 'Business and Management, general', 'Business Ethics', 'Sustainable Development', 'Corporate Governance']"

A set of simplified models is used to formulate general and intuitive control laws, which are then applied in real-time for estimating and regulating the center of mass position and orientation of the multibody’s principal axes of inertia. The combination of proposed algorithms produces a stretched-leg gait with naturally looking upper body motions. As only a 6-axis IMU and joint encoders are necessary for the implementation, the portability between robots is high.

Firstly, the synchronous control objective of multiple ARVs is constructed using the cross-coupling synchronization control (CCSC) strategy and formation constraint. Then, to better deal with external time-varying disturbances, minimize the chatter from the controller and implement the synchronization control goal of multi-ARV systems, a robust synchronization controller for multi-ARV systems is developed, which combines high-order sliding mode control (HOSMC) and CCSC.

Firstly, the constant velocity (CV) model and the Singer model are involved to approximate the unknown kinetic characteristic of the non-cooperative target. Secondly, the network positioning is carried out by multiple passive sensors deployed in different areas on the ground, and a centralized observation equation is established. Then, the registration error of each sensor is extended to the target state vector considering its influence on the positioning accuracy, and a unified state space model is built up. Finally, the interacting multiple model (IMM) algorithm based on the square root cubature Kalman filter (SRCKF) filter is devised to realize the estimation of the target state as well as the registration error. Numerical simulations indicate that the presented algorithm can achieve the joint estimation of the target state and the sensor registration error in real time with high accuracy.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics']"

Such a force may be implemented by piezoelectric actuators. The intervals of constancy of this normal force are equal in length, and the force value on each of these sections is considered as an independent control input. We study the longitudinal motions of the rod and the means of control optimization. Based on the eigenmode decomposition, it is shown in the case of uniform rod that the original continuous system is split into several infinite vibrating subsystems each of which is controlled by a certain linearly independent combination of control inputs. It follows that if any of these combinations is taken equal to zero, then the corresponding subsystem becomes uncontrollable. Next, an optimal control problem on a finite time horizon is considered, where the terminal mechanical energy of the rod and energy losses in the control circuit are minimized with some weighting coefficients. We show that for a fixed number of actuators distributed along the rod, approximation of the problem is reduced to the design of linear-quadratic regulators. An example of a uniform rod is presented where finite expressions for the optimal control functions are obtained. Amplitudes of controlled and affected but not minimized modes are derived for approximated suboptimal control.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis']"

Because this pandemic has hit various MSME sectors in Indonesia, especially the tourism sector, it is necessary to get more attention in order to get fast handling. Therefore, this study will discuss the impacts of COVID-19 MSMEs that operate in the tourism sector, what some tourist-heavy regions in Indonesia have been doing thus far to aid in overcoming them, and what the government can do to overcome these impacts. The purpose of this study is to help find solutions to these problems. Our research employs a qualitative research method with a descriptive type of research. The results of the research show that there are several impacts that the pandemic had on MSMEs in the tourism sector, including the lack of income generated because the source of income comes from tourist visits and a large drop in earnings and a large increase in MSME bankruptcy across the nation. Most of this occurred because the presence of COVID-19 prevents tourists from visiting. Each region has also enacted their own solutions, such as health protocols in Lampung and Kupang, and tourist-attracting marketing for Bali. The research also shows that the ministry of tourism has enacted several policies to countermeasure this issue, such as a change in how tourist-based businesses are run, safety protocols and certifications, and regulations. Our solution consists of contactless technological solutions as alternatives to travel and enactment of previously discussed government policies.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Statistics, general']"

As the literature only discusses the effect of the absolute value of housing wealth on homeowners’ labor supply, this paper studies how a homeowner’s relative housing wealth—i.e., perceived housing wealth gain compared with their reference group-affects labor market behavior. Using China’s housing boom as a natural experiment, we first construct homeowners’ reference housing wealth using the hedonic method and then estimate the effect of homeowners’ relative housing wealth on labor supply. Subsequently, we identify a causal effect of relative housing wealth on homeowners’ labor supply using an instrumental variable approach and find that an appreciation in relative housing wealth does not significantly influence homeowners’ employment, but significantly reduces their working hours. Our results show that this reduction in working hours is mainly driven by female homeowners. Our results also suggest that the effects of relative housing wealth vary across educational backgrounds, marital statuses, and locations. We find that the effect is more pronounced for female homeowners who are less educated, married, and living in rural areas. Moreover, a set of robustness checks corroborates the validity of our identification strategies and tests the sensitivity of the results.","['Economics', 'Regional/Spatial Science', 'Financial Services']"

While inclusive practices are always evolving, there has been a slow but definite progression in the shift towards an inclusive future. In today’s inclusive climate more and more children with special educational needs (SEN) are entering the mainstream classroom in which teachers are expected to cater to their needs (Bentley-Williams et al. 2017 ). However, this may prove problematic if teachers hold negative attitudes towards the inclusion of these students. Teachers’ attitudes towards inclusion may influence their willingness to accommodate students with special educational needs in regular classrooms (Bentley-Williams et al. 2017 ). Additionally, negative teacher attitudes towards inclusion generally sustain substandard academic achievements and behaviours for students with special educational needs (Bradley 2009 ). Therefore, as the topic of inclusion opens for debate, teacher attitudes become of particular interest. In order to gain a solid understanding of the complex issues associated with inclusion it is essential to examine relevant policy and legislation changes, prevalence of students with special needs, inclusive benefits and concerns, pre and in-service teacher attitudes and pre and in-service teacher training programmes in special education.","['Education', 'Education, general', 'Pedagogic Psychology', 'International and Comparative Education']"

As a result, early yielding and stiffness degradation can be observed at macro-scale stress–strain relations. Steel moment resisting frame members are made of thin-walled cross-sections, for which local or lateral-torsional buckling failure modes may occur. In order to capture inelastic material behaviour and local, as well as, lateral-torsional buckling modes, shell-type modelling approaches could be adopted. When shell elements are used, multi-axial material models are required. Continuum Damage Plasticity (CDP) framework can be used to build inelastic constitutive models. The CDP has the capability of representing both the permanent deformations due to the plastic component and the degradation of elastic moduli due to the damage component. In this paper, a shell-element based modelling approach was presented for the geometrical and material nonlinearity. Moreover, the low-cycle fatigue effects were considered within the CDP framework. After validation of the proposed approach using case studies from the literature, the possibilities of modelling different failure modes were investigated. It is shown that considerations of local- and lateral-buckling modes, as well as, the low-cycle fatigue effect may cause significant differences in predicting the behaviour of steel frames under cyclic loads.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

Existing approaches to the use of various fundamental solutions for certain space-planning conditions often allow us to provide normalized microclimate parameters, but cannot guarantee them with a certain accuracy. In this regard, numerical modelling of heat and mass transfer processes for non-standard design conditions makes it possible to identify zones whose parameters do not correspond to the normalized ones. Choosing one of the types of heating systems that provide a microclimate of the room, it is impossible to check all areas of the working area for compliance with the requirements of regulatory documents on air temperature. The tasks of checking the thermal regime of the room were considered in many studies and scientific and technical works, however, heat exchange by convection was not taken into account in these works, and the air temperature was assumed constant throughout the working area, which is not a physical solution. In this paper, computational studies were expanded by taking into account the temperature fields of the airspace for three types of heating systems using numerical modelling methods implemented in the ANSYS Fluent software package. The changes in air temperature along the height of the working area were revealed, and the “unfavourable” areas of the working area were checked for compliance with regulatory requirements.

It has been established that the «longevity» of the boundary dynamic and thermal layers of the surrounding air-heated surfaces of metallic friction elements at the open brake friction pairs are different. What unites them is that the boundary heat layer «sticks» to the metal surface, and the dynamic boundary layer «sticks» to the bottom of the main flow of the surrounding air. The frequency of application of the brake is the main factor in the break-up of the boundary heat layer of the air, which is a kind of insulator for convective heat exchange. The rotation speed of metallic friction elements during injections and open brake friction pairs determines the laminar or turbulent mode of washing with air streams of their surfaces. The dependencies of the total coefficient of resistance (C) on the Reynolds number (Re) during the longitudinal washing by the flow of air with a variable angle of attack (45–125°), the outer surfaces of the rim of the pulley, and the brake drum are determined, By separating zones of constant and significantly decreasing values of coefficient C.

Changes in the profiles of women MPs and in gender patterns of elites are unable to cancel the idea that women in Parliament form an exception, while latent questionings are perpetuated, concerning who women elected represent: the “people”, or women? The latter, usually insinuated in the demand for “more women in parliament”, attests to the confusion among different meanings of “representation”. The article deals with the history of Greek women’s presence in parliament, the pre-1989 period indicating the climate of the first “exceptional women” elected, creating a pattern of “widows and wives” in politics. Dealing with the meagre results of electoral gender quotas and attempting to generalise its considerations on the Greek case the article discusses political representation in patriarchal societies, differentiating among more and less traditional gender regimes. It questions the implied causal direction in the relation of social inequality and political exclusion, claiming that in more traditional gender regimes more women in politics do not automatically serve better women’s interests, nor do they necessarily form a solution to gender inequality. The substantive solution to women’s political exclusion presupposes rather than provokes wider social changes.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Political Sociology', 'Political Communication', 'Political Leadership']"

The study focuses on urban density, coastal zone, and urban infrastructure. East coast of India is more prone to cyclones, whereas the west coast faces more threats of floods, erosion, and irregular rainfall leading to droughts/floods. This leads to aggravate the mitigation strategies and consequences of disasters on dense urban settlements that affect adaptation strategies. The peninsular coastal region has experienced rapid urbanization with an unequal spatial distribution pattern, particularly in Kerala. Urban expansion is projected to continue in the coming years that brought more area under disaster threats. States like Goa (in percentage) and Maharashtra (absolute number) have the highest level of urbanization in the country. Each coastal city in India is either facing challenges of infrastructure or basic services. The environmental threats to these coastal regions cannot be ignored. Keeping physical conditions of coastal belt in consideration, the coastal region is in various developing stages from Utkal coast to Kathiawar peninsula. This study emphasizes urban agglomeration and infrastructural development since globalization. Demographic change clearly marked the dividing line between coastal and inland states of India, which is also not untouched by disasters. Furthermore, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) cannot be ignored after Odisha’s (1999) most destructive super cyclone.

The article claims that part of the success of the movies can be explained by the ample freedom of pre-code Hollywood in representing and—up to a certain extent—glorifying crime and violence. Sound cinema was also relatively new at that time and therefore gunshots, car chases and police sirens had a bigger impact on audiences still used to silent movies. The protagonists of both these films were inspired by the figure of Al Capone; the chapter analyzes the difference between the two, underlining how Rico Bandello in Little Caesar is a rather flat character, while Tony Camonte in Scaraface represents a much more complex and nuanced gangster.

About 1.6% of the global agricultural land area is currently managed by OA practices. In the twentieth century, pioneers such as Rudolf Steiner, Sir Albert Howard, Lady Eve Balfour, Jerome Irving Rodale and Masanobu Fukuoka developed OA systems in reaction to perceived failures of conventional or nonorganic agriculture. Early types of OA included bio-dynamic, natural, biological, ecological and organic-biological agriculture. The International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) provides a definition of modern OA. However, there is no single interpretation of what OA practices and principles entail, and OA production systems continue to evolve. Among common OA practices are fertilization with organic instead of mineral fertilizers, use of natural-derived instead of synthetic plant protection products, and mechanical instead of chemical crop system management. Importantly, OA is the only farming system whose management practices are codified by law in most countries. However, OA is faced with several challenges such as the 19–25% lower crop yield compared to that under conventional or nonorganic practices, the lack of animal and green manure produced on OA farms to satisfy the demand at other OA farms, and lack of plant and animal varieties specifically adapted to OA soil and land-use management practices. Increased efforts are, thus, needed to improve the contribution of OA systems to environmental health as consumer demand for OA products continues to rise globally.","['Life Sciences', 'Agriculture', 'Climate Change', 'Climate Change/Climate Change Impacts', 'Climate Change Management and Policy']"

This chapter aims to summarize the current research efforts concerning the testing and analysis of the creep and the creep recovery of cementitious materials at both macro and micro scales. The instrumented indentation technique is used to evaluate the creep behavior of cementitious materials at both nano and micro scales. A strong analogy of the logarithmic creep behavior is found between the cementitious materials and the soils, and the creep modulus is an intrinsic parameter that reflects the long-term creep rate of cement paste. A dashpot with a variable viscosity that increases linearly with time can capture the logarithmic creep behavior. In addition, the ratio of the recoverable creep to the total creep can be obtained based on the measured results using two indentation schemes, i.e., the “loading-holding-unloading-reholding” scheme and the “loading-unloading-reholding” scheme, and the recoverable creep can account for up to 0.41 of the total creep. The content of this chapter is expected to provide an in-depth understanding of the testing and analysis of micro creep and creep recovery of cementitious materials.","['Chemistry', 'Chemistry/Food Science, general', 'Materials Science, general', 'Characterization and Evaluation of Materials', 'Building Materials']"

To fully capture the localized effect of the crack, a global-local coupled finite element (FE) model is first created. An iterative global-local (IGL) algorithm is then developed to provide increased accuracy over sub-modelling at the expense of increased computational cost. To replace the process of solving the complex local FE, a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model is further constructed to increase the computational efficiency. By interpolating the nodal displacement values collected from the surface around the crack, another GP surrogate model is developed to generate synthetic images similar to that obtained from cameras. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently predict the parameters of the crack growth model as well as to estimate the true crack length.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Complexity', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Statistical Theory and Methods']"

In this paper, the stress distribution and deformation of thin blade edge of TC17 titanium alloy under multi-point impact were studied by numerical simulation. By controlling the action distance of plastic wave, the process parameters of single-sided laser shock strengthening of thin blade edge were designed. The results show that the solution time of dynamic shock is 10000 ns according to the energy curve. By changing the boundary constraints of thin blade, such as bottom constraint, cantilever constraint and both ends constraint, to simulate the actual processing situation, the distribution of residual stress in bottom constraint is the most uniform, the increase of residual stress in the processing area is more obvious, and the material deformation is the least. Based on the commonly used processing parameters of 3 mm laser spot and 20 ns pulse width, 30% overlap ratio is adopted to avoid uneven impact or excessive local stress. The residual stress is about 104, 247 and 450 MPa when 2, 3 and 5 J energy are used respectively; the blade edge deformation is controlled at about 4 μm.

The project involved participants in a porous ecosystem of knowledge exchange that subsequently informed several design research stages, prior to finalisation of designs for mass production. It also involved evaluators in creating the means to test and assess the performance of design processes as well as the generation of furniture for the prison estate. This chapter reviews the strengths and pragmatic constraints in trying to utilise a collaborative design approach to aid problem-solving in prison. Ultimately, it seeks to raise questions for prison industries about strategic and collaborative design activity within criminal justice settings. It reviews how approaches to risk management within the prison estate—important for safety and security—present challenges to the implementation of design-led and co-production change agendas useful for prisons and already being successfully pioneered by other government agencies.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

An especially interesting application are material removal processes and specifically machining. Use of robots in machining has opened new pathways for the development of flexible, portable robotic cells for several use cases. However, the peculiarity of such cells compared to traditional machine tools calls for novel approaches in their design and dynamic analysis. To this end, this work proposes an approach that integrates the digital twin of the machining process to set the boundary conditions for the design and dynamic analysis of the robotic cell. Physics-based modelling of milling is coupled with a Multi-Body Simulation of the robotic arm to define the inputs for the design of the cell. The design and dynamic analysis of the robotic cell is performed in a commercial FEA package, taking into account the requirements of the machining process.","['Engineering', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering', 'Computer-Aided Engineering (CAD, CAE) and Design']"

It argues that unipolarity offered a high room for manoeuvre for both the United States as the sole great power and Canada as a U.S. ally to carry out their preferred foreign and security policies between 2006 and 2011. The United States adopted offensive dominance, whereas Canada undertook an opportunistic foreign policy. However, the Afghan irregular warfare constituted a restrictive strategic environment that paved the way for both countries to operationalize their foreign and security policies as irregular warfare strategies. Both countries operationalized dominance and opportunism as counterinsurgency (COIN), which was a consequential response to al Qaeda’s transformation, the emergence of the Afghan insurgency, and the historical, institutional, and socio-economic factors conducive to this insurgency.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'International Relations Theory', 'Military and Defence Studies', 'International Security Studies']"

Yet, health in terms of a well-functioning body and mind is a crucial precondition for employment. In the workplace, health is inextricably tied to work capacity: What matters is the degree to which health enables or hampers a person to meet given productivity standards. Work in capacity due to health impairments therefore raises deeply normative questions not only for the economy but also for the welfare state. To what extent is incapacity to be tolerated in the productivity-driven world of work, and what is the just and adequate support for people with disabilities who cannot make a living through gainful work? Convention theory offers a number of useful theoretical concepts to analyze these questions, which organize the presentation of EC/SC research on health and employment in this chapter. Handling work incapacity depends on classification: What counts as standard work capacity, or, conversely, as incapacity which legitimizes special treatment? Managing health troubles triggers disputes and requires justifications in the economy and in the welfare system. The (non-)employment of people with health impairments depends on the valorization of labor, which in turn relates to a plurality of quality conventions and respective tests. Finally, dealing with work incapacity is structured by investments in forms that allow classification, valorization, and the coordination of labor market inclusion and support.","['Economics', 'Labor Economics', 'Heterodox Economics', 'Organizational Studies, Economic Sociology']"

Therefore, according to Vision Zero, there are three main strategies to eliminate fatalities and severe injuries due to road crashes: protect people from exposure of harmful energy, reduce the risk of events with harmful energy, and protect people from harmful energy in the event of a collision. Controlling speed is therefore of the task of utmost importance in a strategy such as Vision Zero. A traffic enforcement camera, or “speed camera,” system has the possibility to control speed in a road system, and it has the possibility to affect its road users both at a macro and a micro perspective. In a micro perspective, it primarily concerns how effective the cameras are locally at the road sections where the enforcement is focused on, while at a macro perspective it is more focused on how the camera enforcement system and strategies, possibly together with the overall enforcement strategy, affects attitudes and norms related to driving with excessive speed. Experience worldwide has proven the effectiveness of automated speed cameras in reducing speed and, in turn, crashes and injuries. In this chapter, firstly the rationale behind speed limits, speed management, and speed compliance strategies will be explored and analyzed, in particular from a Vision Zero perspective. Secondly, various different approaches to speed camera systems in Europe, in Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, and France, will be analyzed and further explored. Finally, based on similarities and differences in approaches in these countries, in the last section some aspects concerning the setting of speed limits, speed management strategies that underpin the choice of camera technology, and modus of operandi, safety effects of and attitudes toward cameras, will be explored and discussed.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

Consequently, numerous tools, techniques, paradigms, and strategies that facilitate the quality assurance of the developed applications have emerged. Test-driven development (TDD) is one of those strategies. In contrast to the traditional approach, it places testing ahead of the actual implementation, which, in turn, also heavily influences the system’s design. With the approach being rather complex, naturally, guidance on its correct application is one of the most relevant aspects for many practitioners. To provide assistance to them, but also to researchers concerned with the domain, the publication at hand identifies twenty guidelines for the practical application of TDD in software engineering, by conducting a structured literature review.

This chapter responds to this need and explores the potential of intersectionality in this area. By approaching intersectionality as an analytical sensibility , this chapter explores the potential of an intersectional interpretive framework to generate knowledge practices that can make contributions to the design, implementation, and development of reflexive democratic deepening processes which take into account the complexity with which human relationships are interwoven with dynamics of domination and privilege. It does so by outlining different uses of intersectionality in the context of two research projects that have made up part of our professional research careers: Unveiling Oppression and Resistance of Women in Zumarraga and Stigma at the Service of Power. Through the diverse and complex uses that these projects have made of an intersectional interpretive framework, we demonstrate the potential of intersectionality and the analytical tools it deploys to identify and confront one-dimensional and disempowering perspectives on oppression. Through this process of reflection, the text delves into an approach which understands intersectionality as an open, reflexive, and complex tool essential for advancing toward a democratic deepening prioritizing social justice concerns.

As such, it is often difficult to isolate which elements of the institutional environment may impact behaviour or general wellbeing, and whether those elements are working as intended. With an emphasis on U.S. prison systems, this chapter explores the most common challenges in conducting research—and establishing causality—on custodial architecture.

The chapter then concludes with a discussion of several potential solutions that might allow future studies to surmount those challenges, including establishing a consistent definition of custodial design and its elements, the collection of more detailed custodial data, and methods for distinguishing the impact of design from other potential influences.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"
doi:10.1007/s12613-021-2388-x,en,Tension—compression asymmetry and corresponding deformation mechanism in ZA21 magnesium bars with bimodal structure,OriginalPaper,"We investigated the asymmetric tension—compression (T—C) behavior of ZA21 bars with bimodal and uniform structures through axial tension and compression tests. The results show that the yield strengths of bars having bimodal structure are 206.42 and 140.28 MPa under tension and compression, respectively, which are higher than those of bars having uniform structure with tensile and compressive yield strength of 183.71 and 102.86 MPa, respectively. Prismatic slip and extension twinning under tension and basal slip and extension twinning under compression dominate the yield behavior and induce the T—C asymmetry. However, due to the basal slip activated in fine grains under tension and the inhibition of extension twinning by fine grains under compression, the bimodal structure possesses a lower T—C asymmetry (0.68) compared to the uniform structure (0.56). Multiple extension twins occur during deformation, and the selection of twin variants depends on the Schmid factor of the six variants activated by parent grains. Furthermore, the strengthening effect of the bimodal structure depends on the grain size and the ratio of coarse and fine grains.","['Materials Science', 'Materials Science, general', 'Metallic Materials', 'Characterization and Evaluation of Materials', 'Ceramics, Glass, Composites, Natural Materials', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings']"

In Industrial Design, as in multi-scale architectural design, the explication of algorithmic thinking promotes research directions based on the centrality of the concept of code-procedure for building geometric-informative models. The representation of complex geometric shapes, through the visual programming of digital algorithms (generative, algorithmic and computational modelling), in addition to bringing about a methodological and applicative renewal, has made it possible to initiate trans-disciplinary investigations. The semantic and digital three-dimensional model simulates, collects and manages not only geometric data, but also structural, energy related and construction aspects of an artefact, putting them in relation with each other and thus improving the interaction and dialogue between the design figures involved in the process. Form-finding simulation and latest generation digital manufacturing techniques are described, preparatory to the study and design of bamboo structures, described in the following chapters. The chapter concludes by focusing the attention on some recent experiments of exhibition pavilions, temporary architectural structures that lend themselves well to possible applications of bamboo with new design and construction approaches.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Light Construction, Steel Construction, Timber Construction', 'Sustainable Development']"

The main challenges of WSNs are time synchronization, transmission of large amounts of data, and energy consumption. In this paper, autocovariance functions (ACFs) are estimated in all sensor nodes. Strict time synchronization is not necessary, because cross-correlations are not utilized. The measurement period must be long for a sufficient accuracy, but the number of samples in the transmitted ACFs is much smaller. The ACFs from all sensor nodes are transmitted to the base station for centralized data processing. Spatiotemporal correlation can be utilized, because for a stationary random process the ACFs have the same form as the free decay of the system. The covariance matrix is estimated using the training data from the undamaged structure under different environmental conditions. An extreme value statistics control chart is designed to detect damage. A numerical experiment was performed by simulating a bridge deck under stationary random excitation and variable environmental conditions. The excitation or environmental variables were not measured. Damage was a crack in a steel girder. Nonsimultaneous sampling of the WSN was simulated by selecting the starting time of the measurement randomly in each sensor node.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Phenomena such as differential settlements, damage or failure of structural elements, overloads, etc., cause buildings to behave differently than expected. When any of these phenomena occur, due to multiple factors, it is not possible to determine precisely the distribution of stresses in the building and therefore, it is difficult to establish with any degree of reliability if there are elements that may be subjected to stress levels that could cause a critical failure of the structure. In this paper, the development of a low-cost fiber optic-based transducer intended to force/stress measuring in civil structure pillars within the SHM context is presented. Test transducers were embedded in scale reduced columns, which were submitted to compression loads using a testing bench rig. Transducers successfully measured strain levels up to 200 $$\upmu \upepsilon $$ μ ϵ under compression load with an accuracy of ±1 $$\upmu \upepsilon $$ μ ϵ . Strains and applied force were linearly related. Through finite element analysis (FEA), a sensing scheme was designed for the first floor of a 32-story-tall building composed of 32 columns where each column includes one embedded transducer. The constructive phase of building will start by April 2022, when transducers will be embedded within the structure. It is expected to detect load redistribution during the construction phase of the building and its operational phase.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The unchecked shift from offline to online poses a central threat to stationary retail. This results from the increasing digitalization, which already determines a large part of everyday life and thus consumer behavior and customer expectations. It is also changing the demands on experience orientation and service. But the internationalization and “platformization” of retail is also putting considerable pressure on traditional retailers, especially since many of them are still refusing to undergo a digital transformation. To make matters worse, in the wake of increasing vacancies as well as changing mobility, the role of city centers is also changing, making them less dependent on retail. The new survival formula is called “customer centricity”, which, however, only works digitally based.","['Business and Management', 'Trade']"

This paper studies a formation control problem of a multi-robot system based on leader-followers mode. Firstly, according to the formation constraint, a kinematic model is established such that the formation problem is transformed into a trajectory-tracking problem of the robots. Based on this model, a backstepping sliding mode (BSM) control algorithm is proposed to ensure the convergence of follower robots’ tracking errors. In addition, the stability of the whole control system is substantiated in the sense of Lyapunov. Finally, the performance of the designed BSM controller is tested by simulation in circular and curvilinear formation scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate that our presented BSM control law possesses high tracking accuracy.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Multiagent Systems', 'Systems Theory, Control']"

This study employed annual data, which was collected for the period 1960–2017, and analyzed this data using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach and the Granger causality framework. The empirical evidence shows that the following: (1) the short run and long run ARDL model confirmed that the growth of fish production and growth of livestock production in the Gambia have significant positive impacts on the growth of GDP. (2) The short run and long run ARDL model indicated that growth of food import and growth of agriculture have negative impacts on the growth of GDP. (3) Granger causality analysis between the lagged values of growth of GDP and lagged values of growth of food availability indicators has unidirectional relationships. (4) Lagged values of the growth of GDP Granger causes lagged values of growth of agriculture but lagged values of growth of agriculture does not Granger cause lagged values of growth of GDP, which suggested an indirect relationship. (5) The relationship between the lagged values of growth of crop production and lagged values of growth of agriculture indicates a bidirectional relationship.

The finite element model of slab with holes was built by ABAQUS to analyze the distributing characteristics and influence factors of vertical shear strain in holes under aircraft load. The model test of slab with holes was designed to obtain the vertical shear strain and its distribution characteristics in the holes. The research results show that there is a linear correlation between vertical shear strain and flexural-tensile strain with the same location of aircraft load. The distributing characteristics of vertical shear strains are different in different holes. In addition the results obtained from the model experiment show that distributing characteristics of vertical shear strain in holes are in accord with theory resolution and finite element analysis results. The shear strain in the holes increases with the load’s increasing. Flexural-tensile strains on the slab bottom calculated by vertical shear strain in holes differ from the measured values with maximum value of 16% and this value is conform to the engineering test require, which indicates that the monitoring technology of flexural-tensile strain calculated by shear strain is feasibility and the state of the existing pavement slab can be monitored with this technique.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Public Policy', 'Arts']"

Both thermal conductivity and the effect of the phase change of liquid on the heat transfer behavior of FMHP were simulated using BAQUS of CFD software. The investigation was carried out on an FMHP, with a horizontal orientation, for different powers and different cooling temperatures. The wall temperature distribution along the FMHP was studied. The results show that the FMHP is more effective in reducing the temperature gradient than a copper plate of the same dimensions. The capillary limit is attained at the same power regardless of the temperature of the cold source. In addition, the effective thermal conductivity is considerably increased compared to that of a copper plate. On the other hand, a study is done on the influence of some parameters such as the power imposed on the evaporator, the temperature of the cold source and the geometrical characteristics of the FMHP (lengths of the evaporator and the condenser) on the variation of the temperature distribution of the wall. A comparison between model results and experimental findings from previous work shows the numerical model’s good ability in predicting the distribution of the axial temperature along the FMHP.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Materials Engineering', 'Classical and Continuum Physics']"

This article addresses these debates by exploring two interrelated questions: What drives the continuous efforts to place climate change on the UNSC’s agenda and to what extent do the UNSC’s debates illustrate an ongoing process of climatization? To answer these, the article draws on the concept of climatization, which captures the process through which domains of international politics are framed through a climate lens and transformed as a result of this translation. It suggests that climate change has become a dominant framing and an inescapable topic of international relations and that the UNSC debates follow a logic of expansion of climate politics by securing a steady climate agenda, attributing responsibility to the Council in the climate crisis, involving climate actors and advocating for climate-oriented policies to maintain international security.","['Social Sciences', 'Environmental Policy', 'Political Science and International Relations, general', 'Political Theory', 'Governance and Government', 'International Environmental Law']"

Gattaca n society – divided among what are called “In-valids” and “Valids” – is built on intrinsic genoism that strongly favors the Valids. Despite some claims in the movie, In-valids are not treated the way they are because of some testable statistical claim about their substandard abilities; they are treated as though they simply are substandard in virtue of being In-valids. In-valids are excluded from many opportunities in the society, but Valids too may be denied an open future via imperfect engineering or even a too-specific customization of their genotype. Moreover, despite what the genetic engineers say about providing the “best start in life,” even those children who received the best possible engineering can’t choose a life theme and will therefore still struggle to live quality lives. The movie confronts us again and again with the unfairness and injustice that result from genoism, and does so in a way that suggests a solution very much in line with John Rawls’s work on justice as fairness.","['Cultural and Media Studies', 'Popular Culture', 'Philosophy, general']"

The urgency of the work is justified, given the large number of outdated control systems for DC electric drives at metallurgical enterprises in the Dnieper region. There are even drives with a generator-DC motor system in the presence of thyristor converters in the excitation windings of motors and generators, such as a generator system – a blooming DC motor 1050 in a rolling shop №1 PJSC “Dnieper Metallurgical Plant”, a generator system – DC motor rolling shop of PJSC “Dnieper Metallurgical Plant”. There are also more modern – for example, digital system thyristor converter – DC motor of the electric drive of a calibration condition in the conditions of rolling shop №7 INTERPIPE NIKO TUBE, Nikopol. The power of the main drives is from 80 kW to 8 MW. Also, the aim of the work is to create a general classical mathematical model of the DC electric drive with observers to identify such parameters as the moment of inertia, the resistance of the armature circuit. The obtained results give an idea of the interdependence of the main parameters of the electric drive, which characterize and influence the dynamic properties of observers – the roots of the characteristic equation, structural coefficients, the frequency of undamped oscillations. The practical value includes recommendations for adjusting the control circuits for regenerative monitoring devices, the coordinates of the electric drive, which are obtained as a result of research on a mathematical model. The recommendations can be used as input, for example in the configuration of control systems, control circuits for digital complete DC electric drives in environments such as the TIA Portal Siemens before the first start-up of electric drives in the plant.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes']"

The chapter provides insight into the strengths and weaknesses of these diverse approaches to refugee recognition. It also discusses the interview process for refugee status determination (RSD) purposes, the best practices and skills needed in RSD interviewing, and the quality of RSD interviewing. The process of resettlement, one of the three durable solutions to displacement, is described, as well as the application and approval process in various country signatories of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, which binds signatories to resettle refugees in their communities.

From this complex debate three dominant visions emerge—intergovernmentalism, neo-functionalism and post-functionalism—which can be used to better understand the current developments of the EU political system. For instance, they can shed light on the complex appointment process of the von der Leyen Commission which was quite conflictual and messy. It highlighted the tensions between various visions of the EU and the deep disagreement among actors on the role of the EP in the process. Some national leaders were expecting the EP to approve what had been negotiated within the European Council with the elected President of the Commission. However, despite the failure of the Spitzenkandidaten process, or because of it, most MEPs intended to exert real control over the commissioners-designate. This tension peaked with the rejection of French commissioner-designate Sylvie Goulard. This paper assesses this sequence through the lenses of the main theories of European integration. By doing so, it aims at improving our understanding of the existing institutional dynamics within the EU political system.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Public Policy', 'Legislative and Executive Politics']"

The COVID-19 pandemic further limited opportunities for serious deliberation of constitutional change, and Abe’s resignation left the issue with no cheerleader to push the issue onto the legislative agenda. Given the lower priority placed on constitutionalism by Abe’s successors, opposition parties also saw less reason to make constitutionalism a centerpiece of their election manifestos.

First, the presence of a local gradient that deforms the potential energy surface and leads to unidirectionality. This can be caused by the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope, which is also a very suitable instrument to follow the motion of individual molecules. Second, intrinsic unidirectionality of a molecule-surface system, which is of particular interest to be employed in molecular machines for useful work at the atomic scale.","['Materials Science', 'Materials Science, general', 'Nanoscale Science and Technology']"

Finally, we elucidate the centrality of forms of accommodation in the re-design of the Unit, involving compromise and negotiation. We conclude that attuning analysis of prison design to the everyday processes and practices that shape much of the custodial estate enables insights to improve the re-design and adaptations of existing prisons.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Prison and Punishment', 'Crime Control and Security', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Community and Environmental Psychology', 'Arts', 'Human Geography']"

This has empowered Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) to take benefit of such revolution and build a smart criminal investigation ecosystem. Generally, LEAs collect data through surveillance systems (e.g., cameras); which are implemented on public places in order to recognize people behaviors and visually identify those who may form any danger or risk. In this paper, we focus on knives-related crimes or attacks that have been increased in recent years. In order to ensure public safety, it is crucial to detect such type of attacks in an accurate and efficient way in order to help LEAs in reducing potential consequences. We propose a smart video surveillance system (SVSS), which is based on a modified Single Shot Detector (SSD) and is combined with InceptionV2 and MobileNetV2 models. The proposed system is believed to enable LEAs to analyze big data collected from sensor cameras in a real-time and to accurately detect knives-based attacks.

Since temperature affects ultrasonic velocity, temperature fluctuations and non-uniform temperature distributions in components are a major source of uncertainty for ultrasonic measurements. Recently, ultrasound-based temperature sensing methods have gained increasing attention because of their ability to measure subsurface temperature distributions in solid media. While conventional ultrasonic techniques can either measure the thickness of a component at constant temperature or the (subsurface) temperature of the component at constant thickness, measurement accuracy and precision can be greatly compromised if both factors vary simultaneously. In this work, we explore a dual wave approach to overcome this limitation of the conventional methods. Results of simulation and experimental studies show that co-located shear and longitudinal pulse echo measurements can be used to determine both the thickness and through-thickness temperature gradient of a steel plate while the structure is undergoing thickness loss at rapidly changing temperature.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

As university funding structures crumble and instead hone in on new student markets and the pursuit of big grants, the pressure on us increases and so, in turn, research calls become increasingly competitive. Many of us are continually rejected particularly if we try to do ethnographic research and even more so if it means that it is done ‘differently’, ‘unconventionally’ and ‘covertly’ with some of society’s most dangerous and hard-to-reach groups. Notwithstanding the time invested in writing proposals and even in the event they are successful, before commencement, projects must also secure ethical clearance – a means of research governance and control, which frowns on ethnography – thus reducing further time and resource away from the studying the fast-paced change of the twenty-first century. We subsequently believe that our academic worth thereafter translates to further investment in publishing in ‘high-impact-factor journals’ and producing a seemingly never-ending stream of social media updates and waiting for ‘likes’ about our ‘research excellence’ and academic activity. However, as I saw written on the wall of a building where thousands of Bosnians were executed in the 1990s genocide ‘a like doesn’t change the world’. In the same vein, we have to ask ourselves if what we are doing actually contributes to the positive social change we outline in our research proposals. If – because of restrictive funding calls and ethics committees – we cannot access the world’s most excluded groups, study between the nooks and crannies of democratic societies and propose unconventional research methods, how can we report on the real harms of the social structure? This paper offers a twofold reflection – firstly, how can one ‘break from the shackles’ of this academic capitalism, and secondly, it evidences what this liberation can produce by providing reflexive analysis of three ethnographic projects I have undertaken over the last 5 years: (1) a two-year study of Spain’s largest drug market, (2) a three-year study of the refugee crisis across Europe and (3) an 18-month undercover study of a luxury brothel.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Research Methods in Criminology', 'Critical Criminology', 'Criminological Theory']"

Using survey data from Italy, we provide robust evidence that integrated immigrants, who state they have strong feelings of belonging to the societies of both the host and home country, have higher employment rates than do assimilated immigrants, who identify exclusively with the host country culture. Unlike previous literature, our findings indicate that assimilation does not necessarily provide a clear labor market advantage over immigrants who identify only with their original ethnic group. The positive labor market effect of integration is especially large for women, low-skilled, and immigrants with a brief experience in Italy and arriving in Italy at older ages, who generally face stronger barriers to entry into the labor market. The main mechanism driving the positive effect of multiple social identities points to belonging to local networks that ensure in-group favoritism and sharing of information.","['Economics', 'Population Economics', 'Labor Economics', 'Demography', 'Social Policy']"

Adversaries are no longer amateurs that randomly probe and compromise many computing devices; they are equipped with advanced intelligence of domain-specific knowledge of the target system and act to achieve a specific goal, e.g., disrupting physical processes. Like a well-trained sniper, adversaries can target a small number of certain devices and can exploit legitimate control operations or well-crafted measurements to inflict physical damage without introducing system- or network-level anomalies. This chapter will present our belief that can effectively address those advanced threats, i.e., integrating domain-specific knowledge of a target system (with the main focus on smart power grids) into general-purpose security solutions.

In the domain of governance, it serves the citizens’ need for information access and the use of governance procedures seamlessly. Policing is an important arm of governance, and therefore, it is imperative to understand the usage behavior of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) among police personnel. In this study, police personnel from the state of Rajasthan have been studied for their ICT adoption behavior. The aim of this study is to identify the factors which enable ICT adoption among police personnel. For the study, Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology have been used to design the questionnaire scale. 90 police personnel were randomly selected as respondents for the quantitative survey. Inferential statistics were used to extract the most determiners of the ICT adoption behavior among the respondent population. Findings indicate that in the given context, performance, effort, and social influence are the strong predictors of intention to use ICT in policing. Self-efficacy and Anxiety did not play any role in creating the intention of the user. The facilitating conditions and intention to use leads the user to actually engage with ICT.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

The paper presents a summary of the current state of the BiH water services sector and identifies shortcomings as the reasons for the poor state of this sector. To implement the reform, and in cooperation with international development partners, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Water Management and Forestry (FMAWMF) coordinated the process of the Program drafting. The starting point for the development of the Program is the vision of the reform of the water services sector as a functional system, which ensures sustainable and quality water supply and other water management services in accordance with EU standards. Achieving this vision requires a harmonized regulatory framework; efficient institutions defined by legal regulations and defined, functional, and controlled financial flows that ensure operational efficiency and full cost recovery. The paper presents the activities required for the implementation of the Program to achieve greater sustainable development of water service providers/suppliers (public water utility companies). At the end of the paper, key recommendations for the improvement of the BiH water services sector and concluding remarks were given.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Development Studies', 'Environmental Policy', 'Sociology, general', 'Environmental and Sustainability Education']"

Diverse linear text segmentation methods can be incorporated into the system by introducing new agents, which allows to combine complementary approaches: domain-specific, supervised and unsupervised. The system must be supplied with a representative set of previously segmented documents from the target corpus, which are used both to train the supervised agents and to evaluate every agent within the system, similar to ensemble methods. The accuracy of each agent determines its weight in a subsequent aggregation phase, when a common solution is agreed on.

Other writers of this period—professional and “amateur” alike—also realized the limitations of writing for the commercial public, and some chose to avoid it entirely, joining a long tradition of manuscript circulation. In this chapter I discuss Austen’s unpublished work as something beyond “juvenilia” or apprentice writing, but at least periodically a choice that allowed her more freedom than the commercial press ever could. I place Austen among writers with whom she has never before been considered: writers of unpublished fiction that survives in various archives. These men and women, of all ages, left behind a variety of works that show many of the ways that privately circulated manuscripts could operate. Specifically, I make reference to a small sample set of manuscripts produced during Austen’s lifetime in order to contextualize Austen’s own manuscript production. Placing Austen’s work—the published novels and the manuscripts—in this context gives us new insights into the choices she made when entering the world of print. These different models of audience and circulation also allow us to better understand what we now call transformative works or fan fiction: practices closely tied to Austen readership in the twenty-first century. Modern fan practices challenge us to ask new questions of Austen’s unpublished work.","['Literature', 'Nineteenth-Century Literature', 'Literature, general', 'Literary Theory']"

The discipline criticizes the labeling carried out by the criminal justice system, which marks certain groups of people as “deviant,” “criminal,” or “dangerous.” Nevertheless, criminological studies often fall into the same trap. By relying on labels that the criminal justice system has applied when accessing the field through prisons, probation officers, or other kinds of support systems for offenders, sampling and labeling are intertwined. This article scrutinizes how qualitative reconstructive research supports and reproduces social inequality. It applies the concept of “doing social problems” and emphasizes a constructionist point of view. Furthermore, we review the sampling mechanisms of recent studies: What concepts of “social problems” do we see? What world does the criminological research at hand reconstruct? In our conclusion, we call for a sensitive approach and a broad discussion of possibilities and limitations. To us, qualitative reconstructive research – in fact – seems to offer some solutions for making the processes of labeling visible. We ask how social knowledge systems concerning crime and deviance are constituted and how we, as criminologists, contribute to them through our research practice.","['Criminology and Criminal Justice', 'Research Methods in Criminology', 'Critical Criminology', 'Criminological Theory']"

In Europe in the 1900s, promethazine was used to treat circulatory shock, when a French surgeon noticed patients on promethazine became calm and somnolent. From there, chlorpromazine, reserpine, and the benzodiazepines made their entry. These drugs were considered symptomatic treatments and were used irrespective of any underlying psychiatric diagnosis. Gradually, the idea took hold that these drugs were treating certain disorders instead of just sedating patients. Tranquillizers were renamed antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, hypnotics, and mood stabilizers. Side effects as “an interesting inversion of clinical manifestations” were soon noted. Agitation turned into depression, and psychotic reactions and increased anxiety occurred, as did suicidal ideation and acts. Extremely violent homicides were noted in both adults and children. Akathisia, agitation, mania, and emotional blunting were present in many individuals committing acts of violence. Many psychotropic drugs react with monoamine neurotransmitters, interfering with the brain’s neural network leading to chemical lobotomies and dysexecutive syndromes.","['Psychology', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Emotion', 'Personality and Social Psychology']"

XRF allows to obtain chemical analyses, in elements or in oxides, expressed as percent atoms or atoms in percent weight, alternatively as oxides, stoichiometrically binding the oxygen to the dosed cation. Depending on the accuracy of the desired data and on the sample characteristics, the XRF can be used as partially destructive or as absolutely non-destructive technique; consequently, the sample required for an analysis varies from few tens of milligrams up to about 12 g, depending on the selected analytical procedure and the type of instrumentation. In the last decades, the diffusion of the ED silicon drift detectors, together with the development of very accurate and high specialised software for quantitative analysis, increased the diffusion of portable spectrometers offering new possibilities for in-situ and very rapid specimen characterizations, useful during forensic investigations, particularly on samples that cannot be removed for legal reasons or difficult to transport as being too large.

In consequence, the historical variability of their practice and impact remains understudied. Building on a short survey of current research, this contribution addresses the forms, functions, and situations of acclamation in Europe during the Age of Revolutions. Focusing on the tensions between the practice’s symbolic holism—suggesting a direct expression of the communities’ undivided will—and its underlying complexities as a mode of collective action, it argues that acclamations gained a historically unique impact during the (post-)revolutionary period. While other opportunities for political articulation and participation remained sharply constrained, these public vocalizations presented one of the very few available modes of regular political engagement. At the same time, public interactions between rulers and ‘the people’ gained new performative significance against the background of experiences of political upheaval and regime change. A consideration of a wide range of case studies from across the continent shows how practices of acclamation and their reception became part of a transnationally entangled contestation of political legitimacy, constituting an ephemeral, but momentous mode of popular politics.","['History', 'Social History', 'Political History', 'European History', 'Modern History', 'World History, Global and Transnational History']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-09659-4_48,en,The Role of Perfectionism in Music Performance Anxiety Within University Piano Majors in China,OriginalPaper,"Music Performance Anxiety (MPA) is a recurring issue for some musicians in the process of accomplishing the demanding coordination of physical and psychological tasks that music performance requires. Several studies have reported a correlation between higher levels of perfectionism in musicians and greater likelihood of experiencing music performance anxiety (Kenny 2011 ; Patston and Osborne 2016 ). Although multiple factors have been identified as contributing to the development of MPA among Chinese piano students, especially among undergraduate and postgraduate learners majoring in music at universities, no current study has offered a comprehensive analysis of its root causes (Yang 2006 ) and this paper will contribute towards it. In the context of China’s Confucian socio-cultural norms, education and personal performance have been highly valued. The following four-words idiom and Confucian saying from the Analects vividly describes the attitude Confucius pursues in learning: “Have an insatiable desire to learn” ( ); “Being curious and fond of learning and not ashamed to learn from one’s inferiors.” ( ). However, the ultimate pursuit of perfectionism in personal performance and the perception of discrepancy between higher perfectionist criteria and performance would lead to considerably higher level of anxiety (Mor et al. 1995 ; Flett et al. 1998 ). Therefore, this current study investigates the roles of different forms of perfectionism on MPA amongst Chinese university students majoring in piano. An online survey of 195 students from five universities in China was carried out in 2021. The researcher conducted both correlational and multiple regression analyses on different sub-scales of perfectionism and dimensions of MPA. Regarding perfectionism and MPA, students who demonstrated more socially prescribed perfectionism traits were more likely to experience negative cognition and fear of other’s scrutiny as featured in MPA. Further analyses showed that both Self-oriented and Socially prescribed perfectionism are positive predictors of MPA. The findings of this study presented here may provide new clues to analyse the roles of perfectionism in MPA in the Chinese context.","['Architecture / Design', 'Industrial Design', 'Digital/New Media', 'Structural Materials', 'Music']"

The scale and intensity of destruction has prompted serious rethinking about recovery, reconstruction and the meanings of authenticity in different contexts. ICOMOS recognised that the complexities attending ideas of reconstruction had to be set against the urgent need to introduce guidance for dealing with post-trauma recovery and reconstruction. In 2018, the World Heritage Committee formally directed the attention of its advisory bodies towards examining case studies.

How this microscopic-macroscopic interaction occurs is poorly understood, as researchers frequently examine models within particular ranges of abstraction and scale. Computational neuroscience and machine learning models offer theoretically powerful analyses of plasticity in neural networks, but results are often siloed and only coarsely linked to biology. In this review, we examine connections between these areas, asking how network computations change as a function of diverse features of plasticity and vice versa. We review how plasticity can be controlled at synapses by calcium dynamics and neuromodulatory signals, the manifestation of these changes in networks, and their impacts in specialized circuits. We conclude that metaplasticity—defined broadly as the adaptive control of plasticity—forges connections across scales by governing what groups of synapses can and can’t learn about, when, and to what ends. The metaplasticity we discuss acts by co-opting Hebbian mechanisms, shifting network properties, and routing activity within and across brain systems. Asking how these operations can go awry should also be useful for understanding pathology, which we address in the context of autism, schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Psychiatry', 'Neurosciences', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Biological Psychology']"

This polyphony of voices is still little known in European and North American philosophical circles, even though they address the same twentieth- and twenty first-century challenges – challenges which are difficult to deal with without the achievements of science and technology (and techno-scientific systems) and their consequences for the natural world, the human condition and collective life, as well as in terms of new uncertainties in the future. Some of the voices collected here view technology in a world historical period characterised by the twilight of empires, dictatorial domination, the destruction brought about by wars already carried out under industrialized science, the nuclear threat, and propaganda, but also by the winds of decolonization, economic growth driven by the science-technology complex and by big science, the increase in the influence of the media and the birth of the consumer society. Other voices, from a subsequent generation, have experienced a context in which new dilemmas have arisen, associated with the irruption of the techno-sciences, in particular in the domains of biotechnology and information, the continuous expansion of markets, the deep technologization of war, and the acceleration of innovation, generally more technical and commercial than social. Genetic manipulation of human beings, the environmental crisis and climate change, artificial intelligence, the virtualization of social relations, the imaginaries of the subcultures of high technology and their dreams of downloading minds to computers and the cyborgization of the body, among so many other developments associated with techno-science, define the horizon for all those who made the transition into the twenty-first century and have to find answers within it. Philosophical and social thought on technology in the Portuguese language fully incorporates the international discussion of these issues, but there are different nuances and emphases in each of the Portuguese-speaking countries, linked to their specific continents and cultural and social contexts. Clear examples are the question of technological dependence, historical experience (particularly in Latin America and Africa) with the incorporation of Western technology into the social structure of ancestral communities and critical distancing on the inter-penetration of techno-science and economic globalization. But they all offer us thought-provoking reflections for the possible fertile interaction of philosophy and technology.","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy of Technology', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'History of Technology']"

When moving through a city in this way, we can see social imbalances, segregated spaces and neighborhoods, and changes in the landscape. Beneath what lies in plain sight lie mechanisms and regulatory apparatus. These include norms and socio-institutional structures that operate at different scales, from the local to the supranational. As we describe in this chapter, these influence urban dynamics beyond what our senses perceive directly. While we must take into account relationships between social agents, we must not overlook interactions between the agency itself and broader local, national, and international structures. Processes of capitalist globalization Globalizations , until 1970, unfolded mainly within the framework of nationally organized state States territorialities. More recently, these dynamics have changed and increased the importance of sub-national and supranational forms of territorial organization. This in turn has produced a process of rescaling and reterritorialization of capital and power. This is clearly reflected in the transfer of economic-policy authority and jurisdiction from states States to the scales mentioned above. In this chapter, we show that both state States territoriality and national governance are being redefined and deemphasized toward both wider and narrower scales. This makes up part of a neoliberal strategy to confront crises and be able to regulate capital accumulation more directly. We read the new role of local agency, as already signaled, on the basis of this diagnosis, and in a context of neoliberal rescaling. We recognize the value of forms of collective action, as well as that of the actors who, with a will toward transformation, have managed to reinvent their activity and delve into different forms of urban democratization Democratization .","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Public Policy']"

The existing gender inequalities will be exacerbated affecting women the most that stand at the intersection of such ascribed identities. “None of us will see gender parity in our lifetimes, and nor likely will many of our children.

Similar disease breakouts in the past have amplified gender implications, and thus the current pandemic will inexplicably affect women and girls. It is against this backdrop that this paper tries to look into the irrevocable impact of the pandemic on women’s health especially reproductive, sexual, and mental health concerns. Postponement and restrictions on essential maternal services, diversion of health resources, mental distress, and limitations of family planning services are some of the major concerns. It is crucial to underline the inherent nexus of health and gender inequality which is being amplified due to Covid-19 and will worsen it further.

As intimate strangers, they became part of neighborhood bars and shops, and became immersed in East German family life, despite governments’ attempts to maintain distance between the temporary international guests and the East German population. Chapter 5 argues that the workers’ social life of socialism vacillated between modes of inclusion and exclusion. It therefore focuses on human affective relationships ranging from romantic encounters and family formation to racist and xenophobic hate crimes, illustrating how the migrants carved out their own social spaces in an increasingly hostile environment. The first section explores the migrants’ integration and their intimate, cross-cultural relationships with East Germans and others. The second part examines how migrants experienced exclusion. The grounds were, variously, sexism, racism, xenophobia, and ethnic tensions. Integration and exclusion reflect two contrasting ends on the scale of human affective relationships, but the central theme of this chapter is how love and hate, intimacy and exclusion, and friendship and racism are intricately tied up with one another.","['History', 'World History, Global and Transnational History', 'African History', 'European History', 'Labor History', 'Migration']"

As explanatory factors of these mobilities, recent studies point to the constrained access to work, networks and institutions in the country of residence. The role of children in onward mobilities has received little attention thus far. While offspring are generally theorised as a ‘binding’ factor, research suggests that children can also be central in onward-mobility decision-making. Parents take children’s specific needs and their hopes for their children’s future into consideration within the decision of onward mobility. Children can also move on their own account or stay put while their parents move again. We present a case study to unveil the dynamics within Somali families around the decision to move onwards to the UK. This provides a rich and suitable case, because of the relatively high onward-mobility rates and the great variety in family composition and characteristics. Using a mixed-methods design, we develop, test and contextualise theoretical expectations concerning the relationship between the timing of arrival of children in the host country and their onward migration, with or without their parents. In addition, we empirically address the expectation that independent migration is more common in larger families. A comparison with other young people of refugee background is provided to shed light on the particularities and generalities of our findings.","['Social Sciences', 'Migration', 'Public Policy']"

This decade's desire for new goods, facelifts, and strategic product implementations tends to increase customisation and flexibility. With incremental depth, tool rotation, and traverse speed, this article's objective issue is formability assessment. A superior profile precision and supportive action are enhanced by numerical optimization technique. The output response was thinning, average-surface roughness, and geometric precision. Based on these findings, the meridional influence of rotational tool speed on marginal forming limit propagates localized streamline fracture initiation was studied in a series of studies. So as to gain relevant ideas to further research aspirant, correlation between all components of analysis established with relation and validated. The study results show that with reduced speed rate and incremental depth most suitable part quality can be obtained. In addition, spindle speed and feed rate show a significant contribution on forming force temperature.

Computational fluid dynamic simulations and experiments were carried out to investigate the performance of the micro-channel reactor under different design parameters. Through the combination of the numerical computational fluid dynamics simulations and the experiments, the performance of the micro-channel reactor was studied from the fluid flow characteristics (the fluid flow uniformity and the pressure drop) and the hydrogen production performance (the kinetics of the steam reforming reaction). The results indicated that the velocity uniformity coefficients in the inlet zones of the oxidizing side and the reforming side are high, the fluids inside the micro-channel reactor are uniformly distributed. The reaction to produce hydrogen from the methanol aqueous solution in the micro-channel reactor was simulated and tested, it indicated that the content of the reformed gas can meet the requirements. In addition, the temperature uniformity inside the micro-channel reactor was improved by adjusting the inlet temperature of the reforming side and the air volume of the oxidizing side.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering']"

The authors collected primary data (N = 225) from males and female employees in the private sector in Kuwait via SurveyMonkey and used the Structural Equation Modeling technique (SEM) to test the three study hypotheses. The study findings show that there is a positive and significant relationship between Wasta and favoritism. The findings also conclude that out of the three Wasta components (Mojamala, Hamola, and Somah), Mojamala is the most influential factor that causes favoritism. The findings contribute to the literature by developing a Wasta conceptual for the relationship between Wasta, favoritism. Understanding the concept of Wasta could benefit foreign investors to cope, succeed, and flourish without violating their codes of ethics and business laws in Western countries. In addition, a good understanding of Wasta helps foreign firms doing business in Kuwait be aware of the unseen hand of Wasta and take proactive steps.

Contemporary interpretations of financial capital include the extent to which both power and vulnerability can be managed by states (as for instance in recent asset-bubbling due mainly to the West’s 2009–2014 and 2020–2022 ‘Quantitative Easing,’ or the burst associated with 2022 economic sanctions against Russia, as cybercurrency autonomy loomed as a threat to central banks).

Also, it challenges the propensity of security studies to skip countries with different capabilities, even if they behave similarly.

This problem is interesting, in particular, in connection with dangerous convective phenomena in the lower atmosphere (heavy wind gusts, tornadoes). Heavy particles/objects carried by intense winds are one of the main hazards associated with such phenomena. The corresponding theoretical problems are complicated by the nonlinear dependence of the hydrodynamic resistance on the velocity of the particle relative to the medium, and were studied, as a rule, by numerical methods. The paper considers an analytical model that makes it possible to establish some general regularities of particle acceleration in the non-stationary flows. According to the solutions derived, the characteristic time of the acceleration of a particle during a fast intensification of the flow is an order of magnitude of the ratio of the particle settling velocity in the gravity field to the acceleration of gravity.","['Environment', 'Environmental Physics', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Water, general', 'Climate, general']"

This chapter identifies the European Commission’s approach to implementing RRI as a case of New Public Management, and contrasts this with efforts at ‘bottom-up’ RRI implementation. Experiments with involving researchers and other stakeholders in designing and executing concrete RRI actions that fit their professional setting are understood as manifestations of a New Public Governance approach to implementing RRI policy.

The impact response of multilayer structures is simulated using the equations of the generalized two-dimensional discrete structure theory. It is based on expanding all the components of the displacement vector of each layer into power series for the transverse coordinate. This theory takes into account all the components of the strain tensor in the layers and the spatial character of the strain of the multilayer structure close to the impact point. The impact of a ball with a homogeneous steel plate and a sandwich with a soft filler is considered. The paper also describes the experimental method for investigating the properties of materials under high deformation rate conditions. The specimens were investigated experimentally with a constant deformation rate. A pneumatic gun launches the projectile to cause tension of the specimen and dynamometer bar. The wideband strain gauge method is used to register their deformation. The true tension diagram of the material investigated is found from the equality of longitudinal forces in the specimen and dynamometer bar. The data obtained on the dynamometer bar are definitive ones for building this diagram, whereas the data obtained on the specimen are used for controlling the constancy of the specimen deformation rate. The strength properties of steel flat specimens were investigated under conditions of static and high-velocity loading. The strength parameters of the material are found to increase substantially with an increasing deformation rate.","['Energy', 'Energy Systems', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Structural Materials', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-17457-5_6,en,A Theoretical Investigation of the Impact of Blood-Endothelium Mechanical Interactions on the Cerebral Nitric Oxide Biotransport,OriginalPaper,"Cerebral nitric oxide (NO), a small diffusive molecule, plays a critical role in brain’s functionality. More precisely, NO acts as a neuro-glial-vascular messenger that aids various chemo-mechanical communications among brain cells, blood, and cerebral vasculature. A disequilibrium in the NO bioavailability and/or a delay in (or lack of) interactions of NO with other molecules due to, for instance, inflammation can lead to the onset and progression of cerebrovascular diseases. Mathematical models of cerebral NO biotransport can provide essential insights into mechanisms of cerebrovascular diseases that may lead to the development of better preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods. In this chapter, a two-dimensional space-fractional reaction-diffusion equation is proposed to model cerebral NO biotransport. The equation uses spatial fractional order derivatives to describe NO anomalous diffusion caused by the experimentally observed entrapping of NO in circulating endothelial microparticles. Cerebrovascular diseases cause an increase in the amount of endothelial microparticles and thus may lead to an enhanced anomalous diffusion of NO. The model includes the NO production by synthesis in neurons and by shear-induced mechanotransduction in the endothelial cells, and the loss of NO due to its interactions with superoxide and hemoglobin. The blood-endothelium mechanical interactions contribute to the shear-induced production of NO. Perturbation series solutions for the coupled blood-endothelium mechanics are adapted from literature for two cases: impermeable and permeable endothelium. Thus, the viscous dissipation at the blood-endothelium interface can be calculated analytically. The model generalizes a published one-dimensional model of cerebral NO anomalous diffusion in which the blood flow effect on the vascular wall was modeled as a mere oscillatory boundary condition. Numerical simulations suggest that for NO anomalous diffusion of fractional order 0.85 and in the presence of endothelial permeability and blood flow, the NO concentration at the endothelium increases in time which agrees with studies of stroke.","['Materials Science', 'Materials Science, general', 'Biomaterials', 'Structural Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

This work is related to determination of the finite life of low-carbon steel cylindrical notched specimens, which are subjected to fatigue loads in both with and without burnishing cases. This information can help to make the design more economical, maintainable, and reliable and thus avoid costly litigation, loss of life, sudden failure, etc. Analytical relation between impact stress and the fatigue life is obtained by power law. To verify the proposed relation, fatigue lives of low-carbon steel specimens have been observed on a tension-impact fatigue testing machine fabricated in the laboratory. The final expression between impact stress and fatigue life comes out in the form of Basquin’s law. The constants of this expression have been evaluated using least square approximation method. This work endeavors to find the damage done by the over stressing. The influence of surface finish on fatigue damage was investigated by ball burnishing process.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Materials Engineering']"

In this way, conceptions of learning and education are broadened to cover people’s knowledge building as life-deep, life-wide, and lifelong within broader community ecosystems. This educational imperative is global in scope. The first part of the chapter focuses on the increased connectivity and platformization of young people’s contemporary lives. Another part refers to the relevant aspects of a learning lives approach, which has also triggered methodological innovations regarding the ways of using digital technologies in collecting and analyzing data. The discussion will refer to some snapshots of empirical data from projects during the past decade to exemplify learning lives in transition and why this is an important educational imperative in contemporary societies. Implications will be drawn for in-service and preservice teacher education, as well as for further research orientations. The aim is to achieve a deeper understanding of learners and their learning in contemporary societies beyond the context of formal learning in the classroom.","['Education', 'International and Comparative Education', 'Education, general']"

Women are often saddled with the burdens of leading and providing for their families while their men take up the responsibility of fighting, with many losing their lives in the process. Many women and girls are abused in various ways including but not limited to sexual abuse, exploitation and violence. Theoretically, post-conflict reconstruction processes usually envisage the integration of vulnerable victims into the society. However, in reality, this is rarely the case. The objective of this paper is to differentiate between the jurisprudence of gender inclusion and gender mainstreaming in conflict reconstruction processes. The gender gaps in the initiatives were identified and recommendations are made on how to imbibe gender approach in all conflict peacebuilding and reconstruction programmes. The paper adopts a socio-legal interdisciplinary approach to analyse the legal framework of the conflict reintegration processes in the North-East region of Nigeria and determines the relationship of the frameworks with the wider societal needs.

In this chapter, a statistical gate sizing method is proposed to improve the lifetime reliability of manufactured chips in the presence of process variations and aging effects. To this end, we propose a canonical first-order delay model to estimate the delay degradation of a gate under negative-bias temperature instability (NBTI) and process variation (PV) while considering spatial correlations. Using the proposed gate delay model, a statistical static timing analysis method is introduced to compute circuit delay, taking into account the joint effects of process variation and NBTI. To guarantee that the circuit meets the required timing constraints, we propose an incremental gate sizing technique. This technique first computes the criticality of each gate, defined as the probability that a gate lies on the critical path due to NBTI and process variations. Then a group of gates with the highest ranking according to criticality is chosen for gate-sizing-based timing optimization. It is worthy to note that by using the proposed statistical gate delay model, we can compute the criticality of each gate incrementally.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems']"

Possible disincentive effects associated with share tenancy received much attention in the early theoretical literature and have later been scrutinized empirically with the availability of better data and better methods. With the development of better impact assessment methods and the experimental revolution in economics, land tenure reforms have increasingly also been assessed based on stronger data and better methods. However, using random treatments in such institutional reforms may neither be feasible nor recommendable in many cases. Still, experimental approaches may be used to investigate short-term impacts and help to reveal otherwise unobservable variables, such as risk preferences and trustworthiness, that affect land and labor contracts. With a good understanding of important contextual characteristics and new and better data, land tenure and land policies remain a vibrant and important area of research for applied economists. Rural transformation and adaptation to climate change put new pressures on rural factor markets and land tenure institutions in economies where shocks and pervasive market imperfections remain important challenges.","['Economics', 'Agricultural Economics', 'Development Economics', 'Development Studies', 'Agriculture']"

In this study, we study the effectiveness of both strategies under a unified framework. We test our hypotheses using residential development data from Hong Kong between 1995 and 2015. Empirical evidence shows that when the presale option is unavailable, developers tend to adopt the waiting strategy when facing price uncertainty risk. Conversely, when a presale option is available, developers will accelerate sales when price volatility is high. Moreover, the effectiveness of the presale option depends substantially on government restrictions. Our approach facilitates the identification of the net effect of either tool and provides an opportunity to unify conflicting findings in the literature.","['Economics', 'Regional/Spatial Science', 'Financial Services']"

As mentioned by the international Benchmark VeRCoRs, only very few teams were able to predict them and variations of at least one order of magnitude between participants were observed. Reinforced concrete tightness estimation is of the utmost importance for confinement vessels but also to assess concrete structures durability. One of the reasons for these difficulties lies in the fact that air leakage prediction is the last step of complex, multiphysics and coupled simulations. On the one hand, to predict concrete permeability, saturation evolution of the porous network needs to be correctly addressed. On the other hand, cracks predictions (numbers, openings, and appearance time) is essential but not sufficient since roughnesses, tortuosities and connectivities of these latter also strongly influence the leakage rate. After a first part showing the capacity of the used model to mimic the behavior of a structural representative volume, this contribution quantifies the effect of the use of autocorrelated random fields modelling the tensile strength on the concrete structural leakage prediction. The results highlight that the air leakage prediction can easily vary by one order of magnitude for the same random field parameters. Moreover, during mechanical loading, observation of the cracks evolutions (numbers, openings and positions) allows for quantifying the prevalence of material and structural heterogeneity and explains the sudden evolution of leakage rate.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Structural Materials', 'Sustainable Development', 'Mathematical Modeling and Industrial Mathematics']"

This four-node shell element has seven degrees of freedom (DOF) per node, namely three displacements, two rotations of mid-plane, and two transverse shear strain components. In the present work, Functionally Graded Cylindrical shell panels with simply supported and clamped boundary conditions, with various R / a ratios and with different volume fraction indices, are analysed for free vibration response. The property variation through the thickness is according to the power law. To assess the performance of the developed element, the results, of non-dimensionalised frequencies, are compared with the results presented in the literature. A comparison of results shows that the developed element yields quite accurate results with a coarser mesh, which leads to computational efficiency.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Construction Management', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering']"

In virtually all robotic applications it is required to somehow define a feasible and safe path, and such a problem can be cast and solved in many ways, given the several possible combination of robots—industrial robots, Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), underwater vehicles—and scenarios—a production line, a warehouse, an hazardous mountain—and therefore a large number of approaches and solutions have been, and are being, investigated. The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of such widespread literature, first by briefly recalling some classic and general-purpose methods used in path planning, then by focusing on some application-specific problems, related to AGVs in industry, medical robotics and robotic welding. This choice is motivated by the prominent relevance of the path planning problem in these three applications. Then, a single application of great industrial interest, such as robotic spray painting, is analysed. Its specific features are described, and several techniques for task modelling and path planning are considered. A detailed comparison among these techniques is carried out, so as to highlight pros and cons of each one, and to provide a methodology to choose the most suitable one for the specific robotic spray painting application.","['Engineering', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Engineering Design', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

The inclusion of refugee women and men has now moved beyond tokenistic and acknowledges their strengths, knowledge, and experience. The notion of ‘mainstreaming’ women, girls and gender into oblivion has been transformed into articulation of their different needs and capacities. With refugee activists and colleagues from around the world, we contributed to the recognition of the knowledge of refugees and the contributions they can make. These came to the fore during the COVID-19 pandemic. Refugee women have now taken a lead, and UNHCR and stakeholders around the world are responding.

Examples include understanding the interactions of uranyl(VI) with microorganisms, its absorption onto mineral phases, or the coordination chemistry with proteins on a molecular level. Analytical methods based on luminescence benefit from high sensitivity, good spatial resolution, and multiple output parameters (wavelength, intensity, lifetime) which can be used to locate uranyl(VI) at low concentrations and fingerprint local coordination environments. In this chapter, we discuss first the photophysical origins of the characteristically green uranyl(VI) emission, and its application in environmental fingerprinting and analysis. This is followed by a brief discussion of alternative indirect optical sensors, based on specific interactions between uranyl(VI) and another coloured or luminescent species. Both direct and indirect luminescence systems are discussed using select examples from the literature.","['Chemistry', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Optical and Electronic Materials', 'Optics, Lasers, Photonics, Optical Devices', 'Molecular Medicine', 'Medical Biochemistry']"

For concrete production, cement is the most important binding material, as its property is to bind both the coarse aggregate and fine aggregate when mixed with water. The title of the paper denotes that the terms brick kiln dust (BKD) and fly ash (FA) are the waste products, having some binding properties when mixed with water. The researcher’s attempt is to show how OPC 43 grade cement is partially substituted with FA and BKD combined together in the percentage of 0%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% during the production of concrete of design mix M25, and also to determine the compressive strength as per Indian Standards.

The static and dynamic characteristics of machine tools are improved by steel-reinforced epoxy granite. Topology optimization is a mathematical approach for optimizing the design space for a given set of objectives, loads, boundary conditions and constraints to maximize system performance. The present work focuses on optimizing the steel reinforcement configuration of a vertical machining centre column made of epoxy granite (EG). Topology optimization is carried out with the objective of maximizing the stiffness and natural frequencies of the steel-reinforced epoxy granite column while minimizing the mass of the structure. Multiple design configurations for steel reinforcement are evolved based on topology optimization, and numerical investigations are carried out by FEA. The static and dynamic characteristics of the EG columns with optimized steel reinforcements are compared with the existing CI and SREG columns. The results reveal an 8–20% improvement in natural frequencies and a 12% decrease in the mass of steel reinforcement than that of the existing SREG column.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Robotics and Automation']"

It is possible to achieve high competitive positions and ensure a high level of development of states and territories only if its economy adapts to the requirements of a modern consumer. Hereupon, the question arises: how to achieve territorial development and maximize the effect of mobilizing available resources? The answer to this question can be the creation of a new resource management system, which presupposes close interaction of the structures that own them. Transport investments also affect the economic development of regions since an established transport network ensures interregional and interstate interaction. Thus, we come to the creation of an investment and innovation system of the region, within which the investment and innovation potential of the territories are combined to achieve common goals. The formation of an investment and a transport investment innovation system is based on the existing principles of a systematic approach, for the greatest clarity of how it should work, a graphical model is created using the digraph method. The feasibility of forming an integrated investment and innovation system of the region is described by a mathematical function that reflects the effectiveness of its functioning.

The analysis of the communication system is carried out considering an extended version of the OSI stack that includes an additional layer placed below the Physical Layer (PL). In this further layer, called the Deep Physical Layer (DPL), the communication process is analyzed in terms of distinguishable electromagnetic field configurations on the receiving antenna. The DPL contains all the resources potentially available to the telecommunication system in terms of space/time/polarization field configurations, while the PL implements specific solutions to exploit the potential offered by the DPL. Such a potential is limited only by the physical laws, which are inviolable. Consequently, the limits imposed at the level of DPL are absolute. In this sense, the DPL is a more fundamental level than the PL. The numerous solutions proposed for 6G that include intelligent modifications of the propagation environment can be seen as “data processing” at the DPL level in order to preserve information lost in previous generations of communication systems.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Computer Communication Networks']"

While the concept, in its modern form, only emerged in the 1980s, Islamic teachings reinforced it since its inception through its rulings that aim to achieve justice and social welfare, reflected in Maqasid Al Shariah (objectives of Islamic rulings). In this paper, we look to explain further, through qualitative secondary research, the link between Shariah and sustainable development and evaluate if Islamic finance, which theoretically should be aligned with the concept of sustainable development given its basis on Shariah, is contributing to its attainment. We find that, while some efforts are being done by Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) to prove this view, IFIs largely lack today in fully aligning their activities with Maqasid Al Shariah which has been limiting their role in the attainment of sustainable development.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

It introduces the main argument of the book which is that protracted peace processes occupy a central position in the cycle of protractedness insofar as the policies, narratives, norms and practices associated with them have the double potential of affecting identities in conflict by promoting dehumanization or reconciliation. While the former is the dominating feature of othering in protracted conflicts, what tends to be reinforced by the interactions and new grievances sparked by protracted peace processes through time, their parallel and coexisting dynamics point to the appearance of empirically observable activities and practices that have emerged alongside—as a consequence—and within the very framework—as a desired outcome—of the protracted peace process. By exploring the dual process of dehumanization and peace-less reconciliation in ongoing conflicts, this chapter delineates the contribution of the book connected with the analysis of the conditions that have allowed for one process to prevail over the other, which points to avenues for positive conflict transformation.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'International Relations', 'Political Science and International Relations, general']"

The collaborative data action methodology was developed and refined over time based on the authors’ learning from multiple data projects. It features cycles of analysing, visualising and interacting with data. Since collaboration is recommended, the authors provide suggestions about where and how to find data collaborators. The last section explains the significance of responsible data governance, with two key concepts that underpin being able to re-use data optimally—data consent and ethics—particularly explored. While ethics and consent are relevant for all data projects, they are particularly salient when considering advanced projects, such as those involving data collaboratives.","['Social Sciences', 'Social Policy', 'Politics of the Welfare State', 'Social Work and Community Development', 'Comparative Social Policy', 'Sociology, general', 'Public Policy']"

While considering climate change a security issue, the military’s role in this discourse and praxis becomes critical as a security actor. However, the interrelationships between climate change, security and the military are conceived and approached by different states diversely. Within different states, this triangular relationship is guided by processes with varied practical/policy implications. While ‘securitization’ has generally been used to explain climate security, other processes such as ‘climatization’ have assumed significance, wherein security practices are climatized. The Indian military too has been engaging with security implications of climate change, but by using approaches distinct from Western states, which have been the usual focus in such analyses. In this paper, the framework of climatization is used to analyse the triangular relationship, using the case study of the Indian military—by categorizing climatizing moves as symbolic, strategic, precautionary and transformative.","['Social Sciences', 'Environmental Policy', 'Political Science and International Relations, general', 'Political Theory', 'Governance and Government', 'International Environmental Law']"

In the mainstream narrative of Dutch history, the period around 1800 constituted the birth of modern politics.

Based on an analysis of collective action in the 1780s and 1790s, I will argue in this chapter that in the Netherlands, like elsewhere, symbolic forms of action still loomed large during this period, and that, different from what has been assumed, the Batavian Revolution of 1795 did not produce a major rupture in this respect.","['History', 'European History', 'History of the Americas', 'World History, Global and Transnational History', 'Political History', 'History, general']"

It has been implemented by multiple advanced device modeling research groups in conjunction with multiple quantum transport methodologies. Industry has begun to adopt some of the advanced codes and is beginning to implement company internal versions. Commercial software vendors are adopting the methodologies and are beginning to deploy the approaches into their commercial TCAD products. Intense software development combining tight-binding with the non-equilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) Non-equilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) approach and quantum transmitting boundary method (QTBM) for quantum transport began in 1994 at Texas Instruments. Acceptance of NEGF and tight-binding began with wider adoption in about 2004. The past 25 years have resulted in many model advancements, numerical technology development, and physics exploration that is by far too large to be covered here comprehensively. We start by setting forth the requirements for realistic modeling of extended nanoscale devices (Sects. 45.1 and 45.2 ), which include a full quantum mechanical treatment, atomistic interface treatments, atomistic representations of crystal symmetries, polarization, strain, and bond directions, and embedding into macroscopic fields such as electromagnetic potentials and long-range strain. We then proceed to describe the essential definitions and features for empirical tight-binding (Sect. 45.3 ). Sections 45.4 , 45.5 , and 45.6 address numerical issues of tight-binding in terms of transfer matrices, Green’s functions, and parallel scaling. Section  45.7 is dedicated to several applications around quantum dots and nanowires. We highlight million-atom quantum dot simulations and focus on carrier transport though silicon nanowires. We demonstrate how effective masses and bandgaps become design parameters at the nanoscale, how heavy masses are desirable for end-of-roadmap transistors, and how coherent transport assumptions break down. The nanowire simulations can be duplicated by everyone on nanoHUB.org. Section  45.8 highlights the widespread use of tight-binding within nanoHUB applications.

Its outbreak and diffusion represented a veritable test for the Italian political system. When the pandemic crisis started, PM Giuseppe Conte headed a coalition government composed by the centre-left Democratic Party and the Five Star Movement. This was an untested and fragile coalition, governing a country in difficult economic conditions and under tight budgetary constraints. To provide a timely response to the pandemic crisis, decision-making was further centralised in the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, with Parliament entrusted, instead, with a marginal or at best reactive role. Yet, both tensions between levels of government—i.e., central government vs. regions—and within the government coalition constrained the effectiveness of executive action. Initially, the pandemic emergency was de-politicised. Its politicisation occurred later, when the crisis became less acute. In early 2021, however, the formation of a super grand coalition supporting the new PM Mario Draghi led to further de-politicisation. The rollout of the vaccination plan and the effective spending of the EU Recovery Funds were widely regarded as necessities leaving little space for party-political games.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Comparative Politics']"

An epistemology of fiction deliberately generates scientific statements that deviate from actual empirical reality. The chapter is structured according to three main purposes of fictional inquiry: (1) juxtaposing fictional and counterfactual statements with empirical reality to reveal new insights and enhance our understanding of that reality (e.g., through ideal-type thinking or figurative imagination); (2) juxtaposing fictional/counterfactual statements against other scientific statements to test and refine the latter statements (e.g., via counterfactual reasoning, thought experiments, or simulation); and (3) drawing on fictional realities as objects of inquiry in their own right, typically in order to understand the impact of these fictional realities on current or future (nonfictional) empirical realities. The chapter concludes with some considerations regarding the fit of an epistemology of fiction to management studies as an academic field.","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy, general', 'Business and Management, general', 'International Political Economy']"

We can’t predict every problem your project may encounter, but this chapter should provide you with a list of exception scenarios that might apply to your environment. You can select which you’ll need to handle and define a process for handling them. We recommend starting with the scenarios that are most likely as well as those that would have the biggest negative impact if they were to occur. We also suggest identifying in advance any log information necessary to help you handle the scenarios or records to keep to monitor your response to the events.

Since the creep problem is time-dependent, creep prediction of cementitious materials cannot be conducted directly by the micromechanics-based homogenization methods. Both Laplace-Carson transformation and the elastic–viscoelastic correspondence principle are required to transform the creep problem from the time domain to the elastic-like problems without time-dependent features in the Laplace-Carson domain. Based on the micromechanics-based homogenization scheme, the influence of the imperfect interface, the inclusion geometry, the damage condition, and the aging property on the creep development of cementitious materials can be quantified. It is shown that the imperfect interface has a significant effect on the overall creep of cementitious materials.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-13862-1_17,en,The Emergence of the Unprethinkable: On Schelling’s Methodology in 1821 and His Early Critique of Hegel,OriginalPaper,"Long before the famous notion of “unprethinkable being” is vastly used in Schelling’s later works, it is forged within his Weltalter project during the second decade of the nineteenth century. The first products of this process are given to the public in 1821 through Schelling’s inaugural lecture in Erlangen. The complete manuscript of Schelling’s lecture was first edited in 2020. The paper will specify the meaning of the unprethinkable for the methodology of Schelling’s philosophy. Against Hegel, Schelling sets the beginning of the system in the unprethinkable, a beginning that is always already there and therefore defying the claims of thought. As sheer possibility it undermines every being whatsoever. While in the later works the distinction between the negative and the positive philosophy is much clearer, the Erlangen Lectures struggle with the status of the negative and are struggling even more with achieving anything positive. Even though the goal of Schelling’s investigation is to deliver a positive notion of freedom, the system is always driven to negativity. Schelling frankly must admit that there “seems no way to escape the negative.” By following Schelling’s path through the development of the absolute, I will show how the negative consistently determines the positive. In the end, Schelling does not arrive at an absolute that is totally self-evident. On the contrary, the absolute he construes remains an ever changing, never resting force that keeps everything in motion. This result is not at all what Schelling had in mind for his system. As Jacobi would have reproached him, Schelling did get lost in nature, and did lose god on the way. But as Schelling would ever argue, while he found god within nature, his Erlangen Lectures still end in an absolute that is bigger than god and bigger than his system may describe. His conception of a two-part philosophy will be the attempt to answer the problem of a philosophy that exceeds itself. First, I will outline how Schelling understood the key notions of “system” and “absolute” in 1821, in order to understand the basis of the methodology of Schelling’s philosophy. Second, I will give some information on the rather not existing relation of Hegel and Schelling in 1820/1821, that still gives us information on their different approaches. Third, I will describe Schelling’s method as such and depict how the process Schelling develops consistently falls back into a form of negativity.","['Philosophy', 'German Idealism', 'Continental Philosophy', 'History of Philosophy']"

The design of mini/microreactor requires a thorough understanding of two-phase fluid flow behavior. In the present work, wall thickness and shape effects of mini-channels on irradiation behavior of infrared (IR) sensor during two-phase flow are experimentally studied. Based on the observations, a numerical model is developed using COMSOL Multiphysics package. The irradiation behavior of IR rays on test sections having various dimensional ratios and shapes (circular, square, and triangular) is analyzed for bubble and slug flow regimes with an IR transceiver circuit. Experiments are done in horizontal circular tubes of internal diameters—5.20, 3.50, and 2.50 mm and thickness—0.60, 0.60, and 0.30 mm, respectively, and a square channel of cross section—2 × 2 mm with 0.5 mm thickness. The size of the two-phase bubble and slug flow regimes recorded with high-speed photography employing image processing techniques is compared with change in current amplitude difference measured using infrared transceiver circuit. The results are in good agreement. The numerical model developed can be further used to design an array of IR sensors capable of detecting volumetric void fraction. .","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Solid Mechanics', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

Drawing on subsequent analyses, it is argued that this trend continues into our own day in spite of the neo-liberal attempt to restore the previous patterns of ownership and economic organisation. It is possible to suggest some of the ways in which the separation of ownership and control may be transforming socioeconomic relations, but there is as yet no full answer to a key problem posed by these developments: the lack of social control over large-scale enterprises.","['Economics', 'Social Choice/Welfare Economics/Public Choice/Political Economy', 'Political Economy/Economic Systems', 'History of Economic Thought/Methodology', 'European Politics']"

And this project has been further complicated by the political framework of “one country, two systems,” by which the capitalist special administrative region would continue to enjoy its autonomy under a socialist China for 50 years after 1997. Hong Kong people’s national identity remains a topic of ambivalence and dispute in spite of the handover as official efforts of enhancing nationalistic education often provoked skepticism and resistance. A number of studies have demonstrated the ideological bearings of the re-education project. Against the political storm surrounding a school-subject proposal made by the Hong Kong Government between 2010 and 2012, this chapter investigates the claims made by several groups of opponents in the city-wide campaign by elucidating their multiple and hyphenated identities and related values, as reflected in their campaign statements defending civic education and opposing national education. Interpretations of identity and patriotism are shown to be highly complex, differing even between opposition groups out of their particular roles. The opponents’ discourses reveal their overlapping and specific concerns with human rights, social justice, participation, autonomy, professionalism, pluralism, multiculturalism, children’s welfare, liberal education, and critical thinking. Their claims also provide a broader and nuanced account of citizenship and civic education. These pluralistic identities and values can be complementary when combating the official discourse. The findings can enrich our understanding of the specific nature, elements, and origins of the civic identity of Hong Kong people.","['Education', 'International and Comparative Education', 'Education, general']"

This island is one of the three islands, which is the National Tourism Strategic Area. The dominant livelihoods of residents are traditional fishermen, self-employment and tourism support activities. It is a natural thing if the port in the region is designed as a tourist port. Likewise, various risks are reviewed when submitting a plan for operating a tourist port, but they often do not involve the economic value of fishermen’s failure to catch fish. This is a gap that is considered important in this study. This study is the result of preliminary research from the Doctor Program thesis; the purpose of this study is a risk analysis that places fishermen in the common use of marine space as part of the risk forming components of a tourist port. The research method used “Cause and Effect Analysis”, which is a structured method to identify possible causes of risk. This method classifies the causes of risk into categories to facilitate identification. This study proves that the causes of risk formation from the low income of fishermen are water traffic, equipment and catch marketing, respectively. The detailed analysis shows that the synergy of the organization, schedules and services of the wharf and anchor grooves are the sub-cause of the risk.","['Energy', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Construction Management', 'Facility Management']"

The coded language of insects has been effectively decoded and used by Forensic Entomologists in solving homicidal cases. Forensic Entomologist can help to establish the post-mortem interval (PMI) of a body, geographic location of death, site of trauma and if the death has occurred due to poisoning or drug overdose. There are two ways of using insects in solving death cases: (a) Deciphering maggot age and development, (b) Insect faunal succession during different stages of decomposition. Calliphoridae (Blow flies), Sarcophagidae (Flesh flies) and Muscidae (House flies) of order Diptera (true flies) are the predominant species involved in forensic investigations. These flies possess the capability of finding a dead body within minutes following death. The flies immediately oviposit/larviposit on the carcass and larvae hatch within 12–24 h depending upon the temperature of the death scene. The larvae of these flies are voracious feeders and possess the capacity as well as capability to consume a carcass in less than a week. The close association of these immature stages on a carcass, their development rates are tapped by the forensic experts to solve homicidal cases. The carcass during decomposition undergoes rapid physical, chemical and biological changes, and attract varied groups of insects. Certain species prefer the carcass during early period of decomposition, like the true flies, some prefer the dead body during its decay or dry stage (beetles, ants) and some arrive to feed on insects present on the corpse. Therefore, with the knowledge about regional insect fauna, their succession pattern of colonization, the insect assemblage on carrion is used by an expert to calculate the minimum time since death. Besides, different groups of insect species assemblages are found on decomposing carcass in different habitats and environments. Apart from calculating Post-Mortem Interval (PMI), with the knowledge of geographical distribution of insect species, an expert can determine whether the body has been moved from one geographic location to the other. Furthermore, the insect larval forms found on a carcass could be tested for death due to drugs or poisoning as the larvae feed on flesh and accumulate drugs ingested by a deceased person. Forensic Entomology is a fast-emerging field in forensic sciences and has become an added tool in legal investigations in the developed countries. Considering the applicability of this field, it becomes imperative that this branch of forensic sciences should be encouraged, popularized, and recognised in the developing countries as well.","['Life Sciences', 'Zoology']"

The nineteenth-century struggles of the non-enfranchised groups have been understood, under T. H. Marshall’s inspiration, as quests for inclusion, in a double loop that would encompass access to the status of citizenship and emancipation from different forms of tutelage: servitude, patronage, wage system, imperialism and male domination. From this perspective, the history of politics presumes a narrative of modernisation in which successive waves of inclusion, mainly through the expansion of suffrage rights, build up democracy. This is a powerful theme that serves to make sense of some aspects of our collective history, but at the same time, it projects a shadow over many political experiences of conflict and participation in the recent past which cannot be understood as struggles for inclusion or emancipation. The teleological narrative imposes a retrospective agenda over history that obscures the many potential futures that were at play in the conflicts and struggles of the past. It also puts at the centre of the narrative a selection of supposedly forward-looking actors and political projects—the bourgeoisie, the working class, liberalism and nationalism—and tends to disregard the weight and potential influence of groups and individuals that are cast, often without due care, as mere relics of the past.","['History', 'Social History', 'Political History', 'European History', 'Modern History', 'World History, Global and Transnational History']"

We can generate complex signals through simple signals, just as we can construct a building using basic components. It is necessary to determine the main signals. Once we determine the main signals, we can generate more complex signals from these main signals. The first of the main signals is the sinusoidal signal. The sinusoidal signal can be obtained using a bipolar magnet and copper wire. The signal obtained in this way is an electrical signal. It is possible to obtain the DC voltage signal from the sine voltage signal by means of rectifiers. It is also possible to obtain square wave, impulse, and very narrow-spaced rectangular (impulse array) wave sequences by means of electrical circuits. An exponential voltage wave is observed during the discharge of the capacitor on the resistor. Once we have the fundamental waves, we can create other more complex waves.

This chapter aims to present various approaches to blending strategies and to discuss the physical and chemical limitations of polymer blending, and structure-property relationships can yield bioplastics as viable materials.","['Materials Science', 'Biomaterials', 'Nanotechnology', 'Environmental Chemistry']"

Technological innovation and advancements have benefited a multitude of global industries. However, the benefits from disruptive technology are yet to be realised in the real estate industry. As such, the emergence of the global e-commerce industry positions the industrial sector ideally for technological adoption, specifically within the distributive warehousing and logistics sub-markets. Facilities management (FM) itself is further ideally placed within this framework to necessitate this change given its services and operational functions. This paper documents the findings of an investigation into the effect of disruptive technologies on FM within the context of the industrial sector. The findings show that the impact of disruptive technology can be disaggregated into two stances, namely: the cautious stance where little impact is occurring; and the open stance where significant impact is occuring. The nature of the different stakeholders gives rise to a variety of perspectives on the implementation of technology. Property-owning companies were more inclined to choose labour as a solution over technology as in South Africa labour proves to be a cheaper alternative than the capital required to incorporate and maintain technology. The paper concludes that although the industrial sector is experiencing the implementation of disruptive technologies the industry is still lagging behind the developed world. Not much will change in this regard as long as labour costs are cheaper than technological installations, or property owners are forced to adopt technology in order to remain competitive.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Sustainable Development', 'Construction Management']"

Jaky’s semi-empirical formula is considered to be a sufficiently precise relationship for practical purposes, although its derivation includes some arbitrary approximations. Alternatively, granular mechanics may be used to obtain a rational relationship between these two quantities, based on the assumption that stresses are transmitted as conjugated chains of forces along the edges of an octahedral lattice. Two experimental extreme conditions of an infinite soil slope are considered: the state at rest, when its inclination is zero, and the plastic state, when its inclination equals the friction angle. Eliminating the angle of the assemblage of grains, a relationship between K 0 and the angle of friction is directly achieved in a very simple way. As shear stresses are forbidden in the direction of the ground level lines, there are only two admissible positions of the base of the octahedral lattice: the diagonal and the parallel to the slope, which are related to the triaxial and biaxial compression tests, respectively. The relationships thus obtained are supported by the experimental data reported by several authors.","['Engineering', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Offshore Engineering']"

Theorizing Corporate Governance and Financial Power,OriginalPaper,"Hilferding’s work provides important theoretical foundations for a much-needed ‘Institutional Marxist’ theory of corporate governance. By tracing the evolution of state and corporate organization since the late nineteenth century, this chapter illustrates that such a theory constitutes a key basis for the periodization of capitalist development. Drawing on Hilferding’s theorization of ‘finance capital’ as a fusion of financial and industrial capital dominated by money-capital, it is suggested that the restructuring of capitalism since the 2008 crisis has led to the emergence of a ‘new finance capital.’ Through a process linking the internal restructuring of ‘non-financial’ corporations with new forms of concentration and centralization of finance across the economy, new institutional linkages between finance and industry have been consolidated, constituting a new organizational form of corporate power.

The macroscopic mechanical properties and microscopic quantities affected by the normalized interface roughness and the loading parameters are analyzed. The macro-response shows that the shear strength of the interface increases as the normalized roughness of the interface increases, and stress softening and the dilatancy of the soil material are observed in the tests with rough interfaces. The particle-scale analysis illustrates that a localized band with intense shear deformation emerges from the contact plane and expands gradually as shearing progresses before stabilizing at the residual stress state. The thickness of the localized band is affected by the normalized roughness of the interface and the normal stress, varying between 4 and 5 times the median grain diameter. A thicker localized band is formed when the soil has a rough shearing interface. After the localized band appears, the granular material structuralizes into two regions: the interface zone and the upper zone. The mechanical behavior in the interface zone is representative of the interface according to the local average stress analysis. Certain microscopic quantities in the interface zone are analyzed, including the coordination number and the material fabric. Shear at the interface creates an anisotropic material fabric and leads to the rotation of the major principal stress.","['Engineering', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Civil Engineering']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-21065-5_8,en,Control and Stability of an Aerial Manipulator Depending on the Inertial Parameters,OriginalPaper,"Control and stabilization of aerial manipulators is a challenging problem due to the effects of the relative movements of the arm and aerial platform on the dynamics. In many cases, conventional multirotor controllers and autopilots are based on the cascaded structure of underactuated mechanical systems, and consider these effects as perturbations. This control scheme, which controls the arm and the aerial platform as two separated systems, is known as decoupled control scheme. In practice, the success of this approach will depend on the design and movements of the arm. This paper presents the analysis of the control performance and stability of an aerial manipulator with a decoupled controller for different speeds of movement and inertia moments of the manipulator arm. The aerial manipulator consists of a hexarotor and a 2-DoF manipulator arm with variable length links. The arm was built in this way to change its inertia, so it may be representative of a widely class of arms used in aerial manipulation. The proposed aerial manipulator has been analysed in simulation tests for two representative tasks. For both cases, the stability limits of the system, represented as stability maps , are identified as a function of the inertial design and the typical velocities of the arm movements. These stability maps are validated through experiments. This analysis will be useful to guide the inertial design of the arm and to define the envelope of arm movements for safe operation.","['Engineering', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Robotics']"

Plastic products release different types of additive materials in environment during decomposition process. Recent studies show that leaching of additives from plastic products is great matter of concern as they are persistent, bioaccumulative in nature, and highly toxic to biota. Among these added materials, flame retardants (FRs) possess critical virulent effects on aquatic life and human beings. FRs are synthetic chemicals widely used in consumer products to increase their ignition resistance property. Different types of FRs are utilized in plastic industry such as organohalogen, organophosphate, metal (aluminum)-, and nitrogen-containing FRs. The organohalogen FRs now a days are the most preferably used FRs because of low coast, competence, and good performance. Among organohalogen, brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are widely used in consumer products. Several traditional BFRs (e.g., polybrominated diphenyl ether [PBDE]) have been included in the list of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and their utilization is restricted due to their known toxicity and persistence nature. Over the past few years, these compounds have been replaced with “new” BFRs (NBFRs). In spite of the fact that chemical structure of NBFRs and traditional BFRs are different but they share most of the physical-chemical properties (substitution of halogen atom and solubility in fat) which are similar to both groups; therefore, their outcome in environment is possibly similar to the restricted BFRs. Due to their potential toxicity to humans and organisms, as well as persistent and bioaccumulative nature, their complete removal (including real-time analysis, rules, and regulations) or transformation into another useful product is highly crucial. In this way, traditional techniques such as photocatalysis, thermal degradation, adsorption, and anaerobic degradation were employed. Recently, nanomaterials (including metal, metal oxide, and nanocomposites) with small size and high surface area emerge as the most economic, rapid, and effective photocatalysts under artificial and sunlight irradiation, also used for debromination of BFRs by using different mechanisms. The current chapter brings out readers with broad information on problem related with traditional BFRs and NBFRs (classification, consumption, environmental concentration, and need for different degradation techniques) and their removal using nanoparticles (NPs) through adsorption, photocatalysis, reductive, and oxidative debromination. Furthermore, significance of green synthesized NPs in the degradation of BFRs has future scope.","['Materials Science', 'Nanotechnology', 'Sustainable Development']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-030-79827-7_39,en,Spherical Harmonics Expansion and Multi-Scale Modeling,OriginalPaper,"By far, most numerical device simulations are still based on the drift-diffusion (DD) model, owing to its versatility, numerical efficiency, and robustness. However, the DD model is of limited physical accuracy for nanoscale devices and hot carrier effects. Advanced physical modeling in the regime of semi-classical transport must therefore be based on the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), and the typical solution method for this equation is a Monte-Carlo (MC) algorithm owing to its small memory requirements. Unfortunately, this popular solution method makes the BTE model much less versatile than the DD approach, as, for example, no AC and noise analysis in the small-signal framework based on the Jacobian of the numerical model is available if the MC method is used. Moreover, evaluating the complete transport of carriers in a device by the BTE model is always several orders of magnitude less efficient in terms of CPU time than the application of the DD model. Thus, there is a clear demand to increase the versatility of the BTE model and to enhance the physical accuracy of the DD model without compromising its numerical efficiency and robustness. Solving the BTE model with the spherical harmonic expansion (SHE) method allows the calculation of the full Jacobian of the discrete system and to establish AC and noise analysis in the small-signal framework, thus making the BTE model much more versatile. Moreover, sequential and concurrent multi-scale methods using microscopic models such as the BTE model where necessary and macroscopic models such as the DD model otherwise are well suited to enhancing the physical accuracy of the DD model without compromising its efficiency and robustness. In addition, using the SHE method allows many of the discretization methods and principles previously developed for the DD model to be applied for the discretization of the BTE model. Therefore, a short overview of the historic development of discretization methods and principles, finally making the DD model as efficient and robust as it is today, is added as well.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Electronic Circuits and Devices', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation']"

The methodology presented in this work allows the construction of a part of the kinetic law of fracture of polymers, the one that reveals the brittleness of the polymer. The fracture energy of the material is estimated by taking into account the cracking regime and thus the potential inertial effects induced during the rapid propagation of cracks in the case of brittle behavior. Polyamide-11, a polymer used for the manufacture of hydrogen tank liners, is studied. A decrease in fracture energy is observed between the initiation resistance and the fast propagation resistance. This is referred to as polymer embrittlement. Electron microscopy analysis of fracture surfaces in three different zones (initiation, propagation, arrest) has revealed the mechanisms responsible for the ductility of the polymer in quasi-static regime and its brittleness in dynamic regime.","['Materials Science', 'Materials Science, general', 'Biomaterials', 'Structural Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

The availability of enormous datasets, as well as recent advancements in deep learning methods, are allowing AI systems to perform at or even beyond the level of human performance on an expanding variety of challenging tasks. However, because of their layered non-linear structure, these strong models have traditionally been regarded as “black boxes,” since they provide no information about how they arrive at their predictions and hence cannot be used trustily to generate predictions. They are often opaque, but they are capable of making accurate predictions that cannot be explained in any other way. All of these choices are having an increasing amount of effect on the lives of individuals. The distrust of totally non-human, autonomous artificial intelligence systems is established as the cornerstone of the movement. The root of distrust lies in a lack of knowledge as to why intelligent systems make certain decisions in certain situations. As a result, this problem has sparked a fresh discussion over explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Several lines of research work have since picked up on the definition, understanding, and implementation of explainability, including expert systems, machine learning, recommender systems, and approaches to neural-symbolic learning and reasoning, all of which have occurred primarily during different periods in the history of artificial intelligence.

How the strain localization accumulates and develops to form the shear band is crucial in explaining some significant constitutive behaviors of the soil-structural interface (SSI) during shearing, for example, stress hardening, softening, and shear-dilatancy. Using DEM simulation, interface shear tests with a periodic boundary condition are performed to investigate the shear-banding process in densely and loosely packed granular soils. Based on the velocity field given by grains’ translational and rotational velocities, several kinematic quantities are analyzed during the loading history to demonstrate the evolution of strain localization. Results suggest that tiny concentrations in the shear deformation have already been observed in the very early stage of the shear test. The degree of the strain localization, quantified by a proposed new indicator, α , steadily ascends during the stress hardening regime, dramatically jumps prior to the stress peak, and stabilizes at the stress steady state. Loose specimen does not develop a steady shear band at the large strain, as the deformation pattern transforms between localized and diffused failure modes. During the stress steady state of both specimens, remarkable correlations are observed between α and the shear stress, as well as between α and the volumetric strain rate.","['Engineering', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Civil Engineering']"

The experimental model is a span-wise three-section force measuring model, and the force measure is only performed in the middle section of the model to reduce the influence of the sidewall interference of the wind tunnel. In the experiment, the transient angle of attack of the model is collected, the inertial force and pitching moment on the middle section of the model are calculated, and the data collected from the balance is subtracted to correct the influence of the model's inertia on the results. The results show that the angle of attack exceeding the positive or negative static stall angles of attack is a necessary condition for the lift and pitch moment coefficients to produce a large hysteresis loops. As the oscillation reduced frequency increases, the dynamic stall is delayed, the lift coefficient hysteresis loop increase, the drag coefficient increase, and the pitch moment coefficient near the maximum angle of attack decrease. When the angle of attack is less than the static angle of attack of stall or exceeds a small range, with the increase of the reduced frequency of the airfoil oscillation, the pitch moment coefficient of the airfoil decreases when it goes up and increases when it goes down. With the increase of the oscillation amplitude, the hysteresis loops of both dynamic lift coefficient and pitching moment coefficient of the oscillating airfoil increase. As the average angle of attack increases, the angle of attack of airfoil enters the positive stall zone more, the lift coefficient hysteresis loop increases, and the minimum pitch moment coefficient decreases. The Reynolds number has no obvious effect on the hysteresis loop of lift, drag and pitch moment coefficients; however, in the downward process, as the Reynolds number increases, the lift recovery advances, and the hysteresis loop decreases.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

Future climate change scenarios predict an increase in wildfire activity such as increases in fire extent, severity or frequency in many ecosystems. Fuel management is the primary means for land and fire managers to reduce the risk from future fires. There are multiple fuel management strategies used, with varying levels of effectiveness. In this chapter, we discuss mitigation strategies for wildfire in the context of fuel management, with a primary focus on reducing the impacts to people and property. We consider a range of different fuel management strategies, including prescribed fire, mechanical treatments, grazing and landscaping. We provide an overview of the known evidence-base for the efficacy of each strategy in terms of their influence on three key elements of wildfire risk: the likelihood of ignition; spread to the Wildland-Urban Interface, and impacts at the Wildland-Urban Interface. Finally, we discuss fire risk mitigation strategies under a changing climate. No single solution will achieve all stated objectives alone. Fire managers need to consider where and when it is appropriate to apply the various fuel management actions in order to achieve the greatest risk reduction across a range of values. They also need to consider whether the risk reduction benefit is outweighed by the harm it may do to human health or to environmental values.","['Engineering', 'Fire Science, Hazard Control, Building Safety', 'Environmental Health', 'Climate Change/Climate Change Impacts']"

The decisive phenomenon is one of increasing indifferentiation between archive and life, between action already taken and action to be done, between the ephemeral and the enduring. This essay problematizes the archive at the moment of its digital and electronic transformation. Beyond preservation or reproduction of the remains or fragments of an action already completed, the archive seems to be concerned with the “first principleness” of experience, but also with the materiality on which all action is based. This formulation suggests something disturbing. An archival mediality, only effective through an immediate connectivity, presents a state of traceability (and repetition) of everything.","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy of Technology', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'History of Technology']"

Due to the fine microstructures generated by the high cooling rates, the tensile strength is improved, whereas the fatigue strength is comparable or even reduced. This is due to the presence of process-induced defects formulated during the manufacturing process in combination with the increased notch and mean stress sensitivity of high-strength metals. The damage evolution, including crack initiation and propagation, may be determined concerning fatigue stress and lifetime using modern measurement techniques before, during, and after fatigue testing. This will lead to a deeper understanding of the characterization of AM metals and how different variants and parameters can affect the fatigue behavior. Through this paper, three different AM alloys (AlSi10Mg, 316L and TNM-B1) are studied with respect to how the process-induced defects can affect the fatigue lifetime and resulting scattering and how the fatigue damage tolerance can be uniformly represented.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Engineering Design']"

Trained by Johann Pestalozzi and influenced by Jean Jacques Rousseau, Froebel helped to lay the foundation for modern education with his educational tome, Education of Man (1826). His writings have influenced how childhood is viewed and valued as he emphasized the unique needs and capabilities of young children. He advocated for a child-centered approach to learning and that play was fundamental in supporting children’s learning and development. He introduced the gifts (block play) and occupations (hands-on activities and songs), which were designed to support children’s autonomous learning, and remain key activities in contemporary early childhood education. At a time when women could not vote, Froebel advocated for women by championing their intellect and for their right to work outside the home as teachers of young children. He created training centers and supported women’s role in education as necessary. This led to women becoming agents of change for their gender, which ultimately led to female access to capital, informal and formal female networks, and a measure of authority. Ultimately, Friedrich Froebel is a chief architect of modern early childhood education and, almost 200 years later, his contributions remain present in early childhood classrooms.","['Education', 'Educational Philosophy', 'History of Education', 'Education, general', 'International and Comparative Education', 'Administration, Organization and Leadership', 'Sociology of Education']"

In the Mediterranean welfare regime, care is supposed to be granted by the family, and LGBTQ partners, mothers and friends are not legitimized in their desire to have more than one intimate relationship at a time, to parent and to live a satisfactory life beyond the couple. Therefore, through the subversive and transformative power of friendship, LGBTQ people question relational normativity, blur the boundaries of intimate relationships and redefine care.

He viewed his own efforts as an educator and public servant as an extension of his calling to the priesthood but he did not believe those efforts were the sole province of priests. Much of his life was thus spent empowering laypersons to serve in such capacities including the transferal of Notre Dame’s own board to laypersons and admission of women to its undergraduate program. In order to protect the diffusion of power he believed he was called to offer, he occasionally found it necessary to exercise that leadership in ways that differed from figures serving in locales such as the White House (e.g., while serving as chair the Civil Rights Commission) and the Vatican (e.g., while serving as president of the International Federation of Catholic Universities).","['Education', 'Religion and Education', 'Administration, Organization and Leadership', 'Higher Education']"

I will argue that there are two ways in which the climatization of the military discourse operates. First, it leads to a reframing of existing security narratives such as migrations or armed conflicts through a climatic lens, which creates a sense of urgency and intensity. Second, the climatization of the military discourse is mediated by a riskification of climate change, through the adoption of a risk-based approach to prevent its security implications. It creates a sense of uncertainty and leads to the climatization of a growing number of security issues such as terrorism or illegal fisheries. Both processes contribute to legitimize military solutions in global climate governance and expand the scope of intervention of the armed forces.","['Social Sciences', 'Environmental Policy', 'Political Science and International Relations, general', 'Political Theory', 'Governance and Government', 'International Environmental Law']"

We begin by conceptualizing the state, adopting a strategic-relational approach that allows us to overcome the structure-agency division and to understand the state as a complex relationship. We situate this theoretical reflection within the study of neoliberalism as a form of governmentality, offering an approach that is not limited to the field of economics. Neoliberalism is driven by states, through states, and develops within states themselves. Therefore, on a more concrete level, we analyze the most direct consequence of neoliberalism: the privatization of democracy. While this model does strategically reinforce private institutions and actors, it is also necessary to study the resistance and alternative proposals for democratization that arise in response. We analyze the case of Basque majority unionism to draw attention to democratization strategies employed by subjects formerly included in the “power bloc” and subsequently expelled in the post-Fordist era. We conclude that one strategy for democratization is based on a re-territorialization of power through public institutionalization, including not only the subjects and classes more recently excluded from power through neoliberal governmentality, but others that were not central in other forms of governmentality either. We call this strategy “communitarian statism.”","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Public Policy']"

Lastly, it examines the economic and geopolitical context. In the second part of the chapter, the lens shifts from the policies to those affected by those policies. Based on oral history interviews with migrants, I examine their complex reasoning for signing up for the labor migration programs. Angolan and Mozambican migrants to East Germany were as much educational migrants, war migrants, and aspirational migrants as they were labor migrants. Demonstrating the complexity of the bottom-up perspective of this migration, I argue that exploring migrants’ multiple, overlapping, and fluid motives challenges prevailing concepts of socialist migrants as passive participants, as well as stagnant definitions of labor migration.","['History', 'World History, Global and Transnational History', 'African History', 'European History', 'Labor History', 'Migration']"

Despite government avowed commitment towards improved accountability, the South African state continues to be drenched in the state capture crisis. This chapter is shaped by one of the critical and identified APRM political governance objectives. Specifically, the chapter critiqued, the extent to which the South African state has and is ensuring its public office holders and civil servants are both accountable and efficient in the delivery of services. Thus, within the South African context, this chapter examines the key issues to improving public service accountability and efficiency. Furthermore, best practice was identified with a view of highlighting what works to enable sharing of insights with other African countries, but also, where challenges remain, these were analysed, and opportunities for practice improvement were spelt out in the form of recommendations offered. Thus, this chapter provides significant insights to strengthen the South African state’s ability to improve public service efficiency and accountability.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'African Politics', 'Comparative Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Public Policy', 'Electoral Politics', 'Public Administration']"

Unfortunately, conventional CMOS data converters trade off speed, power, and accuracy. Therefore, they are exhaustively customized for special purpose applications. Furthermore, intrinsic real-time and post-silicon variations dramatically degrade their performance along with the technology downscaling. Using machine learning techniques and neuromorphic computing, these issues can be overcome. This chapter presents four-bit neuromorphic analog-to-digital (ADC) and digital-to-analog (DAC) converters using memristors that are trained using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm in real-time to autonomously adapt to different design and application specifications, including multiple full-scale voltages, sampling frequencies, number of resolution bits, and quantization scale. Theoretical analysis, as well as simulation results, show the collective resilient properties of our converters in application reconfiguration, logarithmic quantization, mismatches calibration, noise tolerance, and power optimization. Furthermore, large-scale challenges are discussed and solved by leveraging mixed-signal architectures, such as pipelined ADC. These ADC and DAC designs break through the tremendous speed-power-accuracy tradeoff in conventional data converters and enable a general-purpose application architecture with valuable results for neuromorphic computing.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Electronic Circuits and Devices', 'Processor Architectures', 'Nanotechnology', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation']"

Finally, it was even a relevant point in the coalition treaty from the Federal Governing Parties in the year 2018. It is a unifying theme for safety measures taken on the federal, state, and local levels and in private, nonprofit traffic safety organizations. In later years, cooperation between these different agents has been intensified. Evaluation and measurability are essential in the German approach to Vision Zero. One example of this is the statistical work performed every year to identify “zero cities,” i.e., cities that had zero road fatalities the previous year. A yearly award puts focus on cities that have a particularly long string of zero years, in relation to their size. This is performed on an international level, and cities around the world are incentivized by these recognitions. Munich is used as an example of a city that has recently stepped up its traffic safety work. The city has adopted Vision Zero and followed up this with intensified traffic safety work, including improved data collection, the identification of accident black spots, targeted measures to improve safety in these black spots, safety audits of new infrastructure plans, etc. Before the introduction of new traffic technologies which may have an impact on safety, in-depth technology assessment has to be performed. This is illustrated by an example in which sufficient prior technology assessment did not take place, namely the introduction of e-scooters in Germany. After their introduction, they have turned out to be significantly more dangerous than bicycles, as can be seen from the statistics of fatalities and severe injuries. Proposals are made for measures are needed to reverse this trend, including obligatory use of helmets. The dialogue with neighbor states is also essential. Here the Traffic Expert Society of Medical and Technical Biomechanics, gmttb (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland= D A CH), has initiated to discuss and bundle basic principles of the Vision Zero in three neighbor countries. To promote Vision Zero, gmttb also organizes interdisciplinary yearly conferences with experts from Austria (Vision Zero is a state philosophy) and Switzerland (here named Via Sicura) to bundle strength and adopt ideas together with Swedish and multinational experts. As well as a yearly gmttb Vision Zero Safety Award is granted to motivate people, organizations, and manufacturers to promote good ideas for better traffic safety.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Policy', 'Health Policy', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Innovation/Technology Management', 'Social Policy']"

Two major earthquake-related events in Malaysia are the 5.9 magnitude earthquake in Ranau and the tsunami that struck Perlis, Kedah, Penang, and Perak due to the 8.9 magnitude earthquake in Acheh. These incidents had caused numbers of casualties and millions in property losses. This study aims to determine the challenges and solutions in adhering to earthquake design regulations from consultants’ perspectives. The data is collected from consultants through open-ended interviews and analyzed using thematic analysis. The study findings suggest that the challenges in adhering to earthquake design regulations are increased cost to projects, the reluctance of key personnel to the regulation, and enforcement. On the other hand, the potential solutions for these challenges are reviewing the current earthquake design regulation, mandating the regulation, and increasing the exposure of the regulation. Local authorities can use these findings to foresee the challenges and solutions to improve the implementation of earthquake design regulations in Malaysia.","['Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences']"

This chapter analyses and design FBMC-OQAM waveform based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and multi-user massive MIMO systems. It begins by describing key features and differences of FBMC waveform over the widely popular OFDM waveform, followed by the discussion over key challenges in designing FBMC based MIMO and massive MIMO systems. A semi-blind (SB) channel state information (CSI) estimation scheme, which enhances the performance with a limited pilot overhead, is developed for MIMO-FBMC system along with its Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for benchmarking the performance. To compare the performance of FBMC and OFDM waveforms in the uplink transmission, the achievable sum-rates are derived for multi-user (MU) massive MIMO technology relying on FBMC waveform with maximum ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers. The corresponding power scaling laws for MU massive MIMO-FBMC are also found. It is shown that in practical impairments such as carrier frequency offset, massive MIMO-FBMC systems significantly outperform their OFDM counterparts.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Computer Communication Networks']"

The strength and ductility of a concrete column increase after FRP jacketing mainly because of concrete’s improved behaviour under confinement. To achieve a reliable retrofit design, engineers often need to understand how much the performance is improved after FRP jacketing. For that purpose, numerical modelling is often necessary. The success of finite element analysis depends on an accurate concrete constitutive model and therefore, to capture confinement changes within a finite element model, concrete multi-axial behaviour needs to be adopted. Phenomenological elastic-plastic-damage models are widely used for the numerical modelling of concrete because of their capability of representing 3D concrete behaviour considering permanent inelastic deformations as well as degradation of material moduli beyond the elastic range. This paper aims to implement an elastic-plastic-damage model to simulate FRP-jacketed concrete columns. The material model is validated against existing experimental data and comparisons with the results of models developed in ABAQUS software. It is shown that the proposed modelling approach is capable of providing an accurate behaviour of square concrete columns confined with reinforcements and FRP jackets under compression. After the validation of the model, a parametric study was conducted to illustrate the effect of partial wrapping on the behaviour of retrofitted columns.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

In The Sense of the World (1997), the chapter discovers the source of Nancy’s dark vision to be the author’s pain at the suffering of humanity and his claim that the curtain has fallen on metaphysics, including Christianity. On Nancy’s analysis of Kant’s third Critique , the chapter charges that Nancy is looking in the wrong place for the core of the Critique , in which the non-cognitive, aesthetic judgment is only a stepping-stone. Lastly, the chapter scours Caputo’s radical hermeneutics for key principles of postmodern interpretation theory, only to find Caputo’s challenge to metaphysics to be disappointingly empty, in contrast with his appreciation of Derrida’s deconstruction as disruptive liberation and Rorty’s anti-essentialism.

To implement these principles, the authors suggest a mathematical description of the UEP elements, tools that support the principles of its development and optimization method of successive processes between subsystems of different decomposition-based information communication systems (ICS). As an example, the paper describes global business process formation for the different ICS and their subsystems. The suggested components that are functioning together guarantee full remote access to environmental data stored in different physically distributed systems.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

doi:10.1007/978-981-19-4293-8_24,en,Effects of Rock Mass Deterioration Induced by Wetting-Drying Cycles on Slope Stability of Reservoir Banks,OriginalPaper,"In view of the degradation of the rock mass mechanical parameters of the reservoir bank slope fluctuation zone caused by rainfall and the rise and fall of the reservoir water level, the moderately weathered sandstone of a slope in the Three Gorges reservoir area was selected as the research object. The “saturated” sandstone was subjected to Brazilian split test, uniaxial and triaxial compression tests. The test results show that the mechanical parameters of sandstone in the “dry” state are greater than those in the “saturated” state under the same number of dry-wet cycles ( n ); The uniaxial compressive strength, elastic modulus, tensile strength, cohesion, and internal friction angle of sandstone decrease logarithmically with the increase of n , and the Poisson’s ratio increases with the increase of n . The effects of dry-wet cycles have different degrees of degradation of different mechanical parameters of sandstone. As the number of cycles ( n ) increases, the envelope of the M-C rule in the π plane gradually moves to the center of the circle. In this paper, the M-C yield criterion of sandstone in two water-bearing states under different dry-wet cycles is revised. Sandstone is used as the representative rock mass, and the water-rock interaction of the reservoir bank slope rock mass under the condition of reservoir water fluctuation is simulated through experiments. During the process, FLAC 3D was used to carry out a numerical simulation of bank slope stability under the action of water-rock circulation, which provided a useful basis for the stability analysis of reservoir bank slopes.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Arts', 'Building Construction and Design']"

As in many control systems, time delay sets limitation to performance during balancing tasks. Human subjects cannot balance an arbitrarily short stick on the fingertip, because a short stick falls faster than the time needed to make a corrective motion. Also, increased reaction time delay is one of the main reasons of instability during quiet standing, which can lead to falls especially among the elderly. The governing equation of the two models are second-order delay differential equations. In this chapter, stabilizability issues are discussed in terms of the critical delay for different feedback concepts, such as proportional-derivative, proportional-derivative-acceleration and predictor feedback.","['Engineering', 'Solid Mechanics', 'Complexity', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Functional Analysis']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-14009-9_9,en,A Long Journey of Integration,OriginalPaper,"This chapter summarizes the interaction between integration and agency by comparing migrants’ encounters with labour markets through which their agency challenges existing discourses. The chapter investigates the complex relationship between policy discourse, gender, and class in the production of migrant agency across different countries. The gendered experiences of low labour in Denmark centre around the crucial moments of retraining for migrant women, through which they reconsider their adjustment to the labour market as ‘devoid integration’. The EU discourses of integration are further disrupted by humanitarian migrants in Scotland and Switzerland, whose encounters with the non-recognition of qualifications and inadequate social welfare contradict the ‘migrant-welcoming’ national facades. The Canadian grand discourse of ‘smooth transition’ is opposed by the analysis of aspirations that clash with outcomes such as the labour market entrance. In this connection, we can see the Italian ‘borderline’ space of the informal market, within which many legal economic migrants navigate a complex web of existing laws and informal opportunities. The comparison is amplified by a visually ‘successful’ portrait of entrepreneurial integration, which is nevertheless perceived by skilled migrants in Finland as a less desirable option. The quality of migrants’ agency thus becomes contested if they seek to progress in the labour market. An essential element in this contestation is the transnational migrants’ disagreement with official discourses of ethnic solidarity and national citizenship in the Czech Republic. The comparative analysis of these lived experiences leads toward a new understanding of ‘agency’ and ‘resilience’ in labour market integration.","['Social Sciences', 'Migration', 'Labor Economics', 'Sociology of Work']"

We analysed the activities and processes for which central government and its associated organisations use algorithms, classified these into categories, and identified the risks involved in the use of algorithms. In addition, we examined how central government and its associated organisations manage the operation and control the quality of algorithms. Most of the algorithms used by central government are relatively simple. They have a limited effect on private individuals, as it is only such relatively simple algorithms that take automatic decisions. Many of these decisions involve the automation of certain administrative activities, for example the automated sending of letters confirming the receipt of a communication. We did not find any fully self-learning algorithms in central government, only learning algorithms. We urge governments to evaluate algorithms on basis of a predetermined set of criteria and present a framework for such evaluations.","['Business and Management', 'IT in Business', 'Software Management', 'Risk Management', 'Systems and Data Security']"

This is not in itself a new insight, but we lack a good understanding of how and why this was the case. In this chapter I reflect on various ways in which associational life broadened popular participation as well as people’s understandings of politics between 1820 and 1860. Middle-class reformers of all sorts and stripes played an important role in reinventing voluntary associations as tools for political pressure. Using examples from such organisations as the Irish Catholic Association and British anti-slavery societies in the 1820s, and from a Dutch temperance society in the 1840s and 1850s, it will become clear that mass organisation in politics could be very attractive, and was sometimes successful.","['History', 'Social History', 'Political History', 'European History', 'Modern History', 'World History, Global and Transnational History']"

Digital transformation of the TA in Serbia is lagging behind OECD countries and is highly asymmetric. While the Serbian TA is mostly in line with the OECD average regarding infrastructure development, complicated legal procedures and almost annual law amendments results create high level of uncertainty and produce significant costs for taxpayers. Inadequate number of skilled staff is also one of the main reasons for lagging behind in digital transformation process. Finally, some procedures that were supposed to be digitalized are still done in the paper form. The described shortcomings urge the necessity for the paradigm switch from the old paper-based procedures towards a new approach to simultaneously increase budgetary revenues and contribute to the increased efficiency and productivity of businesses and individuals. The changes must include the introduction of automated solutions and automatically derived reports which will decrease taxpayers’ need to directly correspond and/or physically visit the tax administration premises; reallocation and re-qualification of employees and creation of a single data-base to enable accurate and precise tax accounting. Therefore, the most important tax digitalisation challenges in Serbia are also presented and analysed and possible solutions are elaborated and proposed.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business and Management, general', 'Data Engineering']"

The concept of smart city has gradually entered the daily life of community residents. Smart city is a new concept proposed by combining Internet of Things, cloud computing and mobile Internet technologies to achieve a safe, comfortable, convenient and efficient living experience. By investigating the current actual situation of smart city, this paper analyzes some specific requirements and overall development direction of smart city, and makes a detailed analysis of the functional requirements of the system. A smart city management system based on Java programming language and B/S architecture is designed. The design of the back-end management terminal of the system is based on B/S architecture and adopts the MVC framework. The whole system is divided into three basic levels: interface display layer, logical control layer, data access and data model layer. Through the lightweight Web container management work provided by the framework to achieve the management of smart city, greatly improve the management efficiency of managers. This paper conducts a pressure test on the smart city management system, and the test results show that both the system concurrency and the system resource occupation can meet the daily use requirements.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing']"

Traditional methods for determining morphometric characteristics are time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive. However, as remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) technology have advanced, the process has become simpler, less expensive, and faster. The present chapter study prioritizes sub-watersheds based on morphometry using RS and GIS in the Maner watershed, Maharashtra state. The shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) with a resolution of 30 m was utilized to design drainage networks and identify sub-watersheds. The watershed was divided into nine sub-watersheds (SWs) (SW1–SW9), and the sub-watersheds were prioritized depending on morphometric data. Sub-watersheds were prioritized depending on morphometric analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). Several morphometric features such as linear, shape, and relief features were determined for each sub-watershed to prioritize ranking depending on morphometric analysis. Depending on morphometric analysis, four parameters were used in the PCA to rank and prioritize sub-watersheds. The sub-watersheds were divided into low, medium, and high priority depending on morphometric and PCA. SW9 and SW2 were given high priorities depending on morphometric and PCA. For morphometric analysis, high priority has been given to SW2 and SW9, while for PCA, high priority has been given to SW4 and SW7. SW6 is the most common sub-watershed to come under each priority. The high priority indicates that the sub-watershed is most vulnerable to flooding and soil erosion. Statistical research shows that stream order and stream number, as well as stream order and stream length, have a significant association. The results of this chapter may be applicable to many stakeholders involved in managing water and soil conservation and developing watersheds.","['Life Sciences', 'Ecosystems', 'Ecology']"

Drawing on the main strategies proposed within Critical Security Studies in relation to the unmaking of security , in turn, I contend that even if the EWL does not use the security frames that feminist neo-abolitionists inside the EU employ, and in fact explicitly rejects them, it still replicates their problematisation of trafficking in women for sexual exploitation as an epiphenomenon of prostitution, which contains within itself the central element that fosters its securitisation at EU level, namely, the neoliberalism–vulnerability–security nexus .

Current pedagogies for developing innovation skills and innovation of workplace practices are epistemologically misguided. As a result the risk of failure is high, leading to many finding innovation intimidating. This chapter examines the factors which improve enterprise success in innovation and the “unlearning” necessary to avoid reverting to former ways of working. Learning how to deliver better outcomes, when the route to their attainment is uncertain, requires a fundamentally different process from when the link between cause and effect is clear. Traditional knowledge transfer “banking” approaches (Friere, 1969 ) will not work if the answers to “teach” are yet to be found. This “learning paradox” provides the theoretical foundation for a new pedagogy illustrated by successful enterprise innovation initiatives. We argue that innovation is itself a form of learning, which enterprises must master to create successful new products and ways of working. Success achieves outcomes at levels 3 or 4 in Kirkpatrick’s training evaluation model (Kirkpatrick & Kirkpatrick, Evaluating training programs (Vol. Third Edition), 2008), requiring behavior change and improved key performance metrics, respectively. These go far beyond traditional assessments of educational attainment (level 2).

An experimentalist approach had been applied to cope with a situation of high uncertainty, according to which public authorities have been able to learn and readapt their strategy along the way. However, in other instances, when the crisis seemed to wane or at least reduced its intensity, policy decisions were made following a more conventional pattern of polarized consociationalism, whereby different types of political actors—especially political parties and business representatives—were able to reshape and partially co-determine the policy outputs, against the background a policy process that is characteristically open to societal inputs. The second and the fourth stage of the pandemic, corresponding to summer to early winter 2020 and, respectively, late spring to autumn 2021, displayed indeed more politicization, resulting in a reactive rather than anticipatory attitude of policymakers.","['Political Science and International Relations', 'European Politics', 'Governance and Government', 'Comparative Politics']"

Landfill leachate varies according to landfill age, landfill size, type of disposed waste, climate zone, hydrological conditions, waste disposal method, landfill coverage, etc. Filtrate production is always related to a number of factors at the landfill. Thus, for the landfill in the Sarajevo Canton, within the project “Improvement of seven solid waste disposal sites in Bosnia and Herzegovina – Task 3- Smiljevići Landfill Sarajevo”, an analysis of the reduction of filtrate quantities by covering the open areas of the landfill was conducted.

Identity is defined by roles individuals occupy, specific characteristics, and by group membership. Society values identities differently, considering particular identities as the norm and morally neutral or superior. This valuation bestows privilege and power on individuals enjoying certain identities and provides limited opportunities to those with less valued identities.

Consequently, the identification of the laws of behaviour and its damage mechanisms proved to be necessary to master and validate the operating modes of the processes of obtaining the finished stampings. This is established using the standardized Erichsen test, whose responses in Erichsen index and division of constraints coupled with local aspects of damage allow decision-making to be established in order to arrive at a strategy of productivity and quality shaping. The present work deals with these aspects for the case of Fe-Zn coated thin sheets deposited on a grade of Duals-Phases steels (DP600) in order to take them into account via the identification of the models of the damageable behaviour required according to the formulation of the Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman (GTN) law. To do this, experiment plans combined with EF simulation have been adopted according to the concepts of Response Surfaces Methodology (RSM). As a result, taking into account the presence of Fe-Zn coating will optimize the stamping processes on an industrial scale without causing its decohesion during shaping by plastic deformation.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Materials Engineering', 'Classical and Continuum Physics']"

Deeply scaled short-channel transistors are faster but consume more off-state power. This power vs speed trade-off stems from the fundamental physical limit related to the thermionic emission that governs switching in field-effect transistors. There is a broad consensus in the semiconductor industry that future progress is impossible unless the next-generation transistors and circuits overcome the so-called Boltzmann limit associated with thermionic emission over a barrier and offer a steeper on-off switching to enable a more aggressive voltage scaling. In this chapter, we explain the need for and suggest an intuitive classification of the emerging transistor technologies. We use two illustrative examples of next-generation transistors (i.e., negative capacitance FET (NCFET) and phase FET (PhaseFET)) to explain the relative merits of gate-controlled vs channel-controlled steep-slope switching. We explain the basic principle of device operation, summarize the experimental results reported in the literature, and highlight the speed and reliability challenges to be resolved before the devices are integrated into practical systems. In addition, the chapter includes a careful analysis of circuits based on these emerging transistor technologies with applications toward Boolean logic, memories, and non-Boolean computing. The analysis suggests relative merits of various circuit designs and application-specific opportunities for significant power-performance improvement.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Electronic Circuits and Devices', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation']"

Observation involves the sensing of data. Visualisation renders data tractable to the specific sense of vision. There is no visualisation without observation, and some observation requires visualisation for it to happen at all. Visualisation and observation have long been understood as critical underpinnings of theory formation, as well as practice. Over time, a series of debates have prised apart the supposed strict division between looking and theorising, as well as the assumed passivity of looking. These challenges replaced the assertion of independence with claims of causal influence running in both directions. Earlier discussion has focussed on the role of human observers, with the understanding that instrumentation played a mere enabling role, enhancing observation through technology for visualisation and visual enhancement. But new approaches in the philosophy of technology have also questioned this assumption. Postphenomenology, the set of practices leading to contemporary philosophy of technology, encompasses a set of approaches for re-evaluating the role of technology in observation, and with it reassessing the impact of observation on theory formation and clinical practice. With reference to ideas from postphenomenology, we consider the contours of a biophilosophical theory of visual observation.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Anatomy', 'Medical Education', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Visualization', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Computers and Education']"

The calculation of the econometric model shows that the reduction of transaction costs is influenced by the costs of the transport sector and higher professional and transport education, which in the digital economy are closely related to the innovation strategy. The ongoing digital transformation of the economy contributes to the strengthening of this trend, and therefore it is necessary to develop a model that helps optimize transaction costs in the implementation of intellectual entrepreneurship. The problem of optimizing transaction costs during the period of digital transformation, without receiving an adequate solution, hinders the introduction of innovative products. The growth of transaction costs reduces the efficiency and market competitiveness of transport enterprises implementing an innovative product, increases the overall level of costs at all levels, which contributes to an increase in the cost of products or services. In this article, an econometric model describing the impact of the costs of the transport sector and higher professional and transport education on transaction costs is compiled and calculated.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

Numerous investigators have focused on exploring various nonlinear sources, such as nonlinear material definition, different types of crack motion, de-boding, etc. In particular, the nonlinear crack motion continues to be very attractive to investigated due to lack of precise distinction about its impact on the generated higher-order harmonics and/or side harmonics. Furthermore, it was shown in the literature that this type of nonlinearity has the highest impact on the generated nonlinear wave components. Thus, in this paper, the nonlinear shear motion between the crack interfaces is taken into consideration. First, the analytical solution is prepared based on the Coulomb’s friction model, in which the low-frequency modulation of the normal force to cracks interface is assumed. Solution is obtained using the Harmonic Balance method. Next, the results are validated through the experimental investigation, confirming the choice of the model. Lastly, the analysis of the obtained side-bands amplitude components is performed to find characteristic features of the considered crack motion.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

For this purpose, the synthetic measures determined by the TOPIS method and the structures similarity coefficient were used. The statistical data used in the analysis came from the EUROSTAT database and contained information from 2016 to 2020. The conducted analyses confirmed the existence of differences both in the level of use of energy from renewable sources and the structure of its production. The changes in energy balances necessitated by Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and the Council and the goals stipulated in the Paris Agreement also unfolded differently in the countries studied. They resulted in the majority of members achieving the prescribed limits. The highest share of energy from renewable sources was recorded among northern European and Baltic countries. In contrast, it developed the fastest in Central and Eastern Europe. The lowest level of use of green energy was detected among the Balkan countries and in France.","['Energy', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Research Skills', 'Political Science and International Relations, general', 'Sustainable Development']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-030-79827-7_15,en,GaN-Based Lateral and Vertical Devices,OriginalPaper,"In the last decade, GaN has emerged as an excellent material for application in power electronics. The wide energy gap of gallium nitride (3.4 eV) enables high-temperature operation, while the large breakdown field (3.3 MV/cm, 11 times higher than silicon) allows to reach kV-range operation while maintaining a low on-resistance. Thanks to the high mobility of the two-dimensional electron gas at the AlGaN/GaN interface, lateral GaN transistors have a very low on-resistance; commercial products are already on the market, and new technologies are being developed, targeting the 650 V/900 V ranges. Recently, the attention toward vertical GaN transistors has constantly increased: a vertical layout allows to substantially increase current density while taking advantage of the wide bandgap and high breakdown field of GaN. Vertical transistors based on GaN are expected to find application in converters with medium high power levels (>5 to 10 kW), once the technology reaches maturity. This chapter reviews the main properties of GaN-based materials and devices. The first part focuses on the main challenges related to the growth of high-quality GaN epitaxial stacks. The second and the third parts focus on GaN lateral and vertical devices, respectively. Finally, the fourth section describes the trapping and degradation processes that limit the performance and the reliability of GaN transistors, and the related physical mechanisms. This chapter represents an ideal guide for a reader willing to enter the world of GaN devices.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Electronic Circuits and Devices', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation']"

He published more than 300 articles in total. Most of his journalistic work was devoted to political and economic analyses. As a journalist, he has described and commented upon the major economic events and crises of his lifetime, the crisis of 1907/1908, the German Revolution of 1918/1919, the rise and fall of the Weimar Republic and the Great Depression of 1929–1935. During the years of exile, from 1933 until his untimely death in 1941, he has contributed a vast number of newspaper articles, explaining and criticizing the economic and political events in Nazi Germany, depicting and analysing the transformation of the German economy into a war economy, and demonstrating the inherent weaknesses and fragilities of the kind of dictatorial capitalism, as well as pointing out how the Nazi state was pushing ever further into the catastrophe of total war. In his journalistic work, he touched on many topics that he planned to include in a revised and extended version of his masterpiece “Finance Capital”.","['Economics', 'Social Choice/Welfare Economics/Public Choice/Political Economy', 'Political Economy/Economic Systems', 'History of Economic Thought/Methodology', 'European Politics']"

The design of the deflector was developed. Also, a diagram of its location in the vibrating machine reservoir was given. The movement of the abrasive granules and their influence on the deflector was established. The movement of abrasive granules during vibration processing is similar to the movement of atoms or molecules of a gas. The dynamics of the deflector and its effect on the abrasive granules mass were presented. A scheme for forming waves generated by the deflector tab was developed. It is necessary to use deflectors with a large number of tabs to improve the efficiency of vibration treatment. The wave motion in a pseudo-gas of abrasive granules caused by an oscillating deflector was determined. The wave action generated by the deflector on the surface of the processed parts was established. Also, the velocity field in the wave generated by the deflector was given. The pressure of acoustic radiation carried out by a plane wave and the wave action generated by the deflector on the part’s surface were determined.

In this paper, the effect of the insertion length of the overflow tube on classification performance and flow field distribution of the hydrocyclone with a diameter of 50 mm was studied by numerical simulation. It was found that the tangential and axial velocity in the inner swirl increase as the increase of the insertion length of the overflow tube. When the insertion length of the overflow tube increases from 8 to 40 mm, the tangential velocity of the internal swirl increases from 5.13 to 5.50 m/s, an increase of 7.2%; The axial velocity increases from 2.37 to 3.44 m/s, an increase of 45.15%. At the same time, it was found that the classification performance of the hydrocyclone increased first and then decreased with the insertion length increase of the overflow tube, and the best value was obtained when the insertion length was 16 mm. The research showed that choosing the appropriate insertion length of overflow tube was very important to the classification performance of hydrocyclone.

Trust in and understanding of a model greatly increase its deployability. Interpretability and explainability are terms that refer to the understanding of a machine learning model. The relation between these two terms and the requirements for data mining tools are not always clearly defined. This chapter provides a framework for interpretability and provides a taxonomy of interpretability based on the literature. Properties of interpretability are related to the domain and to the methods involved. A distinction is made between inherently interpretable models and post-hoc interpretable models, which in the literature are also referred to as explainable models. This overview will argue that inherently interpretable models are more favorable for deployment than explainable models, which are not as reliable as inherently interpretable models.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It is well known that sensor scheduling is an important mechanism that helps densely deployed wireless sensor networks save energy. On the other hand, geographic forwarding is an efficient scheme for wireless sensor networks as it requires maintaining only local topology information to forward data to their destination. Most of geographic forwarding protocols assume that all sensors are always on (or active) during forwarding. However, such an assumption is unrealistic for real-world applications where sensors are switched on or off (or inactive). This chapter describes our cover-sense-inform framework for connected k - covered wireless sensor networks, where k- coverage, sensor scheduling, and geographic forwarding are jointly considered. Based on our work on connected k- coverage, which is discussed earlier in Chap. 5 , we propose the first design of geographic forwarding protocols for duty-cycled k -covered wireless sensor networks with and without data aggregation. For the case of planar wireless sensor networks, this chapter discusses a few protocols that exploit the geometry of the configurations, which result from our connected k -coverage protocols, and the concept of virtual potential fields. For the case of spatial wireless sensor networks, it discusses our composite geographic forwarding protocol, which uses a combination of deterministic and opportunistic schemes to forward sensed data towards the sink. Moreover, it shows various simulation results of the proposed geographic forwarding protocols and compares them against others.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks']"

However, the evaluation of a healthy or damaged state from the acquired monitoring data is often a data-driven process that can be subjected to a large amount of uncertainty, resulting in false positives and false negatives. Hence, the main idea behind this work focuses on handling the main issues related to the uncertainty management by exploiting the aggregation of different sources of information. In this context, this study is aimed at detecting and locating structural damages in monumental structures with the aid of a data fusion approach including vibration-based system identification, Bayesian-based finite element (FE) model updating and visual inspections. As a preliminary step, potential damage-sensitive sections are defined on the basis of nonlinear static analyses (NLSA) performed on a calibrated FE model and/or engineering judgment (EJ). Then, a surrogate model is established enabling to transfer knowledge from the monitoring data to the updated numerical models and to solve the inverse problem aimed at deriving the posterior statistics of the uncertain parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by using 1-year of recorded data acquired in a monumental structure named Consoli Palace, located in Umbria, central Italy, a region characterized by high seismic hazard. The palace has been continuously monitored by the Authors since 2017 using dynamic, static and environmental sensors.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The extraction of methane from coal beds is an urgent task. The solution of this problem allows degassing of coal beds—a decrease in the volume of methane in them. Also the solution of this problem allows increasing the safety of operation of coal mines by reducing the probability of methane explosions during development. The article reviews the development of a hydro-impulse source that allows creating microcracks in porous bed. In the article a schematic diagram of a hydraulic pulse source is presented. Also the mathematical models of the dynamics of valve opening and the process of filling the implosion chamber with liquid are presented in the article. The results of mathematical modeling are given. The effect of well pressure on the time of the chamber filling and the value of the generated impulse have been determined in the article. The research made it possible to develop the design of the hydro-impulse source and determine its parameters which characterize the impulse impact on the formation. The parameters of the impulse impact are the basis for the technology of impact on the coal bed by the developed source.

It is used primarily to guide the implementation of building information modeling (BIM) and proposes an adaptation of traditional work processes towards more collaborative approaches across the entire lifecycle of built assets. While the use of BIM is increasingly common during design and construction, the use of BIM for facility management (FM) is still an emerging practice. As such, many questions still abound around information management practices during this phase namely with information handover between construction and operations. ISO 19650 provides some insight into this process. This paper discusses a case study of the challenges faced by Quebec construction industry stakeholders in the production and handover of digital information intended for facility management (FM) using ISO 19650 as a framework. The main objective of this research is to understand the potential and impact of ISO 19650 in the Canadian context. Data gathering was done through surveys, and the analysis of project information flows. Results intend to help the construction and facility management industries develop an integrated strategy for BIM implementation within the political, economic, and legal context of Quebec. The results could help stakeholders acknowledge this disruption, identify how it affects their work process and suggest ways to address potential obstacles standing in the way of fluid information management with the framework of ISO 19650.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

But applying this literature to a process as broad and diverse as the SDG negotiations, within an institutional setting as large as the UNGA, is very hard. Thousands of people provided input, in one way or another, to the post-2015 deliberations and each goal area (as well as the many topics that did not become goals) enjoyed lengthy debates both inside of and outside of the formal deliberation chambers, suggesting there is not one objective evidence to policy process which needs to be understood but instead a wide range of processes across different sectors and scales. To help focus this analysis and to provide an inter-sectoral perspective on these processes, Part 3 focuses on three very diverse themes of the debate; health, urban sustainability, and data. I trace the key conceptual issues that were under discussion within each, noting the topics under debate and the supporters and adversaries of each. This kind of detailed thematic analysis is essential to understand the nuances of negotiations and how broad issues are translated into given words, phrases and ideas eventually featured in outcome documents. It also helps identify what, if any, where the key entry points for scientists and academics to provide their evidence.

We aimed to evaluate patterns of hospital and regional adherence to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for gastric cancer. Methods Using the National Cancer Database (2004–2015), we identified patients with stage I–III gastric cancer. Hospital-level guideline adherence was calculated by dividing the patients who received guideline adherent care by the total patients treated at that hospital. OS was estimated for each hospital. Associations between adherence, region, and survival were compared using mixed-effects, hierarchical regression. Results Among 576 hospitals, the median hospital guideline adherence rate was 25% (range 0–76%) and varied significantly by region ( p  = 0.001). Adherence was highest in the Middle Atlantic (29%) and lowest in the East South Central region (19%); hospitals in the New England, Middle Atlantic, and East North Central regions were more likely to be guideline adherent than those in the East South Central region (all p  < 0.05), after adjusting for patient and hospital mix. Most (35%) of the adherence variation was attributable to the hospital. Median 2-year OS varied significantly by region. After adjusting for hospital and patient mix, hazard of mortality was 17% lower in the Middle Atlantic (hazard ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.74–0.90) relative to the East South Central region, with most of the variation (54%) attributable to patient-level factors. Conclusions Hospital-level guideline adherence for gastric cancer demonstrated significant regional variation and was associated with longer OS, suggesting that efforts to improve guideline adherence should be directed toward lower-performing hospitals.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery']"

That this concept may be converted to a mathematical-probabilistic measure supposedly offers security and control over contingencies and random events. Probabilistic risk is part of the current societal obsession with quantification for grasping realities and making forecasts. The disproportionate use of the notion of risk places many different phenomena under the same conceptual umbrella, subjecting them to the reductionist criteria of rule by calculation.

This chapter criticises riscophrenia, that is to say, the inflated use of the notion of risk and the fallacy that chance can be eliminated, knowing that such efforts are inglorious, neglect the prudential principle, and may produce new unpredictabilities and uncertainties. Risk analyses are unable to question the fundamental reasoning embedded in the instrumental vision which permeates modernity.

Over time, less study has been done on modeling migration flows than has been done on modeling other types of flows, such as commutes. One of the biggest hurdles to empirical analysis and theoretical developments in the modeling of migration flows has been a lack of data. Because a migration trip is far less frequent than a commute, it necessitates a longitudinal set of data for study. The data from a large mobile phone network is used in this chapter to infer migration trips and their distribution. Intra/inter-district migration flows, migration distance distribution, and origin-destination (O-D) movements are among the interesting properties of the inferred migration trips. The log-linear model, classic gravity model, and recently developed radiation model are investigated for migration trip distribution modeling, with distinct approaches applied in setting parameters for each model. As a result, among the different models, gravity and log-linear models with a direct distance (displacement) as a trip cost and district centroids as reference points perform the best. Among the radiation models, a model that considers district population is the best performing model, but not as good as the gravity and log-linear models.

Methods The data of 563 HCC patients with MVI after hepatectomy from two hospitals were retrospectively reviewed. Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyse early recurrence. The risk classification for early recurrence was established by using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis and validated by using two independent validation cohorts from two hospitals. Results Multivariate analysis revealed that four indices, namely, infection of chronic viral hepatitis, MVI classification, tumour size, and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), were independent prognostic factors for early recurrence in HCC patients with MVI. By CART analysis, MVI classification and serum AFP became the nodes of a decision tree and 3-stratification classifications that satisfactorily determined the risk of early recurrence were established. The area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of the classification for early recurrence at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 years were 0.75, 0.73, and 0.71, respectively, which were all significantly higher than three common classic HCC stages (BCLC stage, Chinese stage, and TNM stage). The calibration curves showed good agreement between predictions by classification for early recurrence and actual survival outcomes. These prediction results also were confirmed in the independent internal and external validation cohorts. Conclusions The 3 stratification classifications enabled satisfactory risk evaluation of early recurrence in HCC patients with MVI after hepatectomy.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery']"

In the present study, FE models were developed for laboratory-scale deep drawing experiments of tailor-welded blanks (TWBs) made of two different dual-phase sheets of steel, namely DP600 and DP980. In FE models, associated flow rule (AFR) and non-associated flow rule (NAFR) approaches were coupled with the anisotropic Hill48 quadratic yield equation. The deep drawing experiments of the TWBs were conducted successfully, and the experimental data such as thinning development, cup edge profile, and weld line movement were compared to validate the FE predicted results. It was found that FE simulation implementing the NAFR approach predicted deep drawing behavior more accurately compared to that of the AFR approach. Moreover, the non-uniform material flow of the deep-drawn TWB cup was predicted the first time implementing the NAFR-based FE simulation, and the results of the present work demonstrated the improved capability in the prediction of anisotropy of sheet metal. Therefore, it is worthy to implement the NAFR-based approach in FE simulation as far as the accuracy of the predicted results is concerned during forming of anisotropic sheet metal.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Robotics and Automation']"

The purpose of the independent audit is to provide confidence in the quality of financial reports. In addition, accrual accounting provides for a better sense of a company’s overall financial health than the cash basis accounting method. Therefore, the rational conceptualization between audit quality, accrual earning management, and financial performance is essential and must be examined especially in the companies listed in the stock market. The proposed model of this research has external audit and audit committee effeteness as predictors for both accrual earning management, and firms’ financial performance. In addition, accrual earning management is mediating the relationships between audit quality and financial performance. Further work is important to empirically examine the model to validate the proposed relationships and make a comparison between the different markets.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-19748-2_2,en,Beyond a Buzzword: Situated Participation Through Socially Oriented Urban Living Labs,OriginalPaper,"In the broader framework of Living Labs and participatory planning, the essay proposes socially-oriented Urban Living Labs (ULLs) as a possible way of understanding and experimenting with participation in marginalized contexts. It does so by applying a focus on individual/collective capacities and enabling processes to support them. Drawing on the literature and the observation and implementation of concrete cases, the essay proposes a reflection on ULLs as situated environments in which “everyone’s” capacities are formed and tested, thus challenging the functioning of local democracy. This implies a focus as much on residents and local agents as on institutions. The essay proposes a shift from Living Labs to socially oriented Urban Living Labs, in order to foster the social dimension of planning, questioning the mechanisms of involvement and support of the most fragile profiles, often excluded from the political process. The perspective is the implementation of an enabling and mutual learning process through devices to reinforce organizations and people’s ability to reflect on, aspire to, and take action for the transformation of their life context, becoming real agents of change.","['Social Sciences', 'Human Geography', 'Public Policy', 'Geography, general']"
