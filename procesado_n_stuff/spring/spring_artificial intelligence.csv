However, traditional sequential convex optimization algorithms suffer from shortcomings in terms of their poor real-time performance. This work focuses on applying the deep learning-based closed-loop guidance algorithm and error propagation analysis for powered landing, thereby significantly improving the real-time performance. First, a controller consisting of two deep neural networks is constructed to map the thrust direction and magnitude of the rocket according to the state variables. Thereafter, the analytical transition relationships between different uncertainty sources and the state propagation error in a single guidance period are analyzed by adopting linear covariance analysis. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed methods is verified via a comparison with the indirect method and Monte Carlo simulations. Compared with the traditional sequential convex optimization algorithm, our method reduces the computation time from 75 ms to less than 1 ms. Therefore, it shows potential for online applications.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

Herein, an angles-only navigation algorithm with multisensor data fusion is proposed to derive the relative motion states between two noncooperative spacecraft. First, the design model of the proposed algorithm is introduced, including the derivation of the state propagation and measurement equations. Subsequently, models for the sensor and actuator are introduced, and the effects of various factors on the sensors and actuators are considered. The square-root unscented Kalman filter is used to design the angles-only navigation filtering scheme. Additionally, the Clohessy—Wiltshire terminal guidance algorithm is introduced to obtain the theoretical relative motion trajectories during the rendezvous operations of two noncooperative spacecraft. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed angles-only navigation algorithm is verified using a semi-physical simulation platform. The results prove that an optical navigation camera combined with average accelerometers and occasional orbital maneuvers is feasible for spacecraft noncooperative rendezvous using angles-only navigation.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

In this work, we study a novel and efficient full-duplex strategy network ( FSNet ) to address this issue, by considering a better mutual restraint scheme linking motion and appearance allowing exploitation of cross-modal features from the fusion and decoding stage. Specifically, we introduce a relational cross-attention module (RCAM) to achieve bidirectional message propagation across embedding sub-spaces. To improve the model’s robustness and update inconsistent features from the spatiotemporal embeddings, we adopt a bidirectional purification module after the RCAM. Extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks show that our FSNet is robust to various challenging scenarios (e.g., motion blur and occlusion), and compares well to leading methods both for video object segmentation and video salient object detection.

However, it is quite challenging as human facial images contain large areas of similar textures, rich expressions, and large rotations. These characteristics also result in the scarcity of large, annotated real-world datasets. We propose a robust and accurate method to learn facial optical flow in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, we utilize various shape priors, including face depth, landmarks, and parsing, to guide the self-supervised learning task via a differentiable nonrigid registration framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable improvements for facial optical flow estimation in the presence of significant expressions and large rotations.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

In this paper, we present an efficient end-to-end deep learning model for automatically detecting and removing specular highlights in a single image. In particular, an encoder—decoder network is utilized to detect specular highlights, and then a novel Unet-Transformer network performs highlight removal; we append transformer modules instead of feature maps in the Unet architecture. We also introduce a highlight detection module as a mask to guide the removal task. Thus, these two networks can be jointly trained in an effective manner. Thanks to the hierarchical and global properties of the transformer mechanism, our framework is able to establish relationships between continuous self-attention layers, making it possible to directly model the mapping between the diffuse area and the specular highlight area, and reduce indeterminacy within areas containing strong specular highlight reflection. Experiments on public benchmark and real-world images demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both highlight detection and removal tasks.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

Our key observation is that to recover the underlying structures as well as surface details, given partial input, a fundamental component is a good feature representation that can capture both global structure and local geometric details. We accordingly first propose FSNet, a feature structuring module that can adaptively aggregate point-wise features into a 2D structured feature map by learning multiple latent patterns from local regions. We then integrate FSNet into a coarse-to-fine pipeline for point cloud completion. Specifically, a 2D convolutional neural network is adopted to decode feature maps from FSNet into a coarse and complete point cloud. Next, a point cloud upsampling network is used to generate a dense point cloud from the partial input and the coarse intermediate output. To efficiently exploit local structures and enhance point distribution uniformity, we propose IFNet, a point upsampling module with a self-correction mechanism that can progressively refine details of the generated dense point cloud. We have conducted qualitative and quantitative experiments on ShapeNet, MVP, and KITTI datasets, which demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art point cloud completion approaches.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

Capturing human motion accurately from a monocular image sequence remains challenging; modeling quality is strongly influenced by temporal consistency of the captured body motion. Our work presents an elegant solution to integrating temporal constraints during fitting. This increases both temporal consistency and robustness during optimization. In detail, we derive parameters of a sequence of body models, representing shape and motion of a person. We optimize these parameters over the complete image sequence, fitting a single consistent body shape while imposing temporal consistency on the body motion, assuming body joint trajectories to be linear over short time. Our approach enables the derivation of realistic 3D body models from image sequences, including jaw pose, facial expression, and articulated hands. Our experiments show that our approach accurately estimates body shape and motion, even for challenging movements and poses. Further, we apply it to the particular application of sign language analysis, where accurate and temporally consistent motion modelling is essential, and show that the approach is well-suited to this kind of application.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

While voxel-based deep learning frameworks have been proposed for this segmentation task, their performance remains limited. In this study, we offer a two-step surface-based deep learning pipeline that achieves significantly better results. Our proposed model takes a surface model of an entire set of principal brain arteries containing aneurysms as input and returns aneurysm surfaces as output. A user first generates a surface model by manually specifying multiple thresholds for time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography images. The system then samples small surface fragments from the entire set of brain arteries and classifies the surface fragments according to whether aneurysms are present using a point-based deep learning network (PointNet++). Finally, the system applies surface segmentation (SO-Net) to surface fragments containing aneurysms. We conduct a direct comparison of the segmentation performance of our proposed surface-based framework and an existing voxel-based method by counting voxels: our framework achieves a much higher Dice similarity (72%) than the prior approach (46%).","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

As a popular application, composition recommendation for a photo focusing on a specific subject has been ignored by recent deep-learning-based composition recommendation approaches. In this paper, we propose a subject-aware image composition recommendation method, SAC-Net, which takes an RGB image and a binary subject window mask as input, and returns good compositions as crops containing the subject. Our model first determines candidate scores for all possible coarse cropping windows. The crops with high candidate scores are selected and further refined by regressing their corner points to generate the output recommended cropping windows. The final scores of the refined crops are predicted by a final score regression module. Unlike existing methods that need to preset several cropping windows, our network is able to automatically regress cropping windows with arbitrary aspect ratios and sizes. We propose novel stability losses for maximizing smoothness when changing cropping windows along with view changes. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods not only on the subject-aware image composition recommendation task, but also for general purpose composition recommendation. We also have designed a multistage labeling scheme so that a large amount of ranked pairs can be produced economically. We use this scheme to propose the first subject-aware composition dataset SACD, which contains 2777 images, and more than 5 million composition ranked pairs.

In contrast to significant recent advances in automating the FRP manufacturing process via 3D printing, quality inspection and defect detection remain largely manual and inefficient. In this paper, we propose a new approach to automatically detect, from microscope images, one of the major defects in 3D printed FRP parts: fiber-deficient areas (or equivalently, resin-rich areas). From cross-sectional microscope images, we detect the locations and sizes of fibers, construct their Voronoi diagram, and employ α -shape theory to determine fiber-deficient areas. Our Voronoi diagram and α -shape construction algorithms are specialized to exploit typical characteristics of 3D printed FRP parts, giving significant efficiency gains. Our algorithms robustly handle real-world inputs containing hundreds of thousands of fiber cross-sections, whether in general or non-general position.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

Most target search studies, especially in robotics, focus on determining either the shortest path when the target’s position is known, or a strategy to find the target as quickly as possible when the target’s position is unknown. However, the target’s position is often known intermittently in the real world, e.g., in the case of using surveillance cameras. Our goal is to help user find a dynamic target efficiently in the real world when the target’s position is intermittently known. In order to achieve this purpose, we have designed an AR guidance assistance system to provide optimal current directional guidance to users, based on searching a prediction graph. We assume that a certain number of depth cameras are fixed in a real scene to obtain dynamic target’s position. The system automatically analyzes all possible meetings between the user and the target, and generates optimal directional guidance to help the user catch up with the target. A user study was used to evaluate our method, and its results showed that compared to free search and a top-view method, our method significantly improves target search efficiency.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

In this study, an integrated visual navigation system was proposed based on angles-only measurements to robustly and accurately determine the pose of the lander during the final landing phase. The system used the lander’s global pose information provided by an orbiter, which was deployed in space in advance, and its relative motion information in adjacent images to jointly estimate its optimal state. First, the landmarks on the asteroid surface and markers on the lander were identified from the images acquired by the orbiter. Subsequently, an angles-only measurement model concerning the landmarks and markers was constructed to estimate the orbiter’s position and lander’s pose. Subsequently, a method based on the epipolar constraint was proposed to estimate the lander’s inter-frame motion. Then, the absolute pose and relative motion of the lander were fused using an extended Kalman filter. Additionally, the observability criterion and covariance of the state error were provided. Finally, synthetic image sequences were generated to validate the proposed navigation system, and numerical results demonstrated its advance in terms of robustness and accuracy.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

Based on the visual navigation framework and motion characteristics of asteroids, a robust and efficient template feature matching method is proposed to adapt to feature distortion and scale change cases for visual navigation of asteroids. The proposed method is primarily based on a motion-constrained discriminative correlation filter (DCF). The prior information provided by the motion constraints between sequence images is used to provide a predicted search region for template feature matching. Additionally, some specific template feature samples are generated using the motion constraints for correlation filter learning, which is beneficial for training a scale and feature distortion adaptive correlation filter for accurate feature matching. Moreover, average peak-to-correlation energy (APCE) and jointly consistent measurements (JCMs) were used to eliminate false matching. Images captured by the Touch And Go Camera System (TAGCAMS) of the Bennu asteroid were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

First, based on a rotating mass dipole model, the gravitational field of asteroids is characterized using a few parameters. To solve all the parameters of this simplified model, a stepped parameter estimation model is constructed based on different gravity field models. Second, to overcome linearization difficulties caused by the coupling of the parameters to be estimated and the system state, a dynamic parameter linearization technique is proposed such that all terms except the parameter terms are known or available. Moreover, the Lyapunov function of the HNNs is matched to the problem of minimizing parameter estimation errors. Equilibrium values of the Lyapunov function are used as estimated values. The proposed method is applied to natural elongated asteroids 216 Kleopatra, 951 Gaspra, and 433 Eros. Simulation results indicate that this method can estimate the simplified model parameters rapidly, and that the estimated simplified model provides a good approximation of the gravity field of elongated asteroids.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

Based on the advanced CNN method high-resolution net (HRNet) and multi-temporal HR-RSIs, a framework is proposed for monitoring a green evolution of courtyard buildings characterized by their courtyards being roofed (CBR). The proposed framework consists of an expert module focusing on scenes analysis, a CV module for automatic detection, an evaluation module containing thresholds, and an output module for data analysis. Based on this, the changes in the adoption of different CBR technologies (CBRTs), including light-translucent CBRTs (LT-CBRTs) and non-light-translucent CBRTs (NLT-CBRTs), in 24 villages in southern Hebei were identified from 2007 to 2021. The evolution of CBRTs was featured as an inverse S-curve, and differences were found in their evolution stage, adoption ratio, and development speed for different villages. LT-CBRTs are the dominant type but are being replaced and surpassed by NLT-CBRTs in some villages, characterizing different preferences for the technology type of villages. The proposed research framework provides a reference for the evolution monitoring of vernacular buildings, and the identified evolution laws enable to trace and predict the adoption of different CBRTs in a particular village. This work lays a foundation for future exploration of the occurrence and development mechanism of the CBR phenomenon and provides an important reference for the optimization and promotion of CBRTs.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"

Physics-informed machine learning could address this need by adding physical consistency to such models. This paper presents metamodeling of thermal comfort in non-air-conditioned buildings using physics-informed machine learning. The studied metamodel incorporated knowledge of both quasi-steady-state heat transfer and dynamic simulation results. Adaptive thermal comfort in an office located in cold and hot European climates was studied with the number of overheating hours as index. A one-at-a-time method was used to gain knowledge from dynamic simulation with TRNSYS software. This knowledge was used to filter the training data and to choose probability distributions for metamodel forms alternative to polynomial. The response of the dynamic model was positively skewed; and thus, the symmetric logistic and hyperbolic secant distributions were inappropriate and outperformed by positively skewed distributions. Incorporating physical knowledge into the metamodel was much more effective than doubling the size of the training sample. The highly flexible Kumaraswamy distribution provided the best performance with R 2 equal to 0.9994 for the cold climate and 0.9975 for the hot climate. Physics-informed machine learning could combine the strength of both physics and machine learning models, and could therefore support building design with flexible, accurate and interpretable metamodels.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis']"

The dispersibility and tribological properties of IL—BT as oil-based additives for 500SN depend on the increase in interlamellar space in BT and improve as the chain length is increased. More importantly, the IL—BT nanomaterial outperforms individual BT in improving wear resistance, owing to its sheet layers were deformed and sprawled in furrows along the metal surface, thereby resulting in low surface adhesion.

Multi-objective optimization could be an effective tool for tackling the aforementioned challenges. Therefore, this paper proposes a life-cycle optimization framework considering thermal comfort, which is beneficial to promoting residents’ motivation for low-carbon retrofit in arid climate regions. First, in response to the above problems, three objective functions are specified in the framework, which are global warming potential (GWP), life cycle cost (LCC), and thermal discomfort hours (TDH). To improve the optimization efficiency, this research uses Deep Neural Networks (DNN) combined with NSGA-II to construct a high-precision prediction model (meta-model for optimization) based on the energy consumption simulation database formed by the orthogonal multi-dimensional design parameters. The accuracy index of the modified model is R 2 > 0.99, cv(RMSE) ≤ 1%, and NMBE ≤ 0.2%, which gets rid of the dilemma of low prediction accuracy of traditional machine learning models. In the scheme comparison and selection stage, the TOPSIS based on two empowerment methods is applied to meet different design tendencies, where the entropy-based method can avoid the interference of subjective preference and significantly improve the objectivity and scientific nature of decision analysis. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is conducted on the variables, which supports guidance for practitioners to carry out the low-carbon design. Finally, the multi-objective optimization analysis for a farmhouse in Turpan is taken as a case study to evaluate the performance of the framework.

A wide range of fields, including motorsport, health care, manufacturing, the armed forces, and agriculture all make use of them on a day-to-day basis. Increasing efficiency through automation is the goal of Industry 4.0. The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief overview and viewpoint on the most recent advancements in AI and the associated problems. Attempts to define the main ideas and tools behind this new era of manufacturing in the early years of the so-called fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) always ended up referring to the concept of smart machines that could communicate with each other and with the environment.

This is due to multiple factors, training of health professionals aimed at curing diseases, lack of quality data, processing capacity, poor multidisciplinary approach, etc. However, this paradigm is changing, focusing on maintaining the health of individuals to avoid diseases, improving social welfare. To achieve this, the new approach proposes that medicine must be Preventive, Participatory, Predictive, and Personalized (P4 Medicine). In this chapter, we will analyze how artificial intelligence can convincingly contribute to the construction of P4 Medicine, through the processing of key data such as DNA, electronic medical records and environmental variables to which people have been exposed. Here we can find complex data such as Computed Tomography images, electroencephalograms, free text in electronic medical records, pharmacological data, etc. These data have grown exponentially and efforts to improve their quality are already paying off. However, it is no longer possible for a health professional to analyze them to provide a better diagnosis or carry out preventive work on diseases, requiring the formation of multidisciplinary teams to find new solutions to ancient problems, such as healthcare, where data processing, knowledge extraction and its subsequent parameterization in support systems for medical decision-making are vital to save lives. In this sense, artificial intelligence, together with new methods for processing complex data and computational resources to process massive data, will be key to improving the humanity health.","['Computer Science', 'Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

But the development of this kind of technology model that mimics humans involves a lot of complex calculations and complex algorithms that are difficult to explain and understand. For this problem, the concept of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is developed and introduced. It is the technology that is developed to ease the understanding process of machine learning solutions for humans. It is the concept that is being developed for making it convenient for humans to understand and interpret machine language. Black model machine learning (ML) algorithms are very hard to understand for humans who have not developed them. AI models that involve the methods like genetic algorithms or deep learning concepts are very difficult to understand. It sometimes becomes a very hard task for the domain experts too to understand the ML algorithms of the black block models, so the need for the development of this type of technology was felt. Many times, results are developed with very high accuracy are quite easy to understand for the domain experts. But Explainable artificial intelligence has a great potential to make a change in domains like finance, medicines, etc. It plays a vital role where it is important to understand the results to build trustworthy algorithms. XAI can play a great role in “third-wave AI systems” which include machines that can interact directly with the environment and that can build explanatory models that allow them to develop the characteristics of real-world phenomena. XAI has the potential to play a great role where the organizations need to build trustworthy AI models and to make them trustworthy the explainability of the AI models should be there for others as well. This technology is developed primarily to make AI understandable to those who are practitioners. This book chapter presents a wide and insightful view of XAI and its application in various fields.

In addition, many of the cases do not differ radically from ethics cases related to other novel technologies, even though the use of AI Artificial intelligence can exacerbate existing concerns. Ethical issues can rarely be resolved to everybody’s full satisfaction, not least because they often involve the balancing of competing goods. What is essential is space for human reflection and decision-making within the use of AI. Questions about what we can and should do, why we should act in particular ways and how we evaluate the ethical quality of our actions and their outcomes are part of what it means to be human.

The central question is whether an AI should be allowed to own its own copyright. Related to the question of copyright is one of regulation. Currently, there is a vigorous debate on both regulation of algorithms, as well as regulation by algorithms, since the latter may yield more objective outcomes. Critics point, however, to the dehumanizing effects of such regulation, and to the fact that such algorithms may not be objective to begin with, since they have been trained on (potentially biased) human-generated data.

Edge Computing based on the same premise, stores, processes, and manages data directly at Internet of Things (IoT) endpoints. Edge artificial intelligence uses the device's hardware to process data and performs machine learning and deep learning procedures. In the model, you can troubleshoot and improve model performance while also assisting others in understanding the behavior of your models. To make the area more real, explainable edge devices come in a wide range of costs and capabilities. A decade ago, we couldn’t imagine that explainable edge artificial intelligence would be at today’s level. Now it is a part of industries and even devices for customer service. The best example of explainable edge AI is virtual assistants such as Alexa, google assistant. They learn from the user’s world and phrases and can store them directly on the device. These are just a few examples later, and we have possible applications in future works on the explainable edge artificial intelligence. Edge Computing Platform facilitates the development and elastic operation of apps and services. Its benefits the AI assisting in overcoming the technical obstacles that AI-enabled apps experience. Combination of edge and AI is buzzwords within the industry to deliver the performance and reduce the cost compared to state of arts XAI applications. Moreover edge artificial intelligence are reducing the latency, improving user experience, and reducing the necessary bandwidth, consequently reducing the costs of internet services. It surfs this movement since the need for data processing on the device themselves also represents the increasing use of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence edge processing focused on model which trained them in central data center using historical datasets. Compression techniques of data that enables squeezing large artificial intelligence models into small hardware form factors could push some training to the edge over time.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Substantial questions are still open about the algorithmic legality of AI choices. Deep neural networks do not allow full eXplainability of the decision-making process as the programmer himself does not have the ability to be aware of the logical steps taken to achieve the proposed goal. In these cases the question arises of the “AI black box” which collides with the rules of Italian administrative law which, on the contrary, seeks total transparency as a great metaphor for a “glass house” public administration and is oriented towards a shared administration with citizens. The objective of the paper is to explore the torsion points of algorithmic decision making towards the rules of the administrative procedure, bringing the algorithmic procedure back to a transparency in line with the European Commission's choice of an anthropocentric and transparent artificial intelligence by design that aims the improvement of the algorithm's eXplainability techniques (XAI). If refining XAI will be the key to a complete application of AI in the PA, this path, in order not to slow down the spread of AI and thus increase the gap to the detriment of the public sector, will have to be preceded by a logic of experimentation and incremental input: from the widespread automation of routine activities and administrative procedures with no margin of discretion to a gradual experimentation of AI solutions in complex use cases to support public decision-making through parallel analysis and verification processes. This approach can only be guaranteed through a joint work of jurists and computer scientists in the design of transparent algorithms by design, in the dogmatic construction of an Algorithmic Decision Making to respond to the principle of enhanced transparency required to guarantee the legitimacy of A.I. in administrative activity.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The availability of enormous datasets, as well as recent advancements in deep learning methods, are allowing AI systems to perform at or even beyond the level of human performance on an expanding variety of challenging tasks. However, because of their layered non-linear structure, these strong models have traditionally been regarded as “black boxes,” since they provide no information about how they arrive at their predictions and hence cannot be used trustily to generate predictions. They are often opaque, but they are capable of making accurate predictions that cannot be explained in any other way. All of these choices are having an increasing amount of effect on the lives of individuals. The distrust of totally non-human, autonomous artificial intelligence systems is established as the cornerstone of the movement. The root of distrust lies in a lack of knowledge as to why intelligent systems make certain decisions in certain situations. As a result, this problem has sparked a fresh discussion over explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Several lines of research work have since picked up on the definition, understanding, and implementation of explainability, including expert systems, machine learning, recommender systems, and approaches to neural-symbolic learning and reasoning, all of which have occurred primarily during different periods in the history of artificial intelligence. This chapter serves as an introduction for academics and practitioners who are interested in learning about essential parts of the new and quickly increasing field of research on XAI. The first section, titled “Introduction,” provides an overall summary of the Explainable Artificial Intelligence. Section  2 describes the need of trust and transparency in AI, which is what led to the development of the idea of XAI. Section  3 discusses the many approaches that contribute to the functioning of XAI. The principal applications domain of Explainable Artificial Intelligence is the topic of discussion in Sect.  4 . In Sect.  5 , the upcoming difficulties and potential directions that this developing technology may take are discussed.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

However, this approach has been criticized for reflecting only a snapshot of the organization’s assets and threats. Furthermore, identifying threats and the ability to remain updated on current threats and vulnerabilities are often dependent on skilled and experienced experts, causing risks to be primarily determined based on subjective judgment [46]. Nevertheless, this also poses a challenge to organizations that cannot stay up-to-date with what assets are vulnerable or attain personnel with the necessary experience and know-how to obtain relevant information on cybersecurity threats towards those assets [8, 30, 37].","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Privacy', 'Cryptology', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

The software can be operated on different kinds of hardware systems or platforms but does not require to have any physical shape. Section 2.2 gives an overview of different AI technology aspects. It shows the differences in data computation and progress between humans and computer systems. Section 2.3 describes several AI technologies and highlights the challenge of generated bias. If the AI algorithm gets trained with an already biased data set whether that can happen with consciousness or not, it will not generate a “better human.” The next Sect. 2.4 lists some AI challenges. A current main challenge is that humans still see AI systems as robots or machines and think of physical threats or opportunities. As AI systems can be only software modules, it is recommended to shift the broad society discussions from an attacking Terminator robot to broader ethics and responsibility discussion. Every citizen should take responsibility and proactive actions to shape “Friendly AI” systems. Like every technology, also AI can get abused and used in a not general friendly way. Section 2.5 describes opportunities and risks of AI technology. As humans stopped being goal driven, Section 2.6 highlights the scenario, where future AI systems might overtake the definition of goals for humans. To generate a broad awareness within society to develop and implement AI systems in daily life, it needs acceptance, transparency, and understanding.

Therefore, research on intelligent or artificial intelligence-based real-time predictive maintenance of automated processing facilities, which occupies a large proportion in the general production system, is quite significant. In this study, for the intelligent maintenance or intelligent predictive maintenance of such processing equipment, first, the “Conv2d-LSTM” technique, which reduces the parameters of the LSTM network layer and adds a Conv2d layer, is applied to the real-time spindle load data to verify the state judgment of the machining tool. Second, the real-time diagnostic performance for machining quality (status analysis for each tool) was verified by applying the spectrogram image using “STFT” to the “Pretrained Network model” for the machining load data. As a result of the study, it was verified that the learning time was shortened, and the performance was excellent (loss value lowered) compared to the application of “Bi-LSTM” in the state judgment through the prediction of the machining tool load. It was possible to confirm the quality judgment through classification.

In some cases, however, the amount of data is still not sufficiently large (e.g. in some machine learning applications). Data augmentation is a widely used mechanism to increase the available data in such cases. Current augmentation methods are mostly developed for statistical data and only a small part of these methods is directly applicable to graphs. In a recent research project, a novel encoding of pairwise graph matchings is introduced. The basic idea of this encoding, termed matching-graph, is to formalize the stable cores of pairs of patterns by means of graphs. In the present paper, we propose to use these matching-graphs to augment training sets of graphs in order to stabilize the training process of state-of-the-art graph neural networks. In an experimental evaluation on five graph data sets, we show that this novel augmentation technique is able to significantly improve the classification accuracy of three different neural network models.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computers and Education', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.

The bacterial pathogens develop AMR by two types of mechanisms, one is intrinsic resistance due to the mutations in chromosomal genes and another is extrinsic resistance by the acquisition of external plasmid-mediated genes. The key to diagnose AMR lies in the DNA sequence of bacteria harboring the resistance-conferring mechanisms. The advancements in technology have generated a plethora of genomics data that can be utilized for the identification of diagnostic markers. Moreover, machine learning (ML) has created novel opportunities to significantly solve healthcare problems using bioinformatics techniques.

However, how to efficiently apply brain dynamics for the recognition of brain states is still unclear and need more investigations. The spiking neural network (SNN) is a promising model with better performance in the pattern recognition of event streams. Thus, this paper proposes an algorithm framework for brain states recognition by fusing brain dynamics and SNN, where the brain dynamics are estimated as the dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) matrices. Through applying the DFC-SNN algorithm to the dataset of resting state electroencephalograph signals from healthy subjects and obsessive compulsive disorder patients, we observed that this algorithm was competent to perform the recognition of pathological brain states. It showed that the convergence of SNN model was rapid within less than 20 epochs, and the accuracy was 87.5% under optimal threshold of DFC matrices. In summary, this is the first attempting for the recognition of brain states via the aspect of brain dynamics.

One of the major systems influencing the safety of AVs is its navigation system. Road localisation of autonomous vehicles is reliant on consistent accurate Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning information. The GNSS relies on a number of satellites to perform triangulation and may experience signal loss around tall buildings, bridges, tunnels, trees, etc. We previously proposed the Wheel Odometry Neural Network (WhONet) as an approach to provide continuous positioning information in the absence of the GNSS signals. We achieved this by integrating the GNSS output with the wheel encoders’ measurements from the vehicle whilst also learning the uncertainties present in the position estimation. However, the positioning problem is a safety critical one and thus requires a qualitative assessment of the reasons for the predictions of the WhONet model at any point of use. There is therefore the need to provide explanations for the WhONet’s predictions to justify its reliability and thus provide a higher level of transparency and accountability to relevant stakeholders. Explainability in this work is achieved through the use of Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to examine the decision-making process of the WhONet model on an Inertial and Odometry Vehicle Navigation Benchmark Data subset describing an approximate straight-line trajectory. Our study shows that on an approximate straight-line motion, the two rear wheels are responsible for the most increase in the position uncertainty estimation error compared to the two front wheels.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

But the strange thing is that the motives not only do not converge but may contradict each other. This indicates that there are fundamental errors in the very construction of different XAI concepts. These errors create not only contradictions between different visions of XAI, but also common to many concepts of error. The main one is the absence or incorrect answer to the question “For whom exactly should AI be explained?”. Turning to human psychology and social processes that are accompanied by the exchange of explanations, we will try to consider what benefits the explanation brings to people and groups. Correcting fundamental errors in the construction of XAI concepts, we show that neural networks are no less explanatory AI than linear models and decision trees. Moreover, we will show what the neural network approach can do so that the explanation will not need to be exchanged for the quality of AI algorithms, and that they can even improve them.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It should include an element that makes this scheme symmetrical - the collective conscious (the term is formed by analogy with the term collective unconscious). This approach allows us to distinguish between the concepts of intellect, mind and consciousness. In particular, the intellect is interpreted as a structural component of the personality, most closely adjacent to the collective conscious. It is shown that it is this structural component of personality that can be converted into a digital format already at this stage of research by using methods for decoding algorithms for the operation of convolutional and similar neural networks, which we previously proposed based on new methods of digital signal processing based on the use of non-binary Galois fields.

Functional MRI (fMRI) need rapid acquisition to follow dynamic processes. Radial directions, due to their quality of overfitting the k-space center, are particularly suitable to average the effects of movements and are hence often used in fMRI. The acquisition of a complete dataset could be too slow to follow dynamic processes and undersampling is required to improve temporal resolution. Undersampling is accomplished randomly, basing on Compressed Sensing (CS) constraints to reduce aliasing and structured artifacts after reconstruction. However, reconstruction could be improved and/or data can be further reduced if a-priori information is collected regarding the underlying image under reconstruction and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based strategies are used to drive the process. As an example of the effective synergy between AI and data-driven acquisition/reconstruction in radial MRI, we present a GReedy Adaptive Data-driven Environment (GRADE) for intelligent radial sampling that uses the power spectrum of the reconstructed image and AI-based superresolution strategies in an iterative acquisition/reconstruction process. A detailed description of the method is furnished and experimental results are reported. Results demonstrate that GRADE reduces data redundancy and converges first to high quality images with respect to other undersampling radial modalities, such as regular sampling and golden angle (GA).","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Health Informatics']"

This humungous amount of data is nowadays available in nearly every field, be it science or social domain. As much of these collected data are time-sensitive, they need to be utilized timely to give an effective outcome. Data fusion is of paramount significance in enhancing the collected data's effectiveness. But, today, as AI has gained significant momentum, machine learning (ML) techniques, mainly deep neural network (DNN), are widely utilized to deliver what is expected from the data. Edge intelligence tries to fulfil the promise of giving efficient and timely output. Deep learning, undoubtedly being robust, also possesses some disadvantages, and one of these relates to the explainability of ML methods that help solve any problem. With dense layers in DNN and millions of parameters, it is difficult to interpret the model creating a black box. The chapter aims to outline the explainability of data fusion at the edge. It highlights different data models of fusion, discusses a framework for AI and data fusion at the edge and identifies potential challenges and possible solutions in this regard. While doing so, the chapter intends to cover the fundamentals of explainability in AI, the need to convert the black box system into a transparent one, and the associated opportunities for explainable artificial intelligence.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It sums up that all past societies had ethical standards with the central goal to survive. Ethics itself goes back a long time in history. Already Aristotle was speaking about ethics, and it will be an even more central topic for the future of humanity. Will AGI consider the needs and understandings of the lower-developed humans? How will humans handle “intelligence explosion” and recursive scenarios, where AI or AGI will replicate itself constantly? Humans reshaped the planet earth to gain benefits, will this be done by an AI system as well? This chapter lists an overview of different AI ethics frameworks and lists different viewpoints for the situation that AI systems will have their own moral status. Section 3.1 describes approaches to how to train AI systems in ethics. One major challenge is, if AI systems will get trained with already biased data sets. Overall, it is still unclear how to teach ethics to AI systems. Section 3.2 lists criteria for Product Development of AI systems and describes the importance of testing environments. Next, Sect. 3.3 analyses some ethical and moral challenges. It shows that moral decision-making is not about logic and rationality, instead, it is about psychologically acceptable explanations. Therefore, it requires a deep understanding of humans and their behavior. Other challenges are accountability (who is responsible for a failure?), law adaption, quick reproduction of AI systems, and the not predictable social impact. Section 3.4 dives deeper into existing guidelines. A survey shows the importance of the requirement of transparency and safety for users and consumers. It describes the outcome of the summary of an overview of 47 values and principles that are based on several manifestos. The AIHLEG of the European Commission defines Trustworthy AI by seven key requirements and offers an AI assessment list.","['Business and Management', 'IT in Business', 'Business Ethics', 'Engineering Ethics', 'Organization', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The cybernetics of the “black box” is based on a logical approach. The rapid development of modern medicine is due to the use of technical diagnostic tools, and the use of new information technologies. Technical means of diagnosing allow you to visualize the processes of diagnosing. Intelligent information technologies use the methods and tools of artificial intelligence and can speed up the diagnosis and improve its accuracy. The authors of the work have been working on biomedical images for many years, building CAD systems with elements of artificial intelligence. Biomedical (cytological, histological, and immunohistochemical) images are used for diagnosis in oncology. The problems of classification, generation, segmentation, and clustering of biomedical images are solved in the work. For these purposes, the following means of computational intelligence were used: CNN, GAN, and U-net. CNN is used in the paper to classify images. Several models for the classification of biomedical images are proposed and a comparative analysis with existing analogs is given. The accuracy of classification for cytological images was 86%, for histological was 84%. The authors analyzed the architectures of convolutional neural networks of the U-net type for automatic segmentation of immunohistochemical images. A modified neural network architecture for the segmentation of immunohistochemical images has been developed. Computer experiments were performed on different numbers of stages and iterations.

While significant portions of human learning still take place in traditional classrooms, researchers and educators have innovated several learning experiences that are embodied, project-based, inquiry-driven, collaborative, and open-ended. Furthermore, there has been greater acknowledgement of the varying timescales and contexts where meaningful learning takes place, as well as greater attention to previously underappreciated competencies like creativity, self-regulation, and collaboration. This expansion in the types, contexts, and timescales of human learning necessitate novel analytic approaches. This chapter will discuss how artificial intelligence-based tools and technologies can help researchers and practitioners navigate and enact these novel approaches to learning, while also providing a meaningful lens for student reflection and inquiry. Consequently, this chapter includes discussions of (1) technologies that provide learners with a broader set of modalities to showcase their knowledge, (2) tools that offer insights within groups of students using audio/video information, and (3) analytic techniques and interfaces for helping researchers collect and analyze different types of multimodal data across contexts.

The debate is currently focused on the possibility of using algorithmic decisions also in the administration of justice: the use of algorithms which are capable of making choices should help overcome the propensity for eventual human-decision errors, in favour of the theoretically more certain efficiency of algorithmic decisions. The creation of a predictive justice system, however, raises doubts, especially in consideration of certain factors that might alter the algorithmic logic, e.g. the quality of data and the possibility of system error, which could lead to situations of indirect discrimination. With reference to the concerns and risks of the use of AI for justice purposes, in December 2018, the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice adopted the “Ethical Charter on the use of AI in judicial systems and in related areas” that identifies 5 fundamental principles capable of guaranteeing efficient implementation: 1. respect for fundamental rights, 2. non-discrimination, 3. quality and security, 4. transparency—fairness-impartiality in data processing, 5. possibility of control by the user—‘under user control’. The proposed paper, after a brief survey of the critical aspects of the use of AI systems and an analysis of the contents of the EU Ethical Charter, will focus on the possibility of using AI for forecasting and non-decisional purposes, highlighting how the forecasting method can optimize use, especially in civil law systems.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The proposed solution is based on static analysis of raw opcode sequences from disassembled programs and other complementary features such as API calls and permissions, with features indicative of malware automatically learned by the network. This removes the need for hand-engineered malware features while performing classification. Using the Drebin and AMD benchmark datasets, the benefits of this multi-view architecture to combine multiple feature sources are demonstrated in our findings. We conclude the use of deep learning architectures enables state-of-art results in automatic malware detection, while reducing the dependency on feature engineering and domain expertise. Using multi-view compared to single-view architectures improves performance through exposure to simultaneous sources of information, learning a more effective set of features. The model achieves state-of-the art detection performance in a challenging zero-day scenario, reducing false positives by 77% in relative terms on average, an important metric for potential real-world deployment.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Privacy', 'Cryptology', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

Accurate diagnosis can provide effective treatment for patients. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework namely SE-1DCNN-LSTM to automatically learn the latent EEG features of the two subtypes. Firstly, a SE block was used as a channel attention module to adaptively learn the weight of each electrode. Subsequently, a 1DCNN-LSTM network was applied to learn discriminative and effective patterns of EEG for MDD and BD. The noteworthy performance of proposed method was verified in 44 MDD and 26 BD patients with 81.10% and 83.16% classification accuracy in epoch-level and subject-level respectively. An extensive investigation of ablation analysis and window size of EEG epoch were conducted. Through visual analysis of electrode weights, we found that the weights of Fp1, Fp2, O1 and O2 electrodes were slightly greater. It demonstrated that the prefrontal lobe and occipital lobe may be possibly important brain regions for MDD and BD recognition. Overall, this study shows the effectiveness of the proposed model in EEG-based automatic diagnosis for MDD and BD.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Applications', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Mathematics of Computing']"

The model is constructed and recorded using statistical analysis using the number of inhabitants as an input. Given the fact that our model demonstrated cost-effective prediction accuracy, we highly advocate it as a platform for researchers who want to use real-world smart building test beds and analyze machine learning as a promising place for energy demand prediction and scheduling.

In this chapter attention will be focused on those particular kinds of abductive cognition that generate deep results, able to go beyond data thanks to a rich explanatory strength, in which asking “why” is the key-factor. Hypothetical cognition beyond data will be also described thanks to the illustration of model-based aspects of abduction, in which the activity of grasping the world, beyond what mere rough data suggests, takes advantage of models, diagrams, and simulations of various nature. Moreover, I will delineate the concept of manipulative abduction, first introduced in my book of Abduction, Reason, and Science , by showing how we can find methods of manipulative constructivity, in which cognitive processes are centered on the exploitation of external representations to the aim of reaching deep and very abstract results, able to powerfully transcend data, at the same time to create cognitive values “in” and “out” of data. In two separated sections I will illustrate (1) how the excessive emphasis on the merits of the computational programs which learn from data renders human abductive “creative” cognition increasingly assaulted and jeopardized, and (2) the challenges against human abduction and epistemic rigor on the part of what I call computational invasive “subcultures” based on rough computational explanations. Finally, thanks to the analysis of the computational system called AlphaGo , I will stress the attention to what I call locked and unlocked strategies that shed further light on the cognitive aspects of both humans and deep learning machines. The character and the role of these cognitive strategies is strictly related to the generation of cognitive outputs, which range from weak (closer to data) to strong level (beyond data) of knowledge creativity. Locked abductive strategies, even if cognitively weak, characterize (sometimes amazing) kinds of hypothetical creative reasoning and are typical of intelligent machines based on a massive exploitation of data, but they are limited in eco-cognitive openness , which instead qualifies human cognizers who are performing higher kinds of abductive creative reasoning, where cognitive strategies are instead unlocked and are able to transcend data.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The growing concern about food safety in recent decades has increased the need for food quality monitoring worldwide. Nowadays, advances in artificial intelligence may substantially aid researchers and enterprises in boosting food processing efficiency. This paper concerns the coffee sector as one of the valuable commodities in the global economy. The coffee sector is subject to high levels of production volatility, caused not only by price concerns but also by a range of other uncontrollable factors, including inadequate crop management, weather events, and coffee pests and illnesses. One of the diseases that affect Coffee leaves is a miner disease. It has an impact on its production and quality. This study attempts to use different deep learning architecture approaches to spot this illness in coffee leaves and develop an expert system to help coffee farmers diagnose problems early on.

As a result, predicting illness at an early stage is crucial. Doctors, on the other hand, struggle to make accurate diagnoses based solely on symptoms. The most challenging task is predicting sickness properly. Machine learning plays a key part in forecasting in order to complete this difficult task. To tackle this challenge, machine learning plays a key role in illness prediction. Medical research creates a vast amount of data every year. Early patient care has benefitted from effective medical data analysis because of the rising quantity of data growth in the medical and healthcare professions. In data mining, disease data is utilised to identify hidden patterns in huge volumes of medical data. Based on the patient's symptoms, we created a broad disease prediction. Machine learning algorithms like ANFIS and CNN are used to properly predict sickness (adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system). The collection of illness symptoms is necessary for disease prediction. For an accurate prognosis, this general illness prediction takes into account the person's lifestyle and medical history. When it comes to illness prediction, ANFIS outperforms CNN by a wide margin (96.7%). ANFIS, on the other hand, does not require as much time or memory to train and test because it does not use the UCI repository dataset. There are several libraries and header files included with the Anaconda (Jupyter) notebook that make Python programming more precise and accurate.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security']"

Rice is one of the most important grains of food. It feeds nearly half of the world’s population and supports a large number of jobs. Crop diseases cause significant yield losses around the world, particularly in Sub Saharan Africa. To implement effective disease management measures, pathogen detection and understanding spatiotemporal dynamics are critical, and this necessitates the use of molecular detection methods, particularly to discriminate between infections that cause similar symptoms. As a result, adequate disease mitigation for rice plants is critical. We used to our proposes a model for detecting three rice leaf diseases: brown spot, leaf smut, and bacterial leaf blight. This paper presents a unique model for the classification of rice leaf diseases by multi-class SVM, K—means clustering, and PSO. The disease was classified using an SVM classifier and the classifier accuracy is optimized using PSO.

The success of deep learning stems from relaxing the need for the non-trivial task of feature-engineering. However, this remarkable success is conditioned on manually annotating a large amount of data points to generate suitable training datasets to supervise training of these networks. Since manual data annotation is time-consuming and expensive in many applications, learning in data-scarce regimes has been a major recent area of research focus in machine learning (ML) and AI. Transferring and reusing knowledge from a related learning problem is a core strategy for addressing challenges of learning in data-scarce regimens. Transfer learning is not a new field in ML and several great survey exist on this topic [ 63 , 95 , 98 , 105 , 120 ]. However, these existing survey are meant to be general and extensively survey many works in the area. In this chapter, we survey a very specific subset of works in this area.

It is known that due to numerous uncertainties of infrastructural and technological interaction of cargo carriers, such as bad weather conditions, technical and technological problems, as well as temporary ones (for example, adjusting the plan for the wagons and ships supply), it is difficult to ensure adaptive and flexible strategic planning and management in the port transport system. Under the current conditions, the further development of port transport and technological systems is advisable not only due to the strengthening of the transport infrastructure, but also due to the introducing and improving information and logistics systems in limiting areas, advanced methods of managing the transportation process, improving technologies, increasing efficiency of interaction between transport participants and intellectualizing transport and logistics chains (TLC) management. The use of hybrid neuro-fuzzy modeling of transport and logistics processes, which integrates the natural intelligence of a specialist-expert and the intelligence of a machine (artificial intelligence based on the use of neural networks), is substantiated. The main logical and linguistic “statements” of economic agents (EA) interaction are described. An iterative mechanism for the interaction of economic entities of transport and logistics chains has been developed based on the adapted Ashby’s homeostat principle. The developed procedure for managing transport and logistics chains and their links ensures automatic adaptation of the transport process to the specified performance indicators, the capabilities of TLC links and external influences.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

So far, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in nursing education has been limited. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one solution for ensuring quality decision-making in demanding clinical situations in two ways. First, AI applications can support healthcare professionals’ clinical decisions. Second, AI techniques can be used to support learning clinical reasoning (CR) in healthcare education and training. This chapter focuses on the potential of exploiting AI through game metrics in nursing education. Previously, simulation games have proven effective for learning clinical reasoning skills. However, game metrics have not been commonly utilized in nursing simulation games, although research in other disciplines has shown that game metrics are suitable for demonstrating the achievement of learning outcomes. This chapter discusses the possibilities of using game metrics to develop adaptive features for nursing simulation games. Personalization and adaptivity in simulation games can enable meaningful learning experiences and enable nursing students to achieve good CR skills for their future work in constantly challenging clinical situations.","['Psychology', 'Psychology, general', 'Computer Applications', 'Education, general', 'Philosophy of Mind', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

A traditional freight transportation system that moves the commodities between nodes of the supply chain takes a lot of time and cost. It accounts for large quantities of carbon dioxide emissions from fuel consumption. The physical internet aims to facilitate the flow of moving goods through modular units and sharing the resources to reduce time, effort, and cost. Also it helps to change the way of moving goods across participants of the supply chain and make the way physical goods are moved, handled, stored, and supplied across the world more economical, environment-friendly, socially-efficient and sustainable. As the participants of the supply chain will have access to share central hubs and transportation means, this will help them to move the commodities from one place to another more efficiently. This research takes Egypt as a case study to investigate the main transportation problems and how to apply physical internet to solve it. This paper aims to propose a framework to apply the physical internet with its tools and data science techniques to overcome transportation problems, as it will help to reduce transportation costs, reduce the harmful impact on the environment and enhance the transportation system to be more efficient, through building a pool of sharable resources and standardizing the goods to enhance collaboration between the participants of the supply chain. In addition to the use of neural networks that benefit the supply chain in many areas, it will support in decision making, forecasting, and choosing the optimal path for transportation.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

A Hybrid Model of Convolutional Networks with a Weighted Average Evolutionary Algorithm,OriginalPaper,"In recent years the field of computer vision has been one of the most advanced in computer science. This is due to the impact of the new techniques in artificial intelligence being deep learning models as the biggest milestone in this field. Computer vision has many applications, but medical diagnosis is one of the most beneficial. Not only in terms of public health, but also in economic benefits. Many medical tests are images, from well-known X-rays to other less used such as thermographies that are cheaper and less invasive. In this paper, we present a hybrid model combining deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks with a weighted average algorithm. The model is trained with thermography images, and we will benefit from segmenting them into the red, green, and blue channels. Then, the weighted average algorithm will calculate the final diagnosis by combining the three previous models. The aim is not only to obtain an accurate model for breast cancer diagnosis but to know what the influence of the different color channels is. Results show that although by separating colors the red channel obtains better accuracy, when using a weighted average algorithm increases by giving more weight to the green color. In this case, accuracy goes near to 97%.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Emerging digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) are increasingly implemented at the organisational, or most commonly the project, level. Notwithstanding, some industry leaders have failed to shape an environment of opportunity to disrupt; often used as a tool to pursue productivity, doing more of the same. We argue that there is an opportunity to disrupt the industry’s construct, rather than to replicate ancient habits at a faster pace. However, such a pursuit creates a complex paradigm. Leaders demand innovation that makes sense to humans, i.e., to themselves, creating an epistemological barrier that limits the aspirational goal of disruption. This is better classified as Sustaining Innovation (SI) as opposed to Disruptive Innovation (DI), as it does not displace the original ideals and fundamentals of the sector’s construct. A possible avenue to disrupt the current industry knowledge construct is to engage in a different level of consciousness, by generating insights through AI techniques at a size and speed impossible thus far. We present a case study in the field of Project Management and show results of disruptive insights in a portfolio of approximately US$ 20B, exploring the orthodoxies of such breakaway. We further discuss the leadership traits which could motivate DI in AEC, arguing that this requires an open engagement in an exploratory journey with limited certainty ex-ante , driven by awareness and vision.

Traditional cryptography is ineffective in a communication environment with limited space or time. A deep reinforcement learning algorithm is used to improve the performance of each subsystem as well as the overall mix of cars and trucks. Some argue that the blockchain is a public database that no one owns. A distributed data storage system with point-to-point transmissions and consensus mechanisms. Blockchain blocks store time stamps and digital signs in addition to using encryption algorithms, smart contracts, and other computer tools. Data is stored in multiple locations, making it easier to share data. The data records’ digital signatures can also verify the data. Because hash points connect the blocks, hackers cannot alter the data. People don’t have to trust a central authority or anyone else to agree on what’s going on with the ledger. Using the blockchain, people can share data securely, dependable, and traceable manner. There are several ways to improve transportation using blockchain technology.

To better understand the factors that foster or hinder people’s interaction with a particular technology, acceptance models such as TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) or the UTAUT (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) are commonly used. However, in the case of humanoid social and service robotics these models may have some drawbacks, as the acceptance towards such robots not only depends on their functions and capabilities but on their shape and movement capability. For that reason, if acceptance models are intended to be used for robot evaluation, it is necessary to adequately design and pilot them in order to have well tested evaluation tools prior to hands-on technology assessment. With that aim, this work presents a pilot study which has been carried out with a group of elderly students at the university of the third age - Programa de la Experiencia of the Universidad Pontificia de Salamanca. The goal is to select the most suitable tools found in the literature to assess the acceptance of a companion robot for the elderly, which is currently under development, and to test the suitability of these tools before conducting experiments with the real robotic platform.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This novel virus leads to pneumonia, which is an infection that inflames the lungs’ air sacs of a human. One of the methods to detect those inflames is by using x-rays for the chest. In this paper, a pneumonia chest x-ray detection based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) with a fine-tuned deep transfer learning for a limited dataset will be presented. The use of GAN positively affects the proposed model robustness and made it immune to the overfitting problem and helps in generating more images from the dataset. The dataset used in this research consists of 5863 X-ray images with two categories: Normal and Pneumonia. This research uses only 10% of the dataset for training data and generates 90% of images using GAN to prove the efficiency of the proposed model. Through the paper, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, Squeeznet, and Resnet18 are selected as deep transfer learning models to detect the pneumonia from chest x-rays. Those models are selected based on their small number of layers on their architectures, which will reflect in reducing the complexity of the models and the consumed memory and time. Using a combination of GAN and deep transfer models proved it is efficiency according to testing accuracy measurement. The research concludes that the Resnet18 is the most appropriate deep transfer model according to testing accuracy measurement and achieved 99% with the other performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score while using GAN as an image augmenter. Finally, a comparison result was carried out at the end of the research with related work which used the same dataset except that this research used only 10% of original dataset.

Currently, there are three major methods for using CNN: starting from scratch, using a pre-trained network off the shelf, and performing unsupervised pre-training with supervised changes. When it comes to those with dietary restrictions, automatic food detection and assessment are critical. In this research, we show how to address detection difficulties by combining three CNNs. The different CNN architectures are then assessed. The amount of parameters in the examined CNN models ranges from 5,000 to 160 million, depending on the number of layers. Second, the various CNNs under consideration are assessed based on dataset sizes and physical image context. The results are assessed in terms of performance vs. training time vs. accuracy. Finally, the accuracy of CNNs is investigated and examined using human knowledge and classification from the human visual system (HVS). Finally, additional categorization techniques, such as bag-of-words, are considered to solve this problem. Based on the findings, it can be concluded that the HVS is more accurate when a data set comprises a wide range of variables.

Different types of tags have been used, such as those related to the musical genre, others related to the emotions evoked by the song, and others related to the user's context of action or activity. These tags are usually provided by users in social networks and are often present in popular songs in the catalog. However, new songs added to the catalog or those belonging to the long tail do not have these tags and the need arises to create auto-taggers capable of tagging these songs. Several works and datasets have been proposed in the literature to solve this problem. In this paper we propose to infer activity context tags from simple song features obtained from the Spotify streaming service. A comparison of different multi-label classification models is presented and discussed. The results show how Spotify API features can be employed as simple features to use together with multi-label classification models to infer context labels for tracks.

There are many applications in detecting and predicting users’ stances in many fields like politics, digital marketing and social science. Most research works in this area are using the users’ textual contents like tweets or posts as indicators for their stances in a given topic. Recently, some works started to consider users’ online activities like networks of accounts that users interact with in mentions, replies or retweets as indicators of their stances. There are challenges in using users’ online activities to detect or predict their stances in given topics. One of these challenges is that most of users’ interactions might not be relevant to the given topics. Moreover, the large number of users’ interactions might have a significant impact in detecting their stances efficiently. The main objective of this paper is to overcome these challenges by considering the most relevant users’ online interactions to improve the stances prediction and detection tasks. To meet this objective, we selected only the most relevant interactions to given topics using a filtration method based on the users’ interaction frequency.

However, the brain WM developmental trajectory of Chinese children remains to be less fully investigated and possibly follows different trends compared with Western children, since there have been behavior or cognitive evidence suggesting the intercultural developmental differences between them. In this study, we utilized the cross-sectional diffusion tensor imaging technique to measure the age-related WM changes and hemispheric asymmetry in 71 right-handed Chinese children ranging in age from 6 to 10 years. DTI indices of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), as well as axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) were assessed in 12 major white matter tracts in both two hemispheres respectively. We found the developmental age correlated positively with FA value and negatively with MD value in most WM regions observed. Besides, hemispheric asymmetry was identified in most of WM tracts. By contrast, the age-related WM changes and hemispheric asymmetry found in Chinese children population may be more widespread than in Western children population reported by previous studies. Overall, the present study characterized the influence of age and hemispheric asymmetry on WM of Chinese children’s brain during development.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Applications', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Mathematics of Computing']"

When a teacher is preparing a programming course, she/he must take into account the previous knowledge of the students who are going to take the course. Given that some students can learn more easily than others, it is interesting to make available to the people in the second group means and materials that facilitate the acquisition of knowledge. This work is related to the teaching-learning process of the fundamentals of programming in a university Degree whose students have very varied previous knowledge. This makes learning the basic concepts of programming difficult for some of the students, who must dedicate their time to two global tasks: developing the ability to propose solutions to computer problems and learning to use a programming language to be able to represent said solutions. Students who have more difficulty tackling both tasks should focus on the first, since the second task is useless if the student does not know how to propose solutions to the problems.

In this chapter, a novel GA-based method to automatically design CNN architectures named AE-CNN will be introduced with the following highlights. Firstly, the use of AE-CNN has no pre-conditions on any prior knowledge of basic CNN design, examined datasets, GA, pre-processing, re-composition, and post-processing. Secondly, the variable-length encoding technique is used to estimate the best CNN depth. The new operators for crossover and mutation are invented and included in for exploring and exploiting the search space in discovering the ideal CNN architectures in order to achieve variable-length encoding. Thirdly, for accelerating the architecture design, an efficient encoding approach according to RBs and DBs are designed, and limited computational resources are used, while AE-CNN achieves promising results. It is worth noting that, while the RBs and DBs are employed in AE-CNN, users are no need to be familiar with these blocks in order to use it.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Mixed reality head-mounted displays (MRHMDs) have the potential of improving the practical applications for BCIs. However, it’s unclear whether the visual stimulus color designed for traditional BCIs still works in mixed reality. Therefore, this study developed a 10-command SSVEP-BCI system in mixed reality using Hololens2, and explored the system’s performance with two stimulus colors (white and red) against four monochrome backgrounds (green, blue, white, and black). Eight subjects participated in the experiment. Cross-correlation task-related component analysis (xTRCA) was used to recognize the target command. Results showed that both stimulus and background colors affect BCI performance. Specifically, the white stimulus color significantly outperformed the red one on the blue and black backgrounds, while the red stimulus outperformed the white one on the green and white backgrounds. The color contrast ratio (CCR) between the background and stimulus colors correlated positively with SSVEP recognition accuracy. In mixed reality, SSVEP-based BCIs must optimize visual stimulus color, and the CCR is an important criterion for optimization.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Applications', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Mathematics of Computing']"

The combination of AI and IoT (Artificial intelligence of things—AIoT) has already showed many useful applications and opportunities in many industries and other fields, like ecology, disaster management, and the society. Over the past decade, the idea has gained attention that not only computer hardware consumes resources (raw materials and energy) over its life cycle, but software also significantly contributes to the footprint of these systems, since it triggers their production, usage, and eventual disposal and renewal. To counter this consumption, it is necessary to have appropriate tools to assess it first. Therefore, in this paper, we extend upon existing methods for the measurement, assessment, and eventual optimization of software, regarding their resource- and energy efficiency and apply them to the field of AIoT-based systems.","['Business and Management', 'IT in Business', 'Environmental Management', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In recent years, the development the computing as well as the storage capacity has increased drastically. These breakthroughs in the technology have blessed us with various data storage technologies and computational engines. Because of the breakthrough in recent years, we are generating humongous amounts of data of which 80% of data is unstructured data and only 20% of data is structured. Unstructured data are mainly composed of images, video and as well as the natural language, i.e. text. These 80% unstructured data consist of the enormous information, but it is difficult to unravel the information contained in these data. Convolution neural network (CNN) is backbone of computer vision and deals with extracting information from the image and video, before the invention of recurrent neural network (RNN), CNN was also employed for natural language processing (NLP) task such as classification and text generation, but the specialty of CNN lies where the dataset consists of sound signals, images or sequence of frames. On Internet, we can find 60% of the unstructured dataset consists of images or sequence of image or text. Basically, image consists of the features which is the orientation of the pixels in a well-defined pattern which can be extracted by using kernel’s known as the feature maps and Maxpooling layers to extract the underlying feature present in the image to train the neural network. CNN is one of the parts of supervised learning techniques which uses labelled data, but it is difficult to label huge number of images. The similarity-based learning enables us to control the similarity percentage as well as it has minimum labelling procedure, i.e. labelling of the dataset is to be labelled 0 or 1. Similarity learning is used to compute the percentage of the features which are similar in the target image with respect to the input image. Image consists of three channels, i.e. red, green and blue channels, which is basically a 2D vector with pixel values in range of 0–255. These individual channels contribute to the features present in the images, and if we can calculate the similarity between input image and the query image, then we can be able to present the unstructured images in relation to the similarity with respect to the input image by using the channels in channel-based CNN tower.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Information Storage and Retrieval']"

Arlington [ 1 ]). Many studies prove the effectiveness and positive impact of using smart telephones, mobile apps, and computer games to practice skills as therapy for children with ASD (Meghan et al. in Pediatrics 141:335–345 [ 2 ]). This review summarizes some of the most interesting and accessible serious games described in the scientific literature and designed to improve the social and communication skills of infants and toddlers with ASD. Learning and playing games are fundamental to the development of children's social skills allowing them to form independent relationships with peers (Simonoff et al. in J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry 47(8):921–929 [ 3 ]). As autistic children often have difficulty with peer relationships (Gordon-Lipkin et al. in Pediatrics 141(4) [ 4 ]), developing game-based skills through computer-assisted solutions could be an essential tool for autistic children to improve their social performance.

In the loss function used for training, we used Simpson coefficient to measure the overlapping of graphs. The degree of inclusion was measured as cosine similarity of the obtained vectors. To evaluate the method, we used card images of competitive Karuta. The adjacency of letters on the card was represented as a graph, and lack of recognized letters under the realistic environment such as under sunlight or shadow gives a subgraph of the graph for the card.

In 2013, deep neural networks were vulnerable to perturbed samples during the testing/deployment stage. Deep learning becomes a significant issue when we apply such algorithms in designing safety–critical applications. Deep neural networks are fooled by adding some noise intentionally in the image such that the changes are sometimes not noticeable to the human eye and are known as an adversarial mechanism. The noise adds in such a direction that the difference between the original and perturbed images should be minimal. This work demonstrates the designing of adversarial images and analyzing them on the disease prediction using a chest X-ray prototype system. This work illustrates the design of adversarial samples using three different methods: an image augmentation scheme, filtering, and patches and analysis of how adversarial samples affect the result in real-world clinical settings. The change in the clinical setting not only affects the healthcare economy but also raises technical vulnerability. This work attempts to design and improve a more robust medical learning system.

Although the source domains are related to the target domain, the difference of data distribution between source and target domains may lead to negative transfer. Therefore, selecting the high-quality source data is conducive to mitigate the problem. However, the existing methods select the data with uniform criteria, neglecting the variety of multiple source domains. In this paper, we propose a reinforced learning Data Selector with the Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC) algorithm for MDA. Specifically, the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm has two Q-value Critic networks, it can better judge the performance of the data. Select the data in multi-source domains to migrate with our target domain, and use the difference in loss both before and after the model to determine the quality of the data and whether it is retained.

Therefore, this article evaluates the current state of utilising deep learning in the construction management tasks to enable researchers to determine the capabilities of current solutions and find research gaps to carry out more research to bridge revealed knowledge and practice gaps. First, the scientometric analysis is conducted for 181 articles to assess the density of publications on different topics of deep learning-based construction management applications. After that, a thematic and gap analysis is conducted to analyse the contributions and limitations of key published articles in each area of application. The scientometric analysis indicates four main applications of deep learning in construction management: automating progress monitoring, automating safety warning for workers, managing construction equipment, and integrating IoT with deep learning to collect data from the site automatically. The thematic and gap analysis refers to many successful cases of deep learning in automating site management tasks. However, more validations are recommended to test developed solutions, as well as additional research is required to consider practitioners’ and workers’ perspectives to implement mentioned applications in their daily tasks.

The tremendous development of networked devices had increased its reach over the primitive network topologies. This significant change has launched the revolution after flat-page. The surge in the global urban population is placing new demands on people's daily lives in terms of pollution, public safety, road congestion, etc. To accommodate this rapid growth, new technologies are being developed and smarter cities are being built. Incorporating the Internet of Things (IoT) into everyday life makes it possible to develop new smart solutions such as services and applications for industries like hospitals, surveillance, forestry, etc. Research on Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning (DL), and help of Data Visualization have shown how IoT performance can be improved with some technological aids. This creates a rapid demand for addition and works in terms of Big Data with first-class technologies that we have around us, so in this paper, we will talk about such things and show a comparison on this basis with the other works that are under it, with the deep learning and artificial intelligence models. This study will help us to show how it overall contributes to the growth of the Internet of Things in society to provide a better life for future generations. Finally, we will outline the existing obstacles and problems that occur during the smart city growth facilities.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security']"

The situation has become particularly difficult now after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even now, however, it is common for people to consult their doctor too late, after the disease has developed. To protect patients from severe disease, it is recommended that any symptoms disturbing the respiratory system be detected as early as possible. This article presents an early prototype of a device that can be compared to a digital stethoscope that performs auto-breath analysis. So apart from recording the respiratory cycles, the device also analyzes them. In addition, it also has the functionality of notifying the user (e.g. via a smartphone) about the need to go to the doctor for a more detailed examination. The audio recording of breath cycles is transformed to a two-dimensional matrix using mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC). Such a matrix is analyzed by an artificial neural network. As a result of the research, it was found that the best of the obtained solutions of the presented neural network achieved the desired accuracy and precision at the level of 84%.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Computational Intelligence']"

A Use Case,OriginalPaper,"The aim of this work is the development of an information system that, by integrating data from different sources and applying semantic technologies, makes it possible to publish and share with society information about the scientific production generated in the university environment. This promotes the dissemination of research results, as well as, from a more ethical point of view, contributing to the transparency of the institution and to the knowledge society. The objective is achieved by implementing a CRIS (Current Research Information System) in a university environment. The main purpose of a CRIS system is to give visibility to the university’s research work, making public the information about its scientific production (publications, projects, theses, …), and those who produce it, the researchers and their research groups. The CRIS system proposal presented is innovative and disruptive due to its advanced features, which means that its performance goes beyond that of a traditional CRIS. Specifically, CRIS represents a case study or application on the one hand of semantic technologies, which allows querying through a SPARQL endpoint, as well as reusing shared data by exporting them in different formats. On the other hand, CRIS also contributes to the development of an institutional data repository by allowing data from different sources to be integrated into a single system.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The two most prevalent types of skin cancer include melanoma and non-melanoma. Melanoma has been identified as the utmost dangerous skin cancer. Yet, discriminating melanoma lesions from non-melanoma lesions has proven challenging. Several artificial intelligence-based strategies have been introduced in the literature to handle skin cancer detection, including deep learning and few-shot learning strategies. According to the evidence in the literature, deep learning algorithms are reported to perform well when trained on large datasets. However, they are only effective when the target domain has enough labeled samples; they do not ensure adequate network activation variables to adjust to new target regions rapidly when the target domain has insufficient data. Consequently, few-shot learning paradigms have been presented in the literature to promote learning from such limited amounts of labeled data. A search on PubMed from inception to 7 June 2022 for studies investigating the review of the application of deep learning and few-shot learning in the detection of skin cancer was performed via the use of title terms “Deep Learning” AND “Few-Shot Learning” AND “Skin Cancer Detection” AND “Review,” combined with title terms or MeSH terms “Deep Learning” AND “Few-Shot Learning” AND “Skin Cancer Detection” AND “Review,” with no limits on language or date of publication. We found no paper that has reviewed the application of deep learning and few-shot learning in detecting skin cancer. This paper, therefore, presents a brief overview of some of the most critical applications of deep learning and few-shot learning schemes in the detection of skin cancer lesions from skin image data.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

One of the possible solutions to this problem is the use of companion robots to improve the life quality of these people. Currently, there are multiple solutions in the state of the art that allow to deal with this problem but the price of these robots is prohibitive. To solve this gap, it is necessary that research and development solutions focus on the development of cheaper robots. In this work, a new open source architecture is proposed to enable the development of low-cost companion robots. The proposed architecture consists of four layers: physical, reactive, deliberative and control. To reduce costs it is necessary to reduce the number of hardware devices and include more open source processing. For each layer we propose a series of basic open source modules needed to implement the common activities of a company robot. A minimum set of hardware devices is proposed for a low-cost robot.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The importance of XAI problems in the framework of automatic analysis of hypotheses concerning the interpretation of the learning situation is noted. In order to combine the structural and functional approaches within a single logic of analysis, various graphic notations are considered. Vertical (for different scopes of learning situation coverage) and horizontal (for different aspects of analysis) transitions between decision-making levels are shown for the proposed decision-making model. A combination of the method of Cognitive Maps of Knowledge Diagnosis (CMKD, structural aspect) and the method of Unified Graphic Visualization of Activity (UGVA, functional aspect) is taken as the basis. The steps of the process of superimposing data from the digital educational footprint on invariant graphic notations are described. The importance of ensuring the isomorphism of displaying the parameters of the learning situation when switching between maps and images is noted. Visualizations of CMKDs and anthropomorphic UGVA images are presented to illustrate examples from the real learning process. The advantages of the cross-cutting visual support for both the decision-making process and the synthesis of explanatory texts are shown.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-16072-1_42,en,Explainable Black Box Models,OriginalPaper,"The idea that black box models are unexplainable has been elevated to an axiom. In contrast to explainable models, where the involved parameters have a certain meaning that is understandable, black box models rely on principles that have no other function than to produce sophisticated mappings. The lack of explainability is sometimes compensated by applying a so-called post-hoc explainability method. Such a method is supposed to extract some meaning from the separately constructed black box model, but this technique is criticized for several reasons. In this paper we argue that there is an alternative to explainable models and to post-hoc explainability, by representing explanations as variables at either the input side or the output side of a black box model. This results in explainable black box models, where explanations are unrelated to the working principles, but they are still part of that same black box model.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Lighting is one of the most relevant infrastructures due to its impact on modern societies, but it is also complex to manage them in cities since it involves a massive number of widespread posts and is costly as the result of the consumption of significant amounts of energy. In that regard, this work proposes a scalable framework to manage a significant huge number of lamp posts. Its purpose is to give support to collecting large amounts of sensor data to help to analyze and efficiently fit the light intensity level to the space the posts are covering. Luminosity sensors are used to optimize the intensity of light needed in the urban areas. The proposed framework explores the concept of smart cities by combining the data collected from sensors plugged into IoT (Internet-of-Things) devices.

Classification task is considered for the set of problems where images of Lyme disease symptoms were collected and structured in the open-access dataset with the different subsets of the whole dataset: clean images only (C), dirty images only (D), and clean and dirty images in the equal proportions (C_D) ( https://www.kaggle.com/yoctoman/lyme-clean-and-dirty ) . Two different data preprocessing techniques were applied: normalization without data augmentation (NODA) and normalization with data augmentation (DA). The two versions of the modern NASNet DNN architectures of different sizes were used, namely NASNetLarge and NASNetMobile, with the weights obtained after training on ImageNet dataset. These DNNs were trained in two experiments, namely with frozen layers, aka transfer learning (TL), and with unfrozen layers when all weights were updated (NOTL). After fivefold cross-validated training the best results for mean validation metrics were demonstrated by the models trained in C_NOTL_NODA, C_NOTL_DA, and C_TL_NODA experiments for NASNetLarge, and in C_TL_NODA by NASNetMobile. But the testing on the new unknown subset of Lyme disease images with the equal proportion of clean and dirty images gave quite different results. The models trained in the before-mentioned experiments demonstrated poor performance in comparison with the models trained in C_NOTL_DA, D_NOTL_DA experiments, and, especially in D_C_NOTL_DA ones. The successful training strategy should include tuning ImageNet-trained weights without their freezing (NOTL) and intensive data augmentation (DA), but it would not be enough if some diverse relevant background will not be added. That is why the additional methods of “context-relevant data augmentation” (CRDA) mimicked by inclusion of D_C data configuration should be considered. These findings can be used for the more effective selection of training experiments of DNNs in the healthcare context in the view of the small number of available medical data in practice.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

The goal is to design an allocation mechanism such that each worker is incentivized to invite her neighbours to join the allocation, although they are competing for the task. Moreover, the performance of each worker is uncertain, which is modelled as the quality level of her task execution. The literature has proposed solutions to tackle the uncertainty problem by paying them after verifying their execution. Here, we extend the problem to the network setting. The challenge is that the requester relies on the workers to invite each other to find the best worker, and the performance of each worker is also unknown to the task requester. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism to solve the two challenges at the same time. The mechanism guarantees that inviting more workers and reporting/performing according to her true ability is a dominant strategy for each worker. We believe that the new solution can be widely applied in the digital economy powered by social connections such as crowdsourcing and contests.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Bitcoin is an example of cryptocurrency that has grow enormously since 2020 despite being in the market since 2009. However, cryptocurrencies are volatile and sensitive to thousands of factors and consequently is complex for humans to make predictions even more when those predictions should occur in a daily basis, requiring hence a significant effort. Due to this fact, investor profiles prefer long-term investments which can constraint their revenues. To overcome the aforementioned scenario this work proposes a scalable framework relying in Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict the price of bitcoin by automatically collecting and cleaning the data directly from the Web to process the dataset as input for training. This framework can also leverage new business models at scale by assisting the investors aiming realize its value in short periods in a continuous fashion.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In addition, VLE facilitates access to teaching resources, which facilitate the monitoring of teacher activities and interaction between students and teachers. Therefore, the online environment can assess the factors that lead to an increase or decrease in the academic performance of students. Machine Learning approaches are used for the cognitive behavior and academic performance of students in Virtual Learning. There is still no decision on the parameters to be adopted for the evaluation of virtual teaching as each student may submit the same type of assignment and same Practical files, and can have the same attendance. In such a case, evaluation of a student’s academic performance became tough. So we need to adopt some LMS which records various actions of the learners and the teachers like Quiz Submitted On-time/Late, Number of Assignment Submitted On-time/Late, Number of Discussions attended, Number of CA attended, and Practical Submitted On-time/Late, Internet connectivity, etc. So, there is a need for a framework that accounts for all of these parameters’ consideration so that a Predictive model can be designed for Forecasting/estimation performance of students that are recommended system should be framed for enhancing the academic performance of the learner.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

During winter, expert pruners are employed to remove certain primary branches of dormant trees based on a set of predefined rules. The end goal of the automatic pruning applications is to reduce dependence on this huge labor and associated humongous costs by automating the pruning decisions, which in turn would facilitate easy interface with intelligent robotic pruners. In this chapter, we have developed a robust 3D reconstruction scheme that utilizes color information in addition to the time-of-flight depth data from Kinect2 sensor for accurately modeling the trunk and primary branches of a dormant apple tree. The motivation behind incorporating color in our framework is to acquire accurate 3D tree reconstruction even in absence of quality depth data. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons of our proposed approach with a depth based reconstruction technique depicts the usefulness of using color information in our automatic pruning system. On average, the proposed scheme provides a performance of 93.94% accuracy for correctly identifying the branches, and 71.13 and 89.26% for correctly estimating the diameters of the primary branches within error margins of 3 mm and 5 mm respectively. Moreover, the time complexity of our proposed algorithm shows an improvement in order of magnitude over the complexity of the baseline approach.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Food Science']"

Considering the above problems, this paper proposes a SOD algorithm with the fusion of RGB image and eye tracking data. The specific methods are as follows: (1) The eye tracking data can well simulate the human visual selection attention mechanism and contains high-level semantic information, so the eye fixation points are integrated into the salient object detection algorithm. (2) Considering the different characteristics of high-level features and low-level features, an improved cascade decoder including channel cascaded decoder (CCD) and spatial cascaded decoder (SCD) is designed. Moreover, the cross-modal fusion module (CMFM) is employed to better fuse the eye tracking data and the RGB image features.

Artificial intelligence, robotics technology, the Internet of Things, big data drastically transform all types of transport and logistics operations. Moreover, in addition to digitalization, this sector turned out to be influenced by a wave of public concern over the ecological state of the planet. A powerful impetus was given by a recent climate change conference in Glasgow, following the results of which the governments of many countries undertook a commitment to ensure a net zero carbon footprint over the coming decades. Thousands of companies have declared their allegiance to ESG principles and readiness to work for a green economy. The prospects for the development of the industry are also influenced by changes in consumer behavior. New generation—digital natives, are ready to give up private cars, using instead car sharing service, switch to bicycles and kick scooters and buy environmentally friendly electric cars. However, in the beginning of 2022 the world has met new challenges and risks brought by the new geopolitical situation after the start of the war of Russia in Ukraine. The event resulted in the immediate disruption of many logistic channels, the consequences of which are beyond prediction at the moment. Even after the military activities cease it may take significant time to restore the disrupted connections. The study is based on the use of qualitative comparative analysis that identifies the impact of digitalization on the subsectors of the transport industry. The purpose of the study is to analyze the impact of the main digital transformation tools, as well as other impact factors (decarbonization, changes in behavioral stereotypes, COVID-19, etc.) on the development of transport: road, rail, sea and air transport. The transport industry is viewed through the lens of “Mobility as a Service” (MaaS). The research is focused on revolutionary changes in the development of the industry, which will result in structural changes in value added chains, shifts in the geography of the deployment of production facilities, the further spread of electronic document flow and payments, the growth in the use of electric cars and autonomous vehicles, robotization of warehouses and port infrastructure, the introduction of the Internet of Things in traffic control. The result of the study was the conclusion that the digitalization process in transport will develop, having an impact on other sectors of the economy. It was determined that these processes are irreversible, and companies engaged in transport operations and those working in related fields must adapt to changes: develop their own business models or adapt to existing ones. At the same time, the industry is only in the early stages of digitalization, the rate of changes and their consequences are not yet determined.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

So, many researchers have been interested in the Internet of things so that every appliance should be autonomous. Smart home technology is one of them. It involves certain electrical and electronic systems in a building with some degree of computerized or automated control. It can control elements of our home environments (e.g. light, fans, electrical devices, and safety systems). We propose an approach that fully controlled the home appliances by chatbot technology. In our research, the system can extract the device name such as light, fan, etc. using synonyms. In the device name extraction part, we use Jaro-Winkler string matching algorithms. We have also used the Naive Bayes algorithm to take command for action. Finally, a Firebase-based system connects the users and controls hardware.

Previous neuroscience studies have proved that MDD patients have altered structural and functional connectivity between different brain regions compared to normal individuals. Measuring brain activities via electroencephalography (EEG) is a cost-effective and appropriate method for the detection of mental disorders such as depression. In addition, as deep learning (DL) is gaining attention in various research fields, increasing DL methods have been presented to diagnose depression. Inspired by these angles, this paper proposed an end-to-end spatial convolutional neural network (CNN) called DSNet for depression classification based on the resting-state EEG signals. Evaluated on a public dataset, our model obtained better classification performance with the accuracy of 91.69% via the leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation strategy compared to other DL models. The experimental results demonstrate that DSNet can effectively extract information on spatial differences between depressed and normal individuals and could be a potential model for MDD detection.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Applications', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Mathematics of Computing']"

However, the heterogeneous nature of polyps poses a significant challenge in the segmentation task, and it is still an unsolved problem. So in this study, we have proposed a deep learning network, namely “a spatial attention-based residual M-Net for polyp segmentation” (SARM-Net). The network is inspired by the M-Net architecture, where some additional modules are added to the existing architecture to improve the segmentation performance. We have employed residual connections in the M-Net architecture to preserve gradient information during backpropagation, facilitating optimal gradient flow. Meanwhile, unlike M-Net, where the contextual information is directly fed from the encoder to the decoder by skip connections, a spatial attention block (SAB) is introduced in our proposed network to focus on the relevant significant features and ignore the redundant features in the spatial dimension prior to the concatenation which will facilitate better optimization of the network. The segmentation performance was evaluated on the “Kvasir-SEG” database. The experimental results reflect the segmentation performance improvement compared to the traditional deep learning models and a recent state-of-the-art method.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Information Storage and Retrieval']"

IoT technology is reshaping the traditional healthcare system by incorporating technology into it. In this article, a IoT layered architecture have been proposed with three different layers. The detailed working of all three layers is explained. A novel IoTFEC-19 framework has been proposed to detect COVID-19 suspects early with sensors and wearable devices. The Framework consists of three layers: Sensing Layer or Data Collection Layer, Data Analytics Layer, and Prediction Layer. In Sensing Layer, different sensors are used to collect the data and send it for analysis. In Analysis Layer, the level of symptoms is calculated from the data received from the Sensing Layer. The third layer is the Prediction Layer, in which prediction is made from the computed values in Analysis Layer, whether the suspected may be COVID-19 positive or negative. The last layer is the cloud layer used for storage services and data used for further analysis. The proposed IoTFEC framework aims to detect the COVID-19 suspected early, provide early treatment, and stop further spreading.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']"

In intelligent environments, where sensitive information must be preserved, the challenge becomes two-fold: i) approaching the critical personal data to the user to promote privacy (i.e., Edge Computing); and ii) adaptatively modulating users’ participation throughout the time. For this reason, this work proposes an interactive approach based on a cascade of Machine Learning models that makes optimized decisions related to classifying individual data and labelling it. For the evaluated use-case of a Human Activity Recognition system, the initial quantitative results of the proposed strategy show that an interactive cascade of simpler models can improve the non-interactive approach used as a benchmark and, at the same time, modulate the degree of participation of the user, measured as the number of times they would be inquired to provide a new label for newly obtained data. Thus, this paper provides insights into how this approach may be used in designing intelligent systems to adapt to the role of users in the personalization of intelligent models and how to build flexible experiences and learning systems where the user feels involved. All this while maintaining the privacy requirements that apply to Edge Intelligence and Edge Computing concepts.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Spike trains and local field potentials (LFPs) are two typical intracortical neural signals with good complementarity from time and frequency domains. However, existing studies mostly focused on a single type of signal, and the interaction between the two signals has not been well studied. This study proposes a temporal-spectral transformer network (TSNet) to model the temporal (with spikes), spectral (with LFPs), and mutual (with both signals) connections in spike-LFPs towards robust neural decoding. Experiments with clinical neural signals demonstrate that the attention-based connection model enables the dynamic temporal-spectral compensation in spike and LFP signals, which improves the robustness against temporal shifts and noises in neural decoding.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Applications', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Mathematics of Computing']"

In addition, a novel artificial intelligence (AI) framework is designed in order to optimize the sensor selection in real-time. This assists in determining pressure and temperature in the reservoir, and characterizes the formation. The framework consists of an artificial intelligence technique that estimates sensor data uncertainty, and subsequently optimizes the selection of the sensors.

",OriginalPaper,"Charles Darwin postulated the concept of “survival-of-the-fittest” and evolution in general. He discussed how nature selects the best candidate under different situations who are fit enough to survive and reproduce. This analogy has inspired many computational scientists, bioinformaticians, and computational biologists to develop techniques that can learn, adapt, and evolve to find optimal solutions for complex problems. Biologists are heavily dependent on computational methods and strategies to analyze humongous biological and medical data. Nature-inspired computing (NIC) encapsulates an ensemble of myriad studies of computer science, statistics, mathematics, and biological sciences where the essence is to adapt and develop robust competing techniques just like nature. It is a novel approach to optimization algorithms that are motivated by the dynamics of the biological evolution of our natural milieu. Over the past decade, various nature-inspired optimization algorithms have been deployed to solve complex problems in bioinformatics, engineering, and other sciences. With the glorious artificial intelligence (AI) revolution in biological sciences, there have been times when some problems are nonlinear in nature with multiple constraints and some techniques are hard to deploy. To solve high dimensionality issues and time complexity in such cases, NIC algorithms are the best choice to be used to solve complex optimization problems. This chapter highlights the commonly used NIC algorithms and their applications in biological sciences and bioinformatics.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Health Informatics', 'Cancer Research', 'Genetics and Genomics', 'Bioinformatics']"

However, if they left their jobs suddenly, it might cost a company a lot of money. Consequently, companies nowadays are actively seeking tools and technologies that can help in accurate and early employee attrition prediction. The main focus here shall be on the visualization of the available employee data in order to gain intuitive insights on the correlation among attributes and top causes behind the attrition. In this paper, we present the comparison of four algorithms used to predict whether an employee will leave or not, based on various attributes like age, salary, experience, etc., along with intuitive visualizations and its importance. The models used for prediction are random forest, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, and Naïve Bayes classifier. Thus, the visual analysis of employee attrition problem and accurate prediction can allow HR managers to take precautionary actions to retain the employee within the company.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Communication Networks', 'Computer Applications', 'Computer System Implementation', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

With the help of satellites and manned aircraft, surveys are carried out in order to determine the areas planted with different crops. This is done for different purposes, and the methods used are expensive and time-consuming, which has restricted their use to very special cases. For small farmers, determining the planting areas for different species could lead to better coordination and distribution of the supply of agricultural products. The main objective of this work is to explore the use of drones to capture images, and Deep Learning pre-trained models techniques to classify crops in small areas, in order to provide a solution to problems related to the estimation of planting areas, for different horticultural products grown on a small scale. This is an exploratory work, in which the Detectron2 Zoo was evaluated. Detectron2 has been developed by Facebook IA and offers a great number of pre-trained models. These models can serve in many object detection tasks, and evaluating their performance might be the first step in the search for a practical solution to many problems, before building a model from scratch. In this work, we did not make changes to the architectures of the original models, but we explored some variations of the corresponding hyperparameters. We selected three classes of areas to detect in our experiments: uncultivated areas (no crop), green onion crops (onion), and foliage flowers crops (foliage). The results show that it is possible to detect small-scale crops and classify them with the help of Detectron2 models. However, we would still have to perform further evaluations in order to compare these models with other state-of-the-art methods, and we would still have to modify the architectures of these models in order to improve their performance. In future work, it is recommended to delve into aspects such as the count of plants in order to determine their quantity with greater precision and thus being able to carry out planning activities in a much more efficient way.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Keeping the food from spoiling bits helps keep food from spoiling and reduces incidental losses in the business. An Internet of Things (IoT)-based framework for food monitoring is proposed in this paper to protect food from spoilage caused by changes in environmental conditions during storage. In the current scenario, the prediction was made using recorded sensed data, and a detailed analysis was performed to identify the factors causing the food to spoil. This chapter proposes an automated controlling mechanism for environmental parameters using Adaptive Random Forest prediction and IoT. Environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, moisture, light, and so on, which affect the nutritional value of food, are considered in the proposed work. All sensed data would be stored on the cloud, and analysis will be performed to predict the environmental condition at the storage location to avoid food spoilage by changing to the appropriate environmental condition. In the proposed work, the Random Forest Optimizer method is used to predict the state of food if it is fresh or not at the location where food is stored, harmful changes are monitored, and action is taken to provide appropriate conditions at the stored location.

In this chapter, the results of the study are compared with state-of-the-art systems from classical application environments for robots, like the deep-sea and space. Here, systems have to interact with their environment to a large extent on their own over longer periods of time. Although typically the designs are such that humans are able to intervene in specific situations and so external decisions are possible, the requirements for autonomy are also extremely high.

The study analyzed 523,764 and 1,054,794 social media responses in Pre-COVID and COVID eras respectively. Due to the large volume of the data, for Pre-COVID era, responses from August to December 2019 were considered. For COVID era, responses from January to June 2020 were taken into the account. The organic food categories, considered in the study were Snacks, Fruits, Vegetables, Beers & Alcohol, Meat, Flour, Dairy, Cereals & Savories, Health Drink, Noodles & Fast Food, Dessert and Pizza & Pasta. In the study three-stage filtering for Sentiment Analysis was performed (86.4% accuracy achieved) using Natural Language Processing, Manual analysis of sentiment and Bi-Directional Encoder Representations from Transforms based model. It was concluded that in Pre-COVID era, people were less aware about the health benefits of organic food but in COVID era, the awareness level of consumers rose exponentially about various organic food categories, especially about processed organic food categories and benefits of raw organic food categories. In Pre-COVID Era, consumers were mainly focused on fresh fruits and vegetables. In COVID Era, food categories like Dairy, Meat and Vegetables were at the top. Fruits, snacks, beer and alcohol were also in high demand. While analyzing the Pre-COVID and COVID scenarios, we observed a shift in consumer behaviour from raw organic food categories towards processed and semi-processed organic food categories. Organic noodles & fast food, dessert and health drinks still remained as the least preferred food categories. The study is unique since it provides a macro and micro view of shift in consumer behavior preferences in Pre-COVID and COVID eras using social media at various geographical locations worldwide. This research will help manufacturers of organic food to reshape their existing consumer behavior and market penetration strategies.

The challenge is mainly related to the capability of TSCS to ensure a quick detection and to suggest suitable decisions. Neural network has shown great potential in predicting traffic disturbance. In addition, smart clustering could be beneficial to ensure fast disturbance reaction while TSCS are providing control decisions. Moreover, the immune network approach has succeeded in controlling interrupted intersections. Motivated by these assumptions, we propose in this paper a disturbance mining approach based on the occurrence of traffic disturbances to ensure optimal signals control that minimizes traffic delay. Initially, the queue delay is calculated based on mutual information of different traffic scenarios. At that point, within the maximum traffic delay constraint, the feedforward neural network is considered to find the optimal traffic delay and maximize traffic fluidity. As a result, disturbances and related control decisions are clustered based on the calculated traffic delay. Our approach helped the immune network control system (INCS) by prompting it with faster reaction and lower traffic delay compared to its classical version.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This study is motivated by the observation that the insurance companies in Palestine are highly levered and the insurance activities are concentrated in the automobile industry, and it is unknown if this strategy is advantageous to the company. The moderating influence of product and claim diversity on the link between capital structure and financial performance in this paper is a contribution to the existing literature. To estimate the study’s model, balanced panel data from seven insurance companies operating in Palestine from 2010 to 2018 was used. The findings demonstrate that leverage has a negative influence on insurance firm performance, but this relationship is contingent on the degree of insurance portfolio diversification. Diversifying the insurance portfolio lessens the negative impact of financial leverage on financial performance. According to the findings, diversification allows insurance companies to accept more risks. The conclusions of the study advise management to concentrate on the product and claim diversification as a means of reducing financial risk.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Business Information Systems']"

To improve patients’ life expectancy, an early and accurate discovery of tumors is the first step, and categorization is used for a more accurate diagnosis of the tumor. Brain tumor identification is the most demanding and intriguing thing to conduct in medical image processing. Tumor location, size, shape, type, and contrast of tumor tissues are used in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). In the instance of brain imaging analysis, a machine learning algorithm is a feasible option. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is now the most common and effective approach for image categorization utilizing brain magnetic resonance imaging. It is, however, sluggish and lacking accuracy. The application of this well-known technology is DNN which is a model that is modified in the feature-extraction and segmentation phases to increase accuracy. This work presents a unique approach of detecting and classifying brain tumors from MRI scans of patients utilizing deep learning methods, as well as CNN for classification. The proposed system is made up of many steps, including pre-processing, feature extraction, segmentation, tumor detection, and tumor classification. MRI pictures were chosen because they outperform other imaging modalities in terms of brain tumor analysis. The MRI image datasets for testing and training would be derived from WHO medical image databases. In this also discusses other image processing approaches. Following a study of the comparative research, this is an extension of earlier studies that identifies and classifies tumors with more accuracy, sensitivity, and precision, shorter processing time with bigger datasets, and better performance than other systems that employed SVM and ANN classifiers.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Cognitive Psychology', 'Personality and Social Psychology', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

A relatively contagious disease unfolded through the SARS-CoV-2 virus that travelled throughout the globe and was declared an epidemic by WHO in March 2020. The need of examining the scenario became the inducement behind this research. The assessment of COVID-19 in India is performed from 1 April 2020 to 20 May 2021 which amassed a total of 415 instances. Further, preprocessing of the dataset is executed with the use of normalization. The experimentation is executed through the use of four ensemble strategies which are bagging, boosting, stacking and voting with four distinct machine learning algorithms linear regression, sequential minimal optimizer for regression, multilayer perceptron and Gaussian process. The splitting of the dataset is completed at 75%, and machine learning algorithms with ensemble techniques are applied. Linear regression with the bagging ensemble method gives satisfactory outcomes with the correlation coefficient of 0.935 and 0.919 for confirmed cases and recovered cases, respectively, and Gaussian process presented the best results for deceased cases. In the case of ensemble strategies, bagging indicates the best correlation coefficient in each case. Therefore, with the help of the three best algorithms, confirmed cases, recovered cases and deceased cases predictions are performed. The paper has potential implementations that can foresee the COVID-19 confirmed cases, recovered cases and deceased cases based on historic data and subsequently structure the plan for the future.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Information Storage and Retrieval']"

We hypothesize that ‘pain-free’ aged intervertebral discs even though structurally intact show certain histological changes similar to the pathological ‘painful’ disc removed at surgery matched thorough grade of degeneration; however, blood vessels ingrowths are a distinct feature of ‘painful disc’. To analyses the tissues differences with accuracy, confocal system and volocity image analysis tool was used for assessments of images, to develop a predictive tool compatible to be used with macroscopic images. Sixty intervertebral disc tissue samples were collected from lower lumbar regions, and 30 discs tissue were from the patient’s undergoing surgeries due to ‘pain’ while 30 discs were from non-degenerated ‘pain-free’ structurally intact disc samples. Histological and confocal analysis was used to score the images, and the confirmatory changes was matched with grades of degeneration. The results indicate blood vessels and inflammatory cells into the discs are confined to fissures and disrupted regions in ‘painful disc’ in the oaf and the iaf regions, while ‘pain-free’ disc shows fissures devoid of any vessels. Age-related changes were mainly in the form of cell clusters and loss of proteoglycans. The source of pain thus seems to be focal and correspond to fissured or delaminated outer and inner annulus regions of the intervertebral discs.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Information Storage and Retrieval']"

The competitor to boxing has recently risen in the form of mixed martial arts (MMA), which is becoming quite a famous sport, most notably recognized due to the Ultimate Fighting Championship promotion (UFC). As with most other competitive sports, it is never obvious who will emerge as the winner of a specific MMA bout, as the sport is very unpredictable by nature. This paper focuses on using machine learning (ML) algorithms and classifiers to predict the winners of MMA bouts in the Ultimate Fighting Championship promotion. The data used to train and test the algorithms and classifiers is sampled from the rich UFC database which includes details from all bouts that have taken place in the UFC throughout the history of the promotion. The predictions are obtained without using any data that can directly indicate the winner of a bout. The results are presented through accuracy percentages for two different types of sample sets. Successful bout prediction percentages range from 80% to just over 92% across all subsets. This model can be further expanded and modified to predict the winner for future matchups in the promotion.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

One of the applications of ML is biochemistry. Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary science that uses computers and communication science to understand biological data. One of its most difficult tasks is to distinguish between regular genes and disease-causing genes. The classification of gene sequences into existing categories is utilized in genomic research to discover the functions of novel proteins. As a result, it is critical to identify and categorize such genes. We employ ML approaches to distinguish between infected and normal genes using classification methods. AdaBoost has a high degree of precision; relative to the bagging algorithm and Random Forest Algorithm, AdaBoost fully considers the weight of each classifier. To generate a sequence of weak classifiers, an AdaBoost-based learning approach is used to find the most ‘informative’ or ‘discriminating’ features. The identification cascade structure can also help to limit false-positive results. This study provides an overview of the mechanics of gene sequence classification using ML Techniques, including a brief introduction to bioinformatics and important challenges in DNA Sequencing with ML.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

This review paper focuses on the ECG signal analysis. While recording the ECG signal, there may be many types of noise present. Even the heat generated in the electronic device also cause noise. So, this noise must be eliminated in order to extract the exact ECG signal so that correct treatment can be done. For this purpose, filtering techniques can be used. Depending on the noise that has been present in the ECG signal, the filter has to be chosen accordingly.

Traditionally, engineers or experts are required to inspect and assess the tunnel structure on site regularly. But most of the assessment are subjective and qualitative, failing to achieve reasonable assessment and accurate tunnel maintenance operation. Therefore, some quantitative methods, such as Tunnel Servility Index (TSI), are proposed. However, TSI method only assesses the current condition of a tunnel, without considering its historical monitoring data. With the development of geotechnical engineering, large amount of monitoring data has been recorded. These data are multi-source heterogeneous, making it rather difficult to store and analyse. Database technology, especially Knowledge Graph (KG), is good at storing, managing and mining multi-source heterogeneous data. Based on KG, all data related to tunnel structure can be stored and then taken into account when making assessment; besides, the information of a tunnel from its construction to the present can be recorded in the knowledge graph. In the paper, monitoring data of Shanghai Metro Line 1 is stored in Neo4j, a graph database, to form the metro tunnel knowledge graph. Based on the KG, the metro tunnel is assessed by a dynamic assessment model based on TSI method. The hided statistic relationships among defects are also deduced. Through the application of KG on Shanghai Metro Line 1, the dynamic assessment model is proposed to be effective, reliable and advanced.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Statistics, general']"

Generally physical inspections are carried out to detect defects in structures for further rectification. With recent advancements in computational algorithms, machine vision based inspection is emerging as an efficient technique for monitoring structural health of structures. Surface cracks in concrete structures are one of the important indicators of its health and enable the assessment of serviceability of the structures. The present work aims to address the issue by developing a novel system using machine vision and deep learning. A convolutional neural network-based methodology is developed to detect surface cracks in concrete cube images. The implementation of proposed methodology is demonstrated through monitoring of crack development in concrete cubes of size 150 × 150 × 150 mm with different compression strengths. The concrete cubes are subjected to compression loading in a standard compression testing machine. The analysis results in location, area, length, and number of cracks in synchronization with the applied compression load. The number of cracks, area of cracks, and length of cracks with respect to compression load are acquired using the developed system for different grades of concrete cubes. Results show that cracks detection and monitoring have been accurately performed with the developed system. The observations obtained from the crack load analysis can be very useful for improved understanding of concrete behaviour. The data acquired and observations can help professionals for improved structural health monitoring.","['Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences']"

For this reason, a public dataset, containing 1,561 endoscopy images, is used in this work to evaluate the behavior of a deep neural network in order to classify esophageal disorders. Grouped as normal (images without anatomical alterations, controls) class 0, with 570 images; patients with Barrett’s esophagus in class 1, 328; patients with grade A esophagitis, 403 images; and patients with class 3 esophagitis with grade B-D, 260 images.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-16237-4_3,en,Machine Learning Assessment: Implications to Cybersecurity,OriginalPaper,"After discussing the construction of machine learning (ML) algorithms in the previous chapter, this chapter is dedicated to their assessment and performance estimation (with an emphasis on classification assessment), a topic that is equally important specially in the context of cyberphysical security design. The literature is full of nonparametric methods to estimate a statistic from just one available dataset through resampling techniques, e.g., jackknife, bootstrap and cross validation (CV). Special statistics of great interest are the error rate and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of a classification rule. The importance of these resampling methods stems from the fact that they require no knowledge about the probability distribution of the data or the construction details of the ML algorithm. This chapter provides a concise review of this literature to establish a coherent theoretical framework for these methods that can estimate both the error rate (a one-sample statistic) and the AUC (a two-sample statistic). The resampling methods are usually computationally expensive, because they rely on repeating the training and testing of a ML algorithm after each resampling iteration. Therefore, the practical applicability of some of these methods may be limited to the traditional ML algorithms rather than the very computationally demanding approaches of the recent deep neural networks (DNN). In the field of cyberphysical security, many applications generate structured (tabular) data, which can be fed to all traditional ML approaches. This is in contrast to the DNN approaches, which favor unstructured data, e.g., images, text, voice, etc.; hence, the relevance of this chapter to this field.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Fog computing, also known as fogging, is an architecture that uses edge devices to carry out a substantial amount of computation (edge computing), storage, and communication locally and route it over the internet backbone. An error in the physical signal causes data in a packet to get corrupted. Such corruption - most often detected at the link layer - causes the entire datagram to be discarded. Consequential packet loss leads to poor performance, lag, jitter and reduced throughput. The proposed research in this paper focuses on the mechanism of image processing that transfers graphical content over the fog environment. The major objective of our research is the minimization of packet dropping and error rate in this transmission. To achieve this objective the graphical content is split after compression to reduce the content size.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Business Information Systems']"

Nevertheless, the training of state-of-the-art neural network models is usually based on the availability of large sets of supervised data. Indeed, deep neural networks have a huge number of parameters which, to be properly trained, require a fairly large dataset of supervised examples. This problem is particularly relevant in the medical field due to privacy issues and the high cost of image tagging by medical experts. In this chapter, we present a new approach that allows to reduce this limitation by generating synthetic images with their corresponding supervision. In particular, this approach can be applied in semantic segmentation, where the generated images (and label-maps) can be used to augment real datasets during network training. The main characteristic of our method, differently from other existing techniques, lies in the generation procedure carried out in multiple steps, based on the intuition that, by splitting the procedure in multiple phases, the overall generation task is simplified. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-stage approach has been evaluated on two different domains, retinal fundus and chest X-ray images. In both domains, the multi-stage approach has been compared with the single-stage generation procedure. The results suggest that generating images in multiple steps is more effective and computationally cheaper, yet allowing high resolution, realistic images to be used for training deep networks.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Health Informatics']"

This publication presents a table for PID parameters that can be used to control systems with time-delayed, stable step responses. This minimizes the common quality criteria in the time domain, IAE, ITAE and ISE. The determination of the parameter sets is very computationally intensive. Therefore, an approach from the field of artificial intelligence was chosen for their calculation.

In a statistical sense, this means that statistics and models derived and learned from data are insensitive to individual observations. Differential Privacy as defined by Cynthia Dwork in (Dwork 2006) has become a popular approach for ensuring privacy. In contrast to earlier definitions, Dwork defined differential privacy as a relative guarantee that nothing more could be learned from data whether an individual observation is included or excluded from the analysis. This was achieved by adding random noise that is bigger than the effect of a change due to the largest single participant. The approach was referred as 𝜖-differential privacy. Such an actionable definition gave more room for practitioners to define how, for example, machine learning algorithms can ensure differential privacy. In this paper, we present an umbrella review on differential privacy related studies based on a methodology proposed by Aromataris et al. (Int J Evidence-Based Healthcare 13(3):132–140, 2015).","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Privacy', 'Cryptology', 'Mobile and Network Security']"

Large-scale molecular-biology-level information, such as genome, proteome, and metabolome, is collected from patients for analyzing biomarkers for subpopulation of a particular disease. This is import for the targeted therapy, which is expected to be more effective and less harmful to normal cells than traditional chemotherapy. Meanwhile, due to the rapid development in medical imaging and machine learning technology, we are able to extract more and more “unseen” disease characteristics from medical images. Radiomics, a method that extracts a large number of features from medical images, has been established for a variety of purposes such as a prediction of risks for a particular disease, classification of lesions, a prediction of outcome of patients, etc. Genetic tests can provide prognostic information in breast cancer for both diagnosis and treatment planning. In this study, we developed a radiogenomics method to discover imaging biomarkers on breast MRI for prediction of genetic test results for breast cancer by means of our original sequential forward floating selection (SFFS) coupled with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier that maximizes the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC). Our proposed method aimed at predicting the results of the 95-gene classifier (95-GC) and immune-related 23-gene signature (IRSN-23), which consists of a feature extraction from a tumor region, discovery of biomarkers based on our SFFS feature selection method, and an SVM classifier operated on the discovered imaging biomarkers. Our database contained 118 dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) breast MRI studies from 118 patients. We extracted 318 morphological and texture features from each segmented tumor region on DCE MRI in three phases (i.e., pre-contrast, early phase, and delayed phase). We achieved an AUC value of 0.97 with 22 discovered imaging biomarkers in predicting the results of 95-GC and that of 0.96 with 24 imaging biomarkers in predicting the results of IRSN-23 in a five-fold cross-validation test.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Health Informatics']"

Their main feature is the capability of processing graph structured data with minimal loss of structural information. This makes GNNs the ideal family of models for processing a wide variety of biological data: metabolic networks, structural formulas of molecules, and proteins are all examples of biological data that are naturally represented as graphs. As an example, GNNs were employed, with very good results, for the prediction of protein-protein interactions. This was achieved by applying a clique detection model on graphs representing the interaction of the secondary structures of pairs of proteins. The introduction of composite GNN models, designed for processing heterogeneous graphs, has allowed researchers to study even more complex networks. For instance, drug side-effects were predicted based on a graph describing the interactions between drugs and human genes. Another very important innovation was brought by generative models, that were introduced for graph data after the success of generative models for images. In particular, GNNs were used to build a sequential model for the generation of potential drug candidates, in the form of molecular graphs, with the purpose of enhancing existing drug discovery techniques. The increasing accuracy and efficacy of these models, as well as the development of more complex biological databases, ensure even more interesting future developments in the application of GNNs to biological data.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Health Informatics']"

Recent research on picture encryption methods have increasingly been based on chaotic systems, although in one-dimensional chaotic cryptosystems there are apparent disadvantages of a tiny key space and low security. The chaotic approach has been used to suggest a novel picture encryption algorithm to avoid the aforesaid limitation. A chaotic dynamic mechanism is employed in the synchronization of two chaotic systems and controllers. The picture is cramped by adding the chaotic sequence to the disturbance term associated with the plaintext. Then the dynamic index's cipher text feedback device is adopted at the diffusion stage. This means that the cipher text cipher index utilized to provide feedback is locative indexed. The proposed stenography with the chaotic map technology, as regards the time required to mark a certain collection of images and with greater space, smaller iteration times and high security analysis such as key space analysis, statistical analysis and sensitivity analysis, is simpler and more effective. Image encryption is accompanied with a confused logic to create a secret key. In addition, experimental findings like key space analysis, analysis of key sensitivity, differential analysis, histogram, entropy information and correlation coefficients reveal a safe and reliable image encryption technique with significant potential for application.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Information Storage and Retrieval']"

One of the most challenging tasks in the Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is to recognize human emotions by electroencephalography (EEG) signals.

However, different scenarios have various sensitivities to each parameter, researchers prefer algorithms that solve the problem to output non-dominated solution sets. NSGA-II, a genetic algorithm, has become one of the most contacted algorithms for solving the QWSCP problem due to its ability to search for non-dominated solution sets. However, NSGA-II algorithm still suffers from the challenge of slow convergence and the tendency to fall into local optimum solutions. In adjusting the NSGA-II mutation probabilities, it was found that the setting of the mutation probabilities affects the effectiveness of the algorithm, and that the optimal mutation probabilities for different loci are related to the distribution of data for that locus. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved NSGA-II-AMO algorithm, which uses an adaptive mutation operator to complete the mutation process when generating children in the NSGA-II algorithm, so that the mutation probability adaptively changes with different distributions of data, effectively improving the search speed at the beginning of population iteration; at the same time, in order to avoid the problem of oscillatory search at a later stage, AMO reduces the mutation probability as the population converges, preventing the re-introduction of inferior genes into the population. We compare the NSGA-II-AMO algorithm cross-sectionally with the PSO algorithm, the NSGA-II algorithm and the ABC algorithm, and the adaptive mutation operator achieves improved convergence with guaranteed distributivity.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

As a result of the analysis, first, the environment (E) area was evaluated as the most important task for all surveyors at 47.6%. In the evaluation items by area, 34.4% for pollution and waste in the environmental (E) area, 28.8% for human rights in the social (S) area, and 37.1% for ethical management in the governance (G) area were evaluated as the most important tasks. Next, looking at the total weight results for each evaluation item, pollution and waste (16.3%) were found to be the most important tasks. Second, the result was that corporate officials gave a relatively 6–7% more weight to related laws and regulatory violations such as environmental laws and regulatory violations than legislative officials. This can be interpreted that corporate officials are paying more attention to legal risks caused by regulatory violations due to excessive punishment for companies and anti-corporate sentiment.

It has been widely used to address various issues to understand human language by computers. It has been utilized to pre-process unstructured data and investigate authoritative records to help in legitimate decision-making. The majority of data found in the Indian legal system are unstructured. Various courts disperse legal documents by genuinely dissecting the data of particular cases and getting the choice from perspectives decisions and the rule regulation. Legal professionals’ traditional way of analysing, and making decisions is time-consuming. Hence, in this paper, the authors have focused to fabricate a text pre-handling procedure on authoritative reports to eliminate undesirable texts. The authors have proposed a methodology to pre-process legal documents for content characterization, and text arrangement and examine their specialized commitments to find the major words found in legal documents. Natura language processing techniques like bag of words, count vectorization, etc., help to examine the catchphrases of the court procedures after removing the unwanted texts from legal documents to extract major words found in legal documents.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Statistics, general', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Sociology, general', 'Professional Computing']"

The stability of the feature selection process determines the sensitivity of the selection to dataset variation. In bioinformatics, a task of biomarker identification requires selection of disease associated genes (relevant feature subset), to be insensitive to the variations in the training set, which can give confidence to the domain experts and can prevent result manipulation in the real-world applications. Traditional feature selection strategies are ineffective to capture this high sensitivity to the numerous perturbations. This motivates the need of robust feature selection strategy which produces stable feature set across datasets from multiple domains.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Information Storage and Retrieval']"

Mitigating such pandemics can be done by maintaining social distance and avoiding overcrowding. In such conditions, self-taken measures like hand washing, environmental cleaning, facemask use, and avoiding overcrowding, and maintaining social distance are effective. It is suggested that by following these small steps, the spread of the virus could be minimized. This study uses OpenCV for both object detection and object tracking. Additionally, it is used to calculate social distance between people. An object tracking algorithm is used to identify people's presence movement detection through PIR sensor, whereas the human face detection is tracked by camera module. The standard distance for calculating distance is six feet because it is the distance needed to maintain social distance. Models were trained and then used for both object detection and object tracking, with the most popular one being OpenCV. A custom dataset was created for training this model, and it was used to understand and identify the human face. In addition to detecting and tracking people accurately, the developed model can be applied in other areas of research where humans are the primary focus, for instance, self-driving cars, crowd analysis, or any other type of research that prioritizes human detection. A significant challenge is that people behave in unpredictable ways during gatherings, so the proposed system might prove powerful in dealing with people's unpredictable behavior. In the present study, we evaluate if the distance between people in halls is maintained and estimate the number of people gathering in those halls.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Big Data', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks']"

In particular, the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the spread of online learning and its significance. However, this wave of innovation in the education field has revealed the lack of research on how online education should be systematically provided and which educational aspects should be considered to enhance learner satisfaction in online settings. With the recent emergence of the Metaverse, VR education is once again proposed as a major tool for online learning despite existing limitations in research which put both systematic and educational aspects into consideration. Hence, this study presents and discusses a research model that converges technology acceptance model, information systems success model, and self-determination theory with the purpose of exploring variables that affect learner satisfaction, mediating the flow theory. Results showed that most variables of both self-determination theory and information system quality within VR education impact learner satisfaction. In particular, learners’ flow—complete immersion in learning—functions as an important mediating variable for learner satisfaction.

The idea of DMAPF is to decompose a given MAPF problem into smaller sub-problems, then solve them in parallel. It has been shown that DMAPF can achieve higher scalability compared to centralized methods. This paper addresses two problems in the previous works. First, the previous works only divide problem maps in a simple, rectangular manner. This can create sub-problems with unbalanced numbers of locations in their maps when the shape of the original map is not rectangular or when the obstacles are not uniformly distributed. Having sub-problems that vary in sizes diminishes the effectiveness of parallelism. Second, the idea of DMAPF is to have agents move across sub-problems until they reach the sub-problems that contain their goals, but the previous works do not have a mechanism to regulate the number of agents residing in the sub-problems, thus it may fail to find the solution when a sub-problem is overcrowded. To mitigate the problems, we introduce ( i ) a method to decompose MAPF problems with balanced numbers of vertices; and ( ii ) a mechanism to regulate the number of agents in sub-problems. We also improve the performance of the Answer Set Programming (ASP) encoding, that was used in previous DMAPF implementations to solve MAPF sub-problem instances, by eliminating unnecessary parameters. The results show that the new solver scales better and is more efficient than the previous versions.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Recently developed question answering (QA) systems aim at providing direct answers to the user’s queries, hence, becoming of great interest to a large community. In this work, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that performs this task by creating a knowledge graph from the corpus.

The best examples are virtual assistants such as Siri, Alexa, Cortana, etc. Cognitive computing and AI play a big role in solving problems and building applications to support several domains in Internet of Things (IoT). The downside to AI and cognitive computing is the complexity of the architecture involved in building models that supports IoT. Toward the late 1960s, researchers came up with a technology called cloud computing that allowed individuals and organizations to make use of services provided by the cloud to solve problems. This meant that one no longer needed to worry about the software and hardware components required to develop intelligent models. Although cloud computing has been able to solve most complexity issues, it has several drawbacks of its own – latency, privacy, security, reliability, etc. Domains like healthcare rely on intelligent models to make important time-sensitive decisions and cannot wait for data to be shipped all the way to the cloud to get results. The need for quick and real-time results is what probed researchers to develop Edge Intelligence or Cognitive Computing at the Edge with IoT application services. Edge Intelligence is the deployment of intelligent computerized models close to the data source – on the edge node of an IoT network or very near to the network edge.

In this study, we propose a stochastic feed-forward attention network that consists of input feature level attention. The stochastic feed-forward attention network allows us to interpret the model by identifying the input features, dominant for prediction. In addition, the proposed model uses variational inferences to yield uncertainty information, which is a measure of the reliability of the interpretations.

The study was conducted with the aim of empirically identifying the operating principles of innovative behavior, developing universally applicable theories and models for innovative behavior, and providing an important theoretical basis for applying numerous management techniques to the reality. Due to the nature of individual’s intrinsic behavior research, it was prepared using an electronic self-report survey. Outliers were removed from the collected data and normality checks were accomplished to perform confirmatory factor analysis, and the causal relationship was verified using the structural equation model. As an analysis method, reliability was verified using the Cronbach alpha coefficient, and factor analysis was conducted to test the validity of the measurement variable. Competence, relationship, and autonomy, which are the main constituents of self-determination, play significant role on innovative behavior, while competence having a mediating effect on relationship and autonomy. Similarly, autonomy was found to have a moderating effect on relationship and competence. The results of this study provided an opportunity to identify the fundamental principles of innovative behavior and understand the phenomenon of corporate isomorphization. The coercive and normative isomorphism caused by changes in external systems and norms is understood as a simple adaptation rather than an innovation. On the other hand, the act of self-awareness and imitation of new standards in exchange with others presupposes the acceptance of more innovative ideas, so if only an autonomous environment is continuously provided, the expression of innovative behavior can be continuously induced.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The amount of convolutional and pooling layers in the stacked CNN is the same because each CAE contains a pooling layer and a convolutional layer in the encoder. State-of-the-art CNNs, on the other hand, have different amounts of convolutional and pooling layers. The constraint on the number of convolutional and pooling layers contained in CAEs ought to be lifted because the architecture of CNN is one of the important ingredients contributing to the final performance. However, because of the non-differentiable and non-convex properties in practice, it is intractable to determine optimal numbers for convolutional layers and pooling layers, which is related to NAS.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It allows us to talk about the transposition of the translator linguistic persona’s functions. The research aims at finding ways to integrate translation activities into a new communicative environment associated with digital platforms, with the development of new linguistic technologies in the process of transcultural communication. The methodological basis of the research is the concept of translation space based on a synergetic approach to translation, which assumes the harmonization of the source and target meanings, i.e., their coordination and proportionality. The result of the study is understanding the correlation between the subject-centric and text-centric functions of a human-translator developing their reflexive, empathic, and other cognitive abilities, which cannot be delegated to machine translation. Therefore, we observe the transposition process of the translator language persona’s functions when the translator retains all subject-centric functions, and part of the text-centric functions are performed by the translation software. At this time, the social and cultural responsibility of the translator increases since the translation is assigned by the human and performed for the human.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

However, identifying these cells poses a bottle-neck in the research of cancer cure as it is an extremely tedious job to manually isolate these from the rest of the cells in the tissue. Hence, the automation of this process using deep learning (DL)-based object detection and segmentation techniques such as Mask R-CNN will allow researchers and pathologists to save valuable time otherwise consumed in manually identifying these nuclei. The main objective of this research paper is to provide an instance segmentation technique to label and segment neoplastic cell nuclei from multiple instances of whole-slide images (WSI). For this process, a contemporary neural network architecture called the mask region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) was used. This proposed technique generates a pixel-wise binary mask. These masks are capable of segmenting these instances and facilitating the advancement of intelligent systems in medical imaging and computational pathology. This time can instead be devoted to developing better cures by conducting more research.

Previous work evaluated opinion propagation in a social network by using the probably approximately correct (PAC) learning framework and considered only binary opinions. In general, PAC learnability, i.e., the finiteness of the number of samples needed, is not guaranteed when generalizing from a binary-value model to a multi-value model. We show that the PAC learnability of multi-value opinions propagating in a social network. We first prove that the number of samples needed in a multi-opinion model is sufficient for $$(k-1)\log (k-1)$$ ( k - 1 ) log ( k - 1 ) times the number of samples needed in a binary-opinion model, when $$k~(\ge 3)$$ k ( ≥ 3 ) is the number of opinions. We next prove that the upper and lower bounds on the number of samples needed to learn a multi-opinion model can be determined from the Natarajan dimension, which is a generalization of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

doi:10.1007/978-981-19-0105-8_3,en,An Irrigation Support System Using Regressor Assembly,OriginalPaper,"In India, the agriculture sector uses about 84% of the total available water for irrigation. Most of the irrigation is surface-based, and nearly 40% of the irrigation water is wasted due to the unscientific practices adopted by the rural farmers to estimate the actual water demand of their crops. This practice leads to groundwater scarcity and high production costs of the crops. For precise irrigation, the estimation of water needed by a crop is the most significant factor. For proper estimation of irrigation water, the Food and Agriculture Organization recommends the Penman–Monteith method as the most scientific one. However, this method is very complex, involving several region-specific and climatic parameters. It is practically impossible for rural farmers to estimate the daily need for irrigation water using the Penman–Monteith method. As a practical alternative, an automated system is most desirable for rural farmers. This paper presents an irrigation support system to estimate the irrigation water required for a crop correctly. The system has been designed using an assembly of multiple regressors to get the best possible outcome. The outperformed regressor(s) is selected based on the performance evaluated using five standard metrics. This system will benefit rural farmers to estimate the exact quantity of irrigation water needed for a crop. The proposed system is an effective solution to encounter groundwater scarcity and lower the production cost of the crops.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics']"

After an overview of the evolution of these two aspects and the role of humans with their respect, we will frame the current and near-future developments according to the job demands-resources model, where humans’ well-being depends on the good balance between job demands (workload, stress, risks, etc.) and job resources, both personal (resilience, optimism, etc.) and job-related (organizational and technological support). Adaptive automation and artificial intelligence have the potential to become job resources rather than job demands, but only if a proper design is set. Central to the design is the notion of plasticity, i.e., the capacity of an element to adapt to changes in its coupling with interacting elements. We will discuss two forms of plasticity in the relationship between humans and technology. Short-term plasticity is mainly based on the immediate adaptation of technology to human needs and performance. The long-term plasticity is based on the co-evolution of humans and technology, where changes concern not just the mere performance, but wider and long-lasting aspects like knowledge, culture, identities, approaches, job frameworks. Organization is crucial to foster this kind of co-evolution, towards a new framework, called transfactory, where human needs and values govern the overall systems evolution.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Machine Learning', 'Robotics and Automation']"

Colonoscopies and the early removal of polys significantly increase the survival rate of this cancer, but this intervention depends on the accurate detection of polys in the surrounding tissues.

Traditional diagnosis of malaria involves examination of thin blood smear slides under a microscope by trained microscopists to detect infected blood cells. This process is expensive, and results depend both on the quality of smear and on the expertise of the microscopist. Thus, work done in this field is focussed on automating this detection of infected cells. Early work for this task included using hand-engineered features and machine learning algorithms. This approach was taken over by the advent of CNNs which provided an end-to-end solution, right from feature extraction to classification. Work done in this field thus shifted towards using state-of-the-art CNNs. The authors of this paper found that most of the existing models that had been used for this problem had good classification accuracy but had big sizes that could not be run on a normal computing device. They identified that a new set of state-of-the-art CNNs, called EfficientNets which promised similar performance at much smaller sizes, had not been used for this task. So, they worked to evaluate the performance of EfficientNet models for this medical image classification task. The authors trained the EfficientNet-B0 model on the malaria images dataset taken from the National Library of Medicine (NLM) (Dataset used: https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/LHC-publications/pubs/MalariaDatasets.html ). The authors then computed the key performance parameters of the model and compared them against the existing models for this problem. The work done showed that using Efficient-Net models for this task achieved similar accuracy to existing models and significantly reduced the number of parameters.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Information Storage and Retrieval']"

The use of fuzzy logic is an urgent direction in cases of incomplete certainty when making a medical diagnosis. Human health depends on making the right decision, as it can be difficult for a doctor to choose the correct diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia. To develop a medical expert system, we considered scales and algorithms for assessing the prognosis of the severity of community-acquired pneumonia PORT (PSI), CURB/CRB-65 and SMART-COP/SMART-CO. We strive to contribute the results of our research to the development of medical software products, namely, to increase the efficiency of medical services using artificial intelligence.

Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) aims to represent entities and relations into low-dimensional vector spaces and has gained extensive attention. However, recent studies show that KGEs can be easily misled by slight perturbation, such as adding or deleting one knowledge fact on the training data, also called adversarial attack. In this paper, we propose an adversarial defense mechanism against attacks on KGE for the first time. Two stages are designed for defense, including offline stage and online stage . Given a manipulated knowledge graph, the former develops a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework to assist the training of KGE against attack, namely, adversarial training. The latter combines a sub-graph generation method with link prediction as preprocessing strategies to detect perturbations, namely, perturbation detection. The combination of two stages makes it perform well against adding attacks by filtering possible perturbations using perturbation detection before adversarial training. The experimental results demonstrate our method has better performance in defending the state-of-the-art attacks.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Security Science and Technology']"

The gradual thinning of cornea induces the loss of elasticity results into a cone-shaped protrusion. This may irreversibly change the cornea and could cause the loss of vision. In spite of many researches have been pursued over a decade, it remains difficult to detect keratoconus accurately in its early stage. Apart from being an important prerequisite for refractive surgery, identification of corneal steepening shape helps to choose the right treatment and determines the progression of the keratoconus. The different shapes of steepening are extracted from the given corneal topographies herein. In this study, we have applied, pretrained deep learning models using transfer learning approach to classify the corneal topography patterns from corneal eroded images derived from the corneal images. The said models are used to classify corneal eroded images into ten labels as per patterns prevailed in corneal curvature due to the steepening of the surface.

It was confirmed that the longer the number of likes (counts) added to the active expression of music consumers, which is fandom, the longer the life cycle of the soundtrack lasted.

It is of great importance to this field to design detection algorithms that have the capability of learning from security data to be able to hunt threats, achieve better monitoring, master the complexity of the threat intelligence feeds, and achieve timely remediation of security incidents.

Nowadays, deep learning has been widely used in various medical applications. Deep learning-based AI systems require a large amount of training data for model learning. However, acquiring sufficient training data with high-quality annotation is a major challenge in Healthcare. As a result, deep learning-based models face a lack of annotated training data problem. While the generalization of a label-rich training domain (source) to a new test domain (target) causes a domain shift problem in deep learning-based models. To solve the lack of training data and domain shift problem, domain adaptation-based methods have recently been developed as a technique to bridge the domain gap across datasets with different feature characteristics and data distributions. In this chapter, we have proposed domain adaptation-based technique for liver tumor detection in multi-phase CT images. We discuss the domain-shift problem in different phases of multiphase liver CT images and introduce our domain adaptation technique for multi-phase CT images. We have used PV phase images to learn a model and applied the learnt model to ART and NC phase images (i.e. different domains) by adapting the domain knowledge. To address the domain gap between the different phases of CT images, we employ adversarial learning scheme using an anchor-free object detector. Further, we propose to use the maximum square loss for mid-level output feature maps to improve the performance. Our method does not require separate object-level annotations for each phase of Multiphase CT image while training.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-11371-0_9,en,Solutions of Brand Posts on Facebook to Increase Customer Engagement Using the Random Forest Prediction Model,OriginalPaper,"This paper aims to predict customer engagement behaviour (CEB), i.e. likes, shares, comments, and emoji reactions, on company posts on Facebook. A sample of 1109 brand posts from Facebook pages in Lithuania was used. The Random Forest method was used to train models to predict customer engagement behaviour based on features including time frame, content, and media types of brand posts. The data was used for training nine binary classification models using the Random Forest method, which can predict the popularity of a company’s posts. In terms of social score, accuracy of likes, comments, and shares varied from 68.4% (likes on a post) to 84.0% (comments on a post). For emotional responses, accuracy varied from 65.6% (‘wow’ on a post) to 82.5% (‘ha ha’ on a post). The data was collected from one single media platform and country, and encompassed emotional expressions at an early stage on Facebook. The findings of Random Forest prediction models can help organisations to make more efficient solutions for brand posts on Facebook to increase customer engagement. This paper outlines the first steps in creating a predictive engagement score towards diverse types of brand posts on Facebook. The same approach to features of brand posts might be applied to other social media platforms such as Instagram and LinkedIn.","['Business and Management', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Environmental Policy', 'Corporate Environmental Management', 'Environmental Management']"

Modulation classification as a specific topic in AMC applies Deep Learning (DL) in this work, which contributes a creative way to analyse the signal transmitted in low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). We describe a dynamic system for the Millimeter wave (mmW) bands in our work. The signals collected from the receiving system is without phase lock or frequency lock. DL is applied to our system to classify the modulation types within a wide range of SNR. In this system, we provided a method named Graphic Representation of Features (GRF) in order to present the statistical features in a spider graph for DL. The RF modulation is generated by a lab signal generator, sent through antennas and then captured by an RF signal analyser. In the results from the system with the GRF techniques we find an overall classification accuracy of 56% for 0 dB SNR and 67% at 10 dB SNR. Meanwhile the accuracy of a random guess with no classifiers applied is only 25%. The results of the system at 28 GHz are also compared to our previous work at 2 GHz.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The more complex the architecture, the slower the speed. This time, we implemented a Single Shot Multibox Detector(SSD) using GPU with CUDA. We have improved the object detection speed of SSD, which is one of the most regularly used objects detection frameworks. The most time-consuming part, the VGG16 network, is rewritten by using cuDNN, which is made faster by about 9%. The second time-consuming part is post-processing, where non-maximum-suppression (NMS) is performed. We accelerated NMS by implementing our new algorithms that are suitable for GPUs, which is about 52% faster than the original PyTorch version [ 16 ]. We also ported those parts that were originally executed on CPU to GPU. In total, our GPU-accelerated SSD can detect objects 22.5% faster than the original version. We demonstrate that using GPUs to accelerate existing frameworks is a viable approach.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

As RL agents further integrate with our society, they must learn to comply with ethical, social, or legal norms. Defeasible deontic logics are natural formal frameworks to specify and reason about such norms in a transparent way. However, their effective and efficient integration in RL agents remains an open problem. On the other hand, linear temporal logic (LTL) has been successfully employed to synthesize RL policies satisfying, e.g., safety requirements. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which the established machinery for safe reinforcement learning can be leveraged for directing normative behaviour for RL agents. We analyze some of the difficulties that arise from attempting to represent norms with LTL, provide an algorithm for synthesizing LTL specifications from certain normative systems, and analyze its power and limits with a case study.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The only possible escape from this pandemic is wearing a mask. Mask checks are being done in most public places. This project brings out a good technique for recognizing a mask on a face. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction method which is used in image and signal processing. It uses only the principal components of a dataset and ignores rest of the components. In this paper, three different pre-processing methods (modular, wavelet and a combination of both) have been performed on an image dataset. The resultant data has been processed through PCA. Through comparison of the processed data vectors, the similarity between images has been established. Also, a comparison between different PCA techniques is developed through recognition of distorted faces. Initially, a comparison between different PCA techniques is developed through recognition of distorted faces. Then, a comparison is done between the Modular PCA, Wavelet PCA and Modular-Wavelet PCA techniques by observing the performance for mask recognition. Finally, a conclusion is drawn as to which method is the best in terms of mask recognition.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Information Storage and Retrieval']"

To estimate the severity of this disease, physicians need to type, among other things, the extent of the disease on images that are often of poor quality. The extent of ROP is measured from the optical disc. Therefore, it is essential to have an automatic method that locates and segments the optical disc. In order to contribute to a computational method that detects the optic disc in children’s pathological images, a fast-processing method is presented in this work. This method creates a template-based local binary pattern histogram. Next, the method proposes recognizing candidate windows as an optical disk from regional maxima. Then, the template is used to choose the correct optic disk. This method used thirty images from the ROPFI dataset that contains infant pathological images. The optic disk has been manually labeled.

According to American Cancer Society, vast number of new cancer cases are predicted which are increasing every year. So, the early detection of brain tumor may decline the death percentage, and it would be helpful for the cancer specialist to cure the patients in primary stage. Image processing concepts are applied for the detection of normal and malignant brain scans using computer-aided tools. A new framework has been proposed to detect the brain tumor using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modality. The steps of the implementation of proposed framework are (a) image collection, (b) preprocessing, (c) segmentation, (d) statistical feature extraction, and (e) dual classification. Fuzzy K-mean segmentation is executed followed by statistical feature extraction in terms of texture. After that, dual classification is performed consequently one after another, i.e., autoencoder deep neural network followed by binary SVM. The primarily training has been completed by autoencoder, and the resultant of this is again trained by SVM. Finally, testing has been accomplished by SVM only. The performance of the proposed framework has been assessed with Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge dataset (BraTS 2013) in terms of sensitivity, specificity, AUC-ROC, and accuracy. The performance of the proposed framework is remarkable, and the accuracy of autoencoder + SVM achieved by this framework is 96.4% as compared to SVM alone.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Information Storage and Retrieval']"

Dark Web pages can be accessed from private networks such as TOR (The Onion Routing), I2P (Invisible Internet Project) and Freenet. TOR is widely used by the Dark Web users in a domain defined by a .onion extension. Dark Web users can communicate with each other without using their identification. However, the anonymity of these users encourages them to perform illegal activities. This requires an immediate identification of imminent criminal threats and mitigation via algorithms, techniques and tools used to protect everyone from attacks inside the Dark Web. The aim is to make timely and pre-emptive detection of Dark Web threats before the Dark Web actor(s) can put their threats into action. The accuracy of the attacks on TOR network and the use of IoT and streaming technologies require agile algorithms to monitor the forums and to limit attacks. The methodology begins with a literature review, gap analysis and a research design using quantitative research methods such as comparative analysis of Dark Web forum datasets using data science techniques and an experimental research design involving machine learning and strategies for training and development of a model. After the gap analysis of the previous research methods, it is possible to try to extend or modify these algorithms or the applied techniques to see if those gaps can be closed. The findings and conclusion to this hybrid experimental research methodology will lead to a proposal on mitigating risks via a model for real-time detection, evaluation and response.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Security Science and Technology']"

Barrier-free bus stops refer to stops without obstacles, like flowerbeds and trash cans, to ensure the disabled, the elderly, etc., are comfortable getting on and off the bus. These stops may also have additional support facilities such as enhanced sidewalk block maintenance, braille block reinforcement, and low-floor bus location indications. However, the transportation environment for those in need is still not improving. Of the buses operating in Seoul, only 47.3% are low-floor buses designed for wheelchairs, and there are not enough barrier-free bus stops. In addition, notwithstanding the recent protests regarding the right to travel for the disabled. However, barrier-free bus stops have not increased, and the right to travel is not guaranteed. According to the Nodeul Independent Living Center for the Disabled, after monitoring mobility in Jongno-gu since 2019, it was found that the accessibility for wheelchairs and blind route information in Jongno-gu was minimal. Jongno-gu is an essential stopover for bus routes and is the core of Seoul’s transportation system, with a floating population of more than two million. Thus, the lack of accessible transportation is an issue. This study address these problems, by proposing installation locations of barrier-free bus stops by using cluster analysis. The analysis was conducted using information on ‘convenience facilities with provisions for the disabled’ (ease of use for the disabled), ‘institutional transportation facilities for the vulnerable’ (welfare facilities), and ‘the population getting on and off of transportation’ (accessibility of transportation). This study used convenience, welfare, and transportation accessibility to determine stops.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

After extensive data analysis, it is concluded that features like “FUEL CONSUMPTION CITY”, “FUEL CONSUMPTION HWY”, and “VEHICLE CLASS” have a direct effect on CO 2 emissions. As the fuel consumption on the highway and in the city increases or the vehicle size increases, CO 2 emissions will also increase. On the other hand, a feature like COMB, basically the economy of the car, is inversely proportional to CO 2 emissions, i.e., better the economy, lower the CO 2 emissions. Thus, the focus should be given to increase the economy of the vehicle which will help to achieve the net-zero emissions target. The two superior models, namely the random forest regressor and XGBoost regressor, can accurately predict the carbon emissions of any kind of vehicle that run on fossil fuels. These models can be used to predict carbon emissions caused by vehicles in metropolitan cities, which in turn can help the local governing bodies in regulating the rules and public transport systems, leading to a reduction in CO 2 emissions. In future, the current dataset, which is mainly about light motor vehicles, can be extended to include the data for other types of vehicles. The combined dataset can be used to create better insights regarding the CO 2 emissions and the type of vehicle responsible for it, and hence help make necessary changes or modifications in the manufacturing of those vehicles as well as policy formulation..","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Sustainable Development', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Machine Learning']"

Not only it is useful to automate certain kinds of jobs to improve efficiency, but also it also takes away the scope of human errors that are ever-present within such fields. A multitude of factors like differences in skills, experience, and more critically, basic human errors contributes to inadequacy and thereby inefficiency. These are not merely hypotheticals, but legitimate concerns raised in research papers and by professionals within their respective sectors as laid out in (Hopfer et al. in Histopathology 78:358–370, 2021 [ 1 ]). Yet, no significant work has been done so far in combining object detection with the identification of the coronavirus. This is due to some significant obstacles. Recognizing these viruses is a tedious task because substantial datasets of electron microscope images are not available. In this paper, we propose a method of detecting the virus through electron microscope imagery using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) convolutional neural network (CNN) model. We trained our model on an amalgamation of two datasets. The first is an open-access dataset named ‘electron microscopy of SARS-CoV particles Dataset’ by Laue, Michael; Kauter, Anne; Hoffmann, Tobias; Michel, Janine; Nitsche, Andreas. The second is ‘The SARS-CoV-2 Dataset’ by Northeastern University, made available to us on request by Prof. Jiawei Zhang. Overall, we achieved a mean average precision of 86.5%. Such a system is beneficial as it assists in a large amount of research work, both in terms of increasing efficiency and minimizing errors. However, we do believe there exists a lot of scope to build upon the work with a larger dataset in order to achieve higher accuracy.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Information Storage and Retrieval']"

doi:10.1007/978-981-19-2535-1_45,en,An Empirical Analysis of Fixed and Fuzzy-Based Traffic Congestion Control System,OriginalPaper,"Traffic Management in an optimum way seems to be an effective way to reduce traffic congestion over various intersections. The core idea behind this optimality is to provide green time for dynamic traffic flow changes in urban areas. As the vehicles are waiting in the queue during red light time, an effective control system is required to reduce the waiting time. In a fixed time/conventional traffic system green light is turned on for a fixed time in each direction. Such systems are generally pre-programmed or the fixed delay in each direction can be controlled manually and hence requires a human operator to make the desired changes, as and when required. Also, a human operator will change this for a limited number of times in a day. However, this process can be automated by using fuzzy control systems. In the fuzzy controlled traffic systems, the on time of green light is adjusted (during each transition of traffic lights) depending on the different input parameters such as Queue length, Time of the day, Arrival Rate and Waiting Time, etc. Adjustment in number of transitions indicates the flexibility/adaptive nature of fuzzy controlled system. In this paper, the novelty in the field of traffic engineering is introduced by computing the relative significance of identified parameters. Various fuzzy models with three input parameters, i.e., Arrival rate, Queue length and Waiting Time are implemented and comparative performance analysis of the seven fuzzy models hence obtained, is presented. The performance of all the implemented fuzzy models is also compared with the conventional traffic system. A traffic simulator is implemented in MATLAB to generate the real-time traffic conditions, each system is simulated and compared for all possible combinations of traffic density. Fuzzy model with two input parameters Queue length and Waiting Time outperforms the other systems and provides 23.69% average improvement in the delay observed by the vehicles waiting in the queue.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Section 4.1 describes the current state of AI implementations. Therefore, an international management report shows that most of the companies that have invested in AI did not get any impact from it up to now. Another aspect is that difficulties in generating value from AI are organizational and not technologically based. Another literature research outcome shows that companies with a clear AI focus on data and technology are gaining less value than those who actively align AI owners, process owners, and business owners. Also, companies with an AI IT focus generate less value than those with a broad strategic focus. Section 4.2 goes deeper into business strategy. It describes that an increasing number of managers see AI not only as an opportunity, but they also define it as a strategic risk, which has been increasing over the last years. The two important strategic approaches are integrating AI with strategic digital initiatives and the AI focus on revenue generation instead of cost reduction. For the future, management needs to focus on human resource and talent strategy to ensure the development of AI systems. Section 4.3 gives an overview of some C-level statements about their AI implementation experience and status.","['Business and Management', 'IT in Business', 'Business Ethics', 'Engineering Ethics', 'Organization', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

However, there is a limited study of adverse events (AEs) for COVID-19 vaccines among people with type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study is to report the common adverse events following the COVID-19 vaccines, mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, and JNJ-78436735 in diabetic patients. We collected data for common adverse events to the COVID-19 vaccines using Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). To identify the people with and without diabetes, we used the Natural language processing algorithms. After a 1:3 propensity score matching, we used 6,829 people with type 2 diabetes and 20,487 healthy control groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to obtain the odds ratio for 25 common AEs in order of high frequency. The most common AEs were pain (17.9%), headache (16.6%), pyrexia (13.4%), chills (12.4%), fatigue (12.0%), dizziness (11.0%). In particular, AEs of the dysmenorrhea in women were rare (0.14%), but a 15-fold higher frequency was observed in patients with diabetes (0.45% versus 0.03%) than in those with controls. The risk of all common AEs following both mRNA vaccines was significantly lower (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.77–0.97, P = 0.015) than that after one viral vector vaccine, as well as the risk among males (OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.53–0.59, P < 0.001) was lower than among females. In conclusion, the risk of common adverse events among people with type 2 diabetes was low after both mRNA vaccines and in males. These findings might have implications for safe vaccine use.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Several previous approaches deorder plans to annotate and find partial orderings. However, these methods do not fully support conditional effects. Conditional effects provide an expressive and convenient way to model complex and intricate scenarios allowing a single action to have context-dependent effects. In comparison with other features of ADL, conditional effects are surprisingly tricky to handle. In this paper, We develop a new algorithm for plan deordering that supports conditional effects. The algorithm also preserves the essence of conditional effects while deordering so that the generated partial orderings can be further used or modified. Our algorithm can successfully deorder plans from the domains of international planning competitions.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The COVID-19 virus spreads mostly through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it is important to practice respiratory etiquette. The COVID-19 is spreading our community in a faster manner, stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, and cleaning hands. The appropriate use of wearing a mask is a normal part of our life. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been emerging and circulating around the world throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. To minimize the risk of transmissions, the use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings. Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus. Masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the disease. In this paper, novel face mask detection on masked face data set is done by using pretrained Xception, deep learning with depth wise separable convolution. The proposed method classifies from the given face image, mask is worn or not. The proposed method is tested and validated using the face mask data set obtained from Kaggle. This data set contains about 503 face images with mask and 503 images without mask. The experimental results show that the proposed face mask detection method significantly dominates other compared pretrained models. The results of the receiver operating characteristic curve and area under curve justify the relevance of the better results in favor of the proposed method.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Statistics, general', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

Retrieval of relevant data has become a very tedious job. The novelty of this paper is that we are providing a holistic approach to retrieve information or abstracts from a corpus of published papers and artifacts, by improving the conventional methods of searching abstracts. To get a better search result, reviewer can provide phrases, sentences and even a complete abstract. This brings to the reviewer the most relevant abstracts in any huge database of publications. To accomplish this, we have implemented topic modelling based semantic search. Various AI algorithms are used to find the closest and nearest abstracts to any given search abstract. For this paper we have extensively used the PUBMED data. Along with search abstracts we are also providing other inherent features which may get unnoticed in huge corpus, like similar words, relation between words and phrases.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Statistics, general', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Storage Representation', 'Data Structures and Information Theory']"

Hence, all variations in the weather have an impact on the agriculture as well as on the economy of the country. India being a farmer’s-dependent economy indirectly depends on good rainfall. India gets a yearly precipitation of roughly 4000 billion cubic meter (BCM) which include snowfall, with an average rainfall of about 1170 mm. In the current times, climate change is a matter of major concern. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and point spread function (PSF) were used. But traditional methods have some limitations, are expensive and require large data set. Predictions are created by mathematical model defined by a set of equations that predict future rainfall with the help of a dynamical strategy. The paper performs a comparison between multiple linear regression (MLR), K-nearest neighbour (KNN), backpropagation with ANN and long short-term memory (LSTM) on the prediction of rainfall. Statistical methods are performed such as MAE, RMSE, MSE to compare the different prediction model and to choose the best suitable one. The test cases provided a lower MAE, RMSE and MSE value in case of LSTM model as it can memorize how elements in a series are ordered in a time series data. Instead of having the information which was before and unchangeable, LSTMs have the capacity to identify the context necessary to make forecasts in time series forecasting scenario.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Statistics, general', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

As a mechanism for changing or forming one’s opinion or behavior, persuasive dialogues and their strategies have gained interest for developing intelligent conversational systems. Given the complexity of this task, persuasion systems, especially dealing in conversations that require ‘no action’ by the user but rather a change in opinion or belief, require specialized annotated corpora and the understanding of logical structure, natural language, and persuasive strategies. The sparsity of available annotated data and a wide range of proposed models make it challenging for developing strategic chatbots specific to user needs. To address these issues, this study introduces a novel framework combining a replicable data collection tool and a topic-independent annotation schema for designing an argument-graph corpus and incorporating both persuader and persuadee perspectives, essential for building smart conversational agents.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Hence this study proposed investigating the capability of six deep learning models, namely the AlexNet, GoogleNet, ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101 and InceptionV3, in determining the most optimum model for snatch theft detection. Two categories of databases comprising 13000 images of snatch theft and non-snatch activities were generated from 120 videos obtained from the Google and YouTube platforms. These images are further used for training and testing these six DL models, along with data augmentation implemented during training to avoid overfitting. However, it was found that overfitting occurred based on training and testing accuracy plots, and hence, it was decided to re-train the model using an early stopping method. Thus, upon completion of re-training all six models, it was found that all six models showed a good-fit condition, with ResNet 50 attaining the highest testing accuracy of 98.9% and 100% sensitivity. As for specificity, ResNet 101 showed the highest value, precisely 97.7%.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

To detect COVID-19, we suggested an Ensemble deep learning method with an attention mechanism. The suggested approach uses an ensemble of RNN and CNN to extract features from data from diverse sources, such as CT scan pictures and blood test results. For image and video processing, CNNs are the most effective. RNNs, on the other hand, use text and speech data to extract features. Further, an attention mechanism is used to determine which features are most relevant for classification. Finally, the deep learning network utilizes the selected features for detection and prediction.

To extract characteristics from text-based pictures, morphological component analysis is utilised. Each of these traits has a distinct morphological component. Without losing visual quality, the morphological component technique lowers duplicative but also uncorrelated characteristics, as well as the size in bytes of a text-based picture. The capacity to obtain full text-based picture texture characteristics, rather than relying on a single spatial texture feature, is considered to be a significant aspect of the proposed approach. Before being transferred over Internet of Things-based networks, the morphological portions of a concealed text-based picture have been further divided and generally implanted interested in the least significant pieces of the cover pixels using spatial steganography. To retrieve the message from stored-images, the hidden key of an embedding algorithm can be exchanged with a text recovery approach on the recipient's side.

Many medical imaging modalities have proven to effectively diagnose these diseases and their progression in a noninvasive way. Out of all the available modalities, ultrasound is the preferred mode of examination for imaging soft tissue organs for disease prediction because of its ease of use, low cost, portability, and lack of ionizing radiation. The radiologists manually study these scans for making an accurate diagnosis of the underlying condition. However, ultrasound imaging is highly operator-dependent and its effectiveness is adversely affected because of the presence of speckle noise. Therefore, to overcome these issues and for an efficient disease diagnosis, different computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems have been developed by researchers using artificial intelligence techniques along with the metrological characteristics of the diseased part as visible on the ultrasound scan of the organ under study. The main purpose of the present chapter is to shed light on the different types of diseases that affect the soft tissue organs like kidney, liver, thyroid, breast and their sonographic appearances, and characteristics. The chapter further describes methodologies developed in recent existing literature (year 2017 onwards) for the classification of diseases using ultrasound images of these organs through a CAD system using state-of-the-art deep learning and machine learning methods. The chapter also gives an insight into designing an efficient CAD system for the classification of breast tumors. The authors in the chapter have used nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) for multiresolution analysis of the original tumor images. From the subimages obtained using NSCT, extraction of texture features has been carried out using gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), whereas shape features have been computed from the preprocessed tumor images. The computed feature set (texture + shape) has been used for classifying breast tumors using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy classifier with linguistic hedges (ANFC-LH) classifier based on the optimal features selected on the basis of the hedge values associated with the fuzzy rules.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Nanotechnology']"

Western culture has significantly challenged Chinese traditional culture and social norms, which have been dominated by men. Influenced by Western feminism, Chinese feminists fought to emancipate women and greatly improved Chinese women’s social status during the twentieth century. However, in the twenty-first century, witnessing the problems of previous feminist movements, which any human endeavors could not avoid, the globalized patriarchal world does not wait for feminists to find a solution but have a strong backlash against feminism. In China, misaligned with the rapid economic development, Chinese women’s rights have significantly rolled back to serve men’s interests in the twenty-first century. The double portion of the cultural constraints from both traditional Chinese and modern Western cultures provide Chinese women with both greater challenges and greater opportunities. On one hand, a Chinese woman should not make herself a bigger foot-binding cloth in her mind by internalizing the intersectionality of globalized patriarchal cultures; on the other hand, she should not follow the misleading information from the mass media to be manipulated as woman tools to make great leaps to serve patriarchal and capitalist interests. Surviving and succeeding in the double portion of the cultural constraints of a globalized world, Chinese women leaders have developed a double portion of wisdom from both traditional Chinese and modern Western cultures. If Western women leaders are like iron ladies with assertiveness, Chinese women leaders are more like water ladies with gentleness, flexibility, and fortitude. The hard iron could be broken by harder cultural constraints. Dripping water hollows out stone ( di shui chuan shi ) through persistence instead of force. This chapter utilizes a transdisciplinary approach to examine both the cultural constraints and opportunities for Chinese women from both traditional and modern cultures through historical and global lenses.

Unfortunately, current methods require too much user involvement and fail to capture their true preferences. In fact, to avoid the nuisance of manually setting preferences, users usually accept the default settings even if these do not conform to their true preferences. Norms can be useful to regulate behaviour and ensure it adheres to user preferences but, while the literature has thoroughly studied norms, most proposals take a formal perspective. Indeed, while there has been some research on constructing norms to capture a user’s privacy preferences, these methods rely on domain knowledge which, in the case of AI technologies, is difficult to obtain and maintain. We argue that a new perspective is required when constructing norms, which is to exploit the large amount of preference information readily available from whole systems of users.

Using time-series cross-sectional data and depending on the pooled data model and random effects, the results of this study showed strong evidence that other operating income and net interest income have a positive and statistically significant impact on profitability in Jordanian commercial banks, while other operating expenses have a negative and significant impact on profitability. For the bank value model, other operating expenses has a negative effect, but it is weak statistically significant, while the net interest income has a positive effect and statistical significance. The net interest income in the two models, whether profitability or value, achieved the highest coefficient and the largest statistically significant effect. Bank size plays a positive and always statistically significant role in the profitability and value of banks. For the inflation and growth variables, they do not have any statistically significant effect, except for inflation which has a weak, statistically significant and positive effect on the profitability model. The study recommends that the managers of Jordanian commercial banks attempt to reduce other operating expenses because of their negative impact on the profitability and value of the bank.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Business Information Systems']"

This paper investigates the moderating effect of gender on the actual use of technology and other determents believed to be critical factors influencing the usage. These factors are compiled under three theoretical frameworks, namely, technology acceptance, unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, and diffusion innovation theory. Technology acceptance compiled two factors: perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. While unified theory of acceptance and use of technology consists of the moderate factor gender. Likewise, the diffusion innovation theory consists of the system's technological features, such as the complexity used in this paper. The overall results of this paper are based on previous scholars’ findings and results from different technology acceptance and usage contexts. Researchers indicate that even with the mixed results presented by previous literature, research assumes that gender behavioral patterns toward remote working differ based on the time of risks and crises such as coronavirus and the time period.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Business Information Systems']"

With the disruption of Bitcoin as a new model which relies on decentralisation and anonymity, attackers have taken advantage of this monetary system. It allows them to obtain funds from illegal activities such as ransomware payments and hide them. At the same time, Law Enforcement Agencies use open-source data to apply network forensics to Blockchain data. The analysis is usually performed by using artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, the current situation shows a scarcity of high-quality data sets to train the detection algorithms. This work tries to overcome this barrier with significant contributions. With nearly 25,000 illicit transactions, we have increased the Elliptic Data Set –the most extensive labelled transaction data publicly available in any cryptocurrency. The former data set only contained 4,545 illicit transactions, resulting in a class imbalance of 9.8:90.2 illicit/licit ratio. Our work has changed that to a 41.2:58.8 illicit/licit ratio. Besides, to show that class imbalance datasets can also be beaten with artificial work, we have studied the use of generative adversarial networks (GAN) for creating synthetic samples. Finally, the last part of this work was dedicated to applying deep learning and, more particularly, long short-term memory networks (LSTM) for the binary classification problem.

Before the classification process, bioinformatics analysis was performed using the QIIME2–2021.4 tool which resulted in profiling microbiome communities present in host organisms. Alpha diversity metrics were calculated using three different indexes (Shannon’s diversity index, Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity, and Observed OTUs) while Kruskal–Wallis test was used to confirm significant difference (p-value < 0.05) between study groups. To achieve binary classification, the dataset was divided into three subsets each containing two groups (AD vs aMCI, AD vs HC, aMCI vs HC) Prior to the classification process, SelectKBest with the f_classif algorithm was used as univariate feature selection to reduce the number of features in each group to top five. 5-fold cross-validation yielded high accuracy results (going over 70%) for a number of classifiers, with the highest accuracy reach of 78.3% (via Logistic Regression) in the case of distinguishing between aMCI and HC subjects.

This paper presents the development of an early drowning detection system based on the Bluetooth Low Energy technology and the received signal strength-based localization method that allows lifeguards to monitor the position of swimmers in real time. Swimmers wearing Bluetooth tags are monitored by four Bluetooth beacon scanners installed in the swimming area. The wearable Bluetooth tags periodically send beacon signals to the Bluetooth beacon scanners. Locations of swimmers are estimated using an improved RSSI-based algorithm. The radio links between Bluetooth tag and beacon scanners will be interrupted when the victim is submerged under water for certain duration. Sirens placed in the monitored area are then triggered to alert lifeguards about drowning accident. The proposed system helps to narrow down the search area and reduce the rescue time when drowning occurs.,"['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

Detection of melanocytes from histopathological image is difficult because melanocytes are very much similar to the keratinocytes. To detect melanoma cells at first, segmentation is required followed by calculation of perimeter of the cells. If it is greater than the threshold value, then it is identified as melanoma cells. K-means clustering unsupervised learning technique is used to segment the image followed by ellipse fitting algorithm to find out abnormally large cells. The centroid is then calculated and marked as nuclei. Experiment is performed on 30 images and is evaluated based on PPV, sensitivity, and NSR. The proposed work achieved 90% PPV, 85% sensitivity, and 13% SNR value.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Information Storage and Retrieval']"

As the geriatric population progresses, the need for novel solutions to manage age-related diseases increases. To combat this, intensive rehabilitation treatment is instituted repetitively. However, the traditional rehabilitation treatment regimes, involving tedious and monotonous activity with numerous repetitions, lacking active patient participation are of boring and strenuous nature. This ultimately leads to suboptimal treatment outcomes necessitating long-term care. To overcome this, a range of interactive and easy measuring technology-based innovative solutions fused with the rehabilitation process is being investigated to ameliorate the effectiveness and productivity of rehabilitation programs and escalate the independence of patients and empower them to administer their treatment. Recently, game-based Virtual Reality (VR) rehabilitation protocol has turned out to be a promising therapeutic alternative, amalgamating Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) with VR to activate neuro-motor functions, sustain motivation and reach rehabilitation goals to improve the quality of life of patients. Virtual rehabilitation is a computer-generated interactive patient-centred simulation system combining computers, special interfaces, and simulation exercises that imitates reality and provides an artificial environment mimicking real-world experience. The architecture of the system is designed in such a way that it can remotely track the patients, obtain data, and tailor the rehabilitation sessions according to the current needs of the patients. VR improves both motor skills and confidence for daily living and in numerous situations to enhance functional results, improving the clinical and social benefits of surgery. Thus, game-based VR is being developed to allow clinicians to create game-based VR tasks and this will serve to drive advances in rehabilitation interventions.","['Computer Science', 'Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common type of arrhythmia that can be diagnosed using an electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern. Identification of arrhythmia through ECG can be very challenging because the process is highly dependent on experts and very time consuming. The use of deep learning in automatically assisting the detection of arrhythmia using one-dimensional (1-D) input is proposed in this study. Deep learning is preferred over standard neural networks because it facilitates training in an end-to-end manner and directly trains the classification system with raw signals. This study aims to investigate the performance of 1-D convolutional neural network (CNN) for arrhythmia classification and improve its performance by introducing a hybrid approach based on long short-term memory (LSTM) approach. Experimental data are obtained from PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2017 database. ECG signals are preprocessed via filtering, QRS detection, segmentation and median wave selection. One-dimensional CNN, hybrid CNN–long short-term memory (CNN–LSTM) and hybrid CNN–bidirectional LSTM (CNN–biLSTM) models are developed and evaluated in this study to classify ECG signals into (1) normal rhythm, (2) AF rhythm, (3) other rhythms and (4) noisy signal. Accuracies of the 1-D CNN, hybrid CNN–LSTM and 1-D hybrid CNN–biLSTM models were 91.67%, 82.33% and 94.67%, respectively. The experimental results showed that the proposed CNN models can aid in atrial fibrillation (AF) diagnosis for healthcare advancement.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Health Informatics']"

Semantic learning of classifiers involves the knowledge of edge-labels, which is a complex problem in image processing. Here we examine several levels of information in order to adopt a feasible method where all edges required pixels for the continuous detection of the objects. In this paper, we study the application of object detection and several recent approaches developed using boundary information in past decades.

We can employ it to inform decision making processes based on ethical considerations, as a measure to ensure redundancy that helps us in avoiding system failure, as well as for verifying that autonomous systems remain trustworthy by testing for unwanted responsibility voids in advance. We follow recent proposals to use probabilities as the basis for responsibility ascription in uncertain environments rather than the deterministic causal views employed in much of the previous formal philosophical literature. Using an axiomatic approach we formally evaluate the qualities of (classes of) proposed responsibility functions. To this end, we decompose the computation of the responsibility a group carries for an outcome into the computation of values that we assign to its members for individual decisions leading to that outcome, paired with an appropriate aggregation function. Next, we discuss a number of intuitively desirable properties for each of these contributing functions. We find an incompatibility between axioms determining upper and lower bounds for the values assigned at the member level. Regarding the aggregation from member-level values to group-level responsibility we are able to axiomatically characterise one promising aggregation function. Finally, we present two maximally axiom compliant group-level responsibility measures – one respecting the lower bound axioms at the member level and one respecting the corresponding upper bound axioms.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

However, the size of domestic donations has been in decline since its peak in 2013. Transparency and reliability are important for donation organizations’ selection criteria, and the most necessary thing to spread the donation culture is to strengthen the transparency of fundraising organizations. Blockchain technology is well known for Bitcoin, but its true value comes from that fact that it can secure transparency and reliability at low cost. In addition, it is a technology that has an advantage in strengthening security, and has recently attracted attention in many industries. Blockchain technology is a key platform in the new era that can dramatically reduce transaction costs and ensure transparency in institutions and donations of non-profit organizations required by sponsors or those who want to sponsor. It is a technology optimized for NGOs that have to operate under IT operating costs and security at a low cost. Because blockchain technology is superior in transparency and security, companies are starting to systematically research and apply it.

An airbag is one of the passive safety systems available in an automobile. However, the airbag deployment needs to be controlled to avoid accidents due to it. In low-velocity crashes, the injury caused by airbag deployment is higher than the impact inside the vehicle. Children are more vulnerable to airbags when they sit near airbag housing without proper seatbelts or child seat arrangements. Deployment of the airbag when no occupant is sitting on a seat is unnecessary. So, it is important to detect the occupants’ presence in a seat and their classes such as a child or an adult. The primary aim of the paper is to detect the occupants’ presence and classify them into different classes. The occupant classes used are child and adult. In this project, we developed a technique to identify the occupants’ presence and verify the data from one sensor using another. We collected the image data of the occupants using a camera in a sedan and hatchback vehicles. We analyzed the images using a deep learning algorithm. The output classified the occupants as child and adult. A load cell sensor mounted on the seat was used to measure the weight of the passenger.

The onset of cataract is slow and is therefore not detected until it starts to obstruct the vision of the affected patient. One way to detect cataract is through study of the ocular fundus images. Machine learning techniques trained on available datasets offer effective and fast methods of detecting abnormalities in ocular fundus and can be used for identifying patients affected by cataract. In this paper, we trained and tested various machine learning techniques in order to perform binary classification for cataract detection on ocular fundus images. We implemented techniques such as support vector machines, random forest, decision tree, logistic regression, naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, XGBoost, light gradient boosting, and voting classifier. Improved results were obtained through light gradient boosting.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Rashomon effect has been named the phenomenon of receiving different machine learning (ML) explanations when employing different models to describe the same data. On the basis of concrete examples, cases of Rashomon effect will be visually demonstrated and discussed to underline the difficulty to practically produce definite and unambiguous machine learning explanations and predictions. Artificial intelligence (AI) presently undergoes a so-called replication and reproducibility crisis which hinders models and techniques from being properly assessed for robustness, fairness, and safety. Studying the Rashomon effect is important for understanding the causes of the unintended variability of results which originate from-* within the models and the XAI methods themselves.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Despite the dramatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, there is a rising trend of people refusing to be vaccinated. As a result, governments and health experts must gather and understand public ideas and perceptions about vaccines to design engagement and education efforts about vaccine advantages. Sentiment analysis is a common method for acquiring a broad picture of public opinion, that enables the classification of people as those who are in favor or against vaccination, as well as the determination of the factors that influence their attitudes and beliefs. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the general approach to sentiment analysis in the context of vaccinations and review its different use cases. The chapter’s experimental component integrates the utilization of a dataset retrieved from Kaggle, which contains COVID-19 vaccine-related Twitter data. When attempting to perform sentiment analysis, certain methodological steps need to be considered after data collection, including data pre-processing, technique selection and model construction, as well as model evaluation and results interpretation. Both supervised and unsupervised sentiment analysis methods are investigated in the model construction step, with the former involving the implementation of Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression algorithms, and the latter involving the use of TextBlob and Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) sentiment analysis tools. The performance of each algorithm and tool is evaluated, as is the performance of each sentiment detection approach in order to select the best performing one. Social media platforms have become a common source of information and misinformation regarding vaccines. Our effort aims to emphasize the importance of mining such readily available public attitudes, as well as forecast opinions and reactions related to vaccine uptake in near real-time.

Users shop and pay through digital wallets in the expanding metaverse by pairing blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI). The relationships discussed in this discursive chapter focused on the company’s identification and customers’ repeat usage underpinned by the means-end chain theory, social identity theory, and prospect theory. A critical review of relevant literature, predominantly from 1991 to 2021, was carried out. A research framework was formed where the second-order constructs included the hedonic value, utilitarian value, and BMPA trustworthiness. BMPA identification was mapped as the antecedent variable of repeat customers’ BMPA usage. There are three proposed control variables, namely, (1) past BMPA usage, (2) gender, and (3) age. Past studies signified that an increase in perceived hedonic value, utilitarian value, and trustworthiness was having a positive impact on a company’s identification. A favorable company’s identification leads to an increase in repeat customers’ usage. However, the relationship was observed to be indirect. Perceived risk potentially moderates the relationship between company’s identification and repeat customers’ usage negatively. Using the dimension of customer value and customer behavior, this chapter recommends a Customer Outcome Framework for businesses that adopt the BMPAs. This chapter utilizes a sum of customer value and risk factors to provide suggestions for BMPA usage based on various stakeholder perceptions.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security']"

In MAPD-TS, we consider the synchronization of the movement of transportation agents with that of external agents, such as trucks arriving and departing from time to time in a warehouse and elevators that transfer materials to and from different floors in a construction site. We then propose methods via which agents autonomously select the tasks for improving overall efficiency by reducing unnecessary waiting times. MAPD is an abstract formation of material transportation tasks, and a number of methods have been proposed only for efficiency and collision-free movement in closed systems. However, as warehouses and construction sites are not isolated closed systems, transportation agents must sometimes synchronize with external agents to achieve real efficiency, and our MAPD-TS is the abstract form of this situation. In our proposed methods for MAPD-TS, agents approximately estimate their arrival time at the carry-in/out port connected with external agents and autonomously select the task to perform next for improved synchronization. Thereafter, we evaluate the performance of our methods by comparing them with the baseline algorithms. We demonstrate that our proposed algorithms reduce the waiting times of both agents and external agents and thus could improve overall efficiency.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Any person having diabetes is likely to develop diabetic retinopathy (DR). DR is triggered by high blood sugar due to diabetes. After some time, having excessive amount of sugar in blood, can damage retina. When sugar jams the tiny blood vessels the eyes are damaged and this will affect the blood vessels and result in leakage of fluid. Millions of working aged adults suffers from loss of sight due to diabetic retinopathy. DR cannot be treated completely, but early detection of DR prevents the person from vision loss. We proposed a deep learning model for detection of diabetic retinopathy. Detection of DR is a slow process. Physical detection of DR involves a trained clinician to study and estimate the color fundus photographs of the retina. Normal process of identification takes a minimum of two days. In our paper, convolutional neural network architecture has been used to classify images into two classes which is no-diabetic retinopathy and with diabetic retinopathy. APTOS-2019 blindness detection dataset has been used from Kaggle which contains high-resolution retinal images. Those images are used to train the model.

In today's social network services, there are numerous users with the ability to spread information, called “influencers”. However, even if they post the same content, the reactions they receive vary from user to user. Therefore, it is useful to create an index that represents the diffusion ability of each account to analyze diffusion behavior in social network services. In general, the diffusion status of information on Twitter is often quantified in terms of the number of RTs, Likes, and impressions of tweets alone. In this novel method, we propose a method for extracting indicators that show the diffusion power, not of tweets alone, but users as a unit, by measuring the ratio of the number of RTs and Likes based on the number of RTs and Likes of users in the past. The index obtained by this method can be used as an indicator for analyzing diffusion behavior on Twitter and may help conduct a more granular analysis. In this study, we conducted an experiment in which we collected tweets from 10 international celebrities for three years, divided them into multiple time series types, and applied this method to qualitatively evaluate them from the tweet text. The results showed that a bias exists when the period covered by the method is narrow, but when measured over a periodic unit of one year, there was no significant blurring, and it was possible to determine the status of the user in terms of the tweet text.

About 50 million people worldwide are affected by epilepsy and suffer from symptomatic seizures. Proper seizure management and medications for other elements of epilepsy are critical for the proper treatment of patients with epilepsy. However, epilepsy is very diverse, making it difficult to find the optimal treatment for each patient. Therefore, early and optimized detection of epilepsy is important to find the right treatment for individual patients. Recently, various machine learning methods have been used in clinical and experimental analysis, including automatic epilepsy detection, pre-surgical planning, automatic neuroimage analysis, etc. In this study, a model for classifying subgroups of epilepsy in magnetic resonance images (MRI) is proposed. To evaluate the classification performance, we used machine quantum learning (QML) techniques, which are more efficient than traditional deep learning classification. This QML working strategy is related to quantum computing. We have used quantum convolutional neural network (QCCN) to predict the epilepsy class. This QML in a special classification test, the proposed model outperformed the conventional deep learning models. The effectiveness of quantum simulation is faster for large one-sided classification tasks due to its convergence property. QML is able to handle large biased datasets, including the highest and fastest classification computations, while consuming less time and space. To make the proposed model more trustworthy and reliable, we used Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to explain the prediction process of our model. LRP creates a heat map in the input space, similar to other visualization approaches that illustrate the importance/relevance of features that contribute to the final classification.

This blockchain platform is used as a base technique for sharing information among users. However, when important information is shared through the blockchain platform, there is a disadvantage that other users can access the shared information. In the information service using the blockchain platform, it may be necessary to share defined users. Limited user's access to sharing information is allowed, but unauthorized user's access may have to be denied. To satisfy this requirement, this study proposes a model that can share confidential documents in a blockchain environment. The proposed confidential document sharing model operates on the blockchain platform and has the advantage of not using a key management server. If the proposed model is applied to the enterprise environment, it has the advantage of sharing confidential information while keeping all the advantages provided by the blockchain environment. However, since this study focused on the method on confidential file sharing, the sharing performance is inferior to other techniques, so additional research is needed.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Most textual contents are unstructured and messy forms, which are impractical and cumbersome to organize or manipulate by human experts. Therefore, developing an automatic short text classification model concerning low-resource languages, including Bengali, is critical. Moreover, the crucial barrier to classifying short text in Bengali is the unavailability of text corpora, scarcity of linguistics tools, a limited number of words in the text, and a lack of dependencies between the words. This paper presents a short text classification model using the ensemble of four base deep learning classifiers (Neural Network (NN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU)). Additionally, a corpus of around 0.13 million Bengali texts is developed for short text classification into six categories (e.g., international, national, sports, amusement, technology, and politics).

Over the course of the pandemic, a debate has emerged about the appropriate democratic and technopolitical response when governments use disease surveillance technologies to tackle the spread of COVID-19, pointing out the dichotomy between state-Leviathan cybercontrol and civil liberties. The COVID-19 pandemic has inevitably raised the need to resiliently and technopolitically respond to democratic threats that hyperconnected and highly virialised societies produce. In order to shed light on this debate, amidst this volume on “democratic deepening”, this chapter introduces the new term “postpandemic technopolitical democracy” as a way to figure out emerging forms and scales for developing democracy and citizen participation in hyperconnected and highly virialised postpandemic societies. Insofar as the digital layer cannot be detached from the current democratic challenges of the twenty-first century including neoliberalism, scales, civic engagement, and action research-driven co-production methodologies; this chapter suggests a democratic toolbox encompassing four intertwined factors including (i) the context characterised by the algorithmic nations, (ii) challenges stemming from data sovereignty, (iii) mobilisation seen from the digital rights perspective, and (iv) grassroots innovation embodied through data cooperatives.

However, this task is very challenging due to missing or diffuse organ/tissue boundaries. However, deep learning frameworks based on the U-Net backbone have gained immense popularity since those can deal with image inconsistencies. This study compared U-Net’s performance with a marker-controlled watershed algorithm, a traditional segmentation algorithm. We tried to find which method is more efficient for polyp and overlapping cell segmentation. These two segmentation tasks were chosen since they are the most challenging task in medical history. The study of cell morphology is of great importance since it helps to understand the structure and conditions of cells, which helps us understand our underlying health conditions. A necessary before understanding cell morphology is cell segmentation. Polyps are protrusions from the inner lining of the colon or rectum which turns into colorectal cancer if left untreated. Thus, accurate segmentation of the polyp region is essential to help the physician properly diagnose the disease. In this work, we have used the KVASIR dataset to report the performance of the U-Net and watershed algorithm for polyp segmentation. A private dataset cultured on HeLa cell line was used for cell segmentation. Watershed algorithm obtained higher accuracy of 91.34% over U-Net which obtained accuracy 80.46% for cell segmentation.

Advances in engineering equipment allowed vast data collection and thus opened a possibility for data-driven prediction of geological conditions. For an accurate prediction, the integration of various data sources is required, which makes the predictions complex and time-consuming for specialists. The application of machine learning (ML) methods provides a shortcut in analyzing complex data to predict geological conditions. In this work, the authors present a new approach for predicting the geological information ahead of the tunnel face by using an ensemble of ML methods combined with an oversampling technique. Implicit dimensionality reduction is introduced to deal with nonlinear coupling between seismic data: unsupervised machine learning methods are used to cluster the seismic data from two underground construction sites. Obtained information on clusters is then integrated with various seismic and geological variables, and a supervised machine learning model is trained to predict the rock mass class and/or the rock type. The data is over-sampled to avoid biased results when the training datasets are imbalanced and a mix of real and synthesized data is used in training, while an accuracy check is performed only on real data. Our results show that the proposed ML ensemble model has high accuracy in predicting geological conditions. Furthermore, the application of the oversampling technique helps to improve the accuracy of the ML predictors further.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Statistics, general']"

The research questions of the study are as follows: (1) What kinds of emotions do learners experience in simulation-based learning situations? (2) Through what kinds of SRL operations do learners aim to overcome challenging situations during simulation-based learning? and (3) In what kinds of situations could an AI tutor be used to facilitate simulation-based learning? To collect data, a 1-week experiment was conducted in August 2021. The data was collected using online observations, video recordings, and delayed stimulated recall interviews. The interview data was analyzed through a deductive thematic analysis process. The results of the study show that learners experienced various positive and negative emotions and emotions are deeply connected with learning. We need to do more research to describe these connections in more detail. According to the results, an AI tutor can provide help for decision-making and visualizing critical points and help learners ask questions to check vital points in the system.","['Psychology', 'Psychology, general', 'Computer Applications', 'Education, general', 'Philosophy of Mind', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

To apply WtA, the researcher repeatedly tested the hospitality service of Conrad Seoul Hotel, identified the Blueprint of the hospitality service based on personal experience, and pinpointed a total of eight Moment of Truth (MOT) that have a significant impact on customer experience through Customer Journey Analysis. By applying WtA to the identified MOT, the difference in perception between users and related parties regarding the service was confirmed. First, when looking at Conrad Seoul Hotel's hospitality service from the perspective of CEM, Conrad Seoul Hotel provided various promotional programs and experienced services to users, and through this, users could experience the unique and impressive hospitality service of Conrad Seoul Hotel. However, in terms of the service provided, there was a large difference in service awareness between the users who experienced main services such as room service and promotion program experience, food & Beverage (F&B), and related parties providing services, as the users who experienced services provided by the related parties implied relatively negative encounters. Therefore, if Conrad Seoul Hotel can improve this process in terms of user experience management, the hospitality service quality of Conrad Seoul Hotel can be further improved. As such, this study is meaningful in that it has laid the foundation for understanding customer experience management more clearly and broadly by applying the customer experience management technique to the practical case of a hotel.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

However, when completing the step of unsupervised pre-training step, the decoder portion is deprecated and will never be employed when fine-tuning image classification problems. As a result, maintaining a symmetrical architecture is not nearly necessary [ 1 ]. However, new complications develop when the asymmetrical architecture is used, despite the fact that it is a quite appealing decision. This shows that if the asymmetrical architectures of CVAEs are planned to improve, one needs to evaluate the architectures of each partition on its own before making any changes to the architectures as a whole. In addition, for the correct forwarding of the asymmetrical CVAEs, it is essential to make certain that the decoder appropriately fits the resolution of the raw input data in the appropriate manner. This also adds another layer of complication to the manual design process for VAE designs.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It also aims to cultivate and expand the abilities of students by enriching teaching contents and optimizing teaching methods through the Future-Ready Curriculum using a modified Attracting, Informing, Positioning and Delivering model. The development of FRFMC is extremely important as it can be used a means to attract non-finance students background to show interest in studying finance. Furthermore, the FRFMC dramatically changed the way higher-educational institutions, specifically educators in a financial management course to engage more efficiently and effectively with their new batches of digitally native and technologically savvy students. The reality is, many students are now on remote learning mode, highly depending on technology especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. While many students are considered sophisticated users of technology, few non-finance students are found struggling to learn the basics of finance for entrepreneurs. The FRFMC intends to cater to both groups of students. A number of 431 questionnaire surveys were collected among the non-finance student of Universiti Malaysia Kelantan and observations was adopted as the mechanisms to examine the students’ experience during the FRFMC implementation. The findings show that financial management courses can indeed be taught in a more innovative and effective way in order to draw the interest of non-finance students to take up more technical courses in the future.","['Engineering', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Business Mathematics', 'Data Engineering']"

The applications of AI and ML are proving disruptive across the global technological spectrum, and there is practically no area which has been left untouched by these technologies right from computer science to manufacturing, healthcare, insurance, credit ratings, cybersecurity, and many more. It would not be an exaggeration to say that it is the next big thing after the advent of the Internet and potentially holds a similar impact in touching the lives of human beings. Whilst most researchers using machine learning in research across diverse domains do not need to look beyond the model abstraction for their work, the need for understanding what is happening beneath the surface is sometimes necessary. This becomes especially important in the cases where the predictions are too good to be apparently true, and the researcher running the model is not sure about its validity as the logic for prediction is obscure. The process of feature engineering brings in more accuracy to predictions, but in the absence of intuitive background information regarding the features, the task gets more challenging. The scientific reasoning has been driven by logic through ages, and the scientist community remains sceptical of the results unless they can extract useful insights from the black box ML models. The paper applies five popular explainability algorithms being used by the research community to demystify the abstract nature of ML black box models and compare the relative clarity of the insights being provided individually by each from a practitioner’s perspective using the publicly available UCI wine quality dataset.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

Although parking maneuvering has reached the level of fully automated valet parking, there are still many challenges to realize the parking motion planning in the presence of dynamic obstacles. One of the most famous autonomous driving platforms is the Baidu Apollo platform. In the Apollo platform, this problem is solved using the classic method hybrid A*. However, this method has two main downsides. Firstly, it generates in some parking scenarios, trajectories that consist of many partitions with different gear types and sizes. Such trajectories are intractable by a self-driving car when testing the Apollo planner on more realistic data coming from a simulator such as SVL. Secondly, the built-in algorithm does not have the ability to interact with dynamic obstacles, which might lead to a collision in some critical parking scenarios. To overcome these issues, we proposed a method based on reinforcement learning, which uses the RL-policy (from POLAMP) allowing us to take into account the kinematic constraints of the vehicle, static and dynamic obstacles. The proposed method was fully integrated into the Apollo platform with developed Cyber RT nodes, which were used for publishing the parking trajectory from our algorithm to the SVL simulator through a ROS/Cyber bridge.

By May 2021, nearly, 172 million people worldwide were affected by the infectious spread of COVID-19. While the distribution of vaccines has already begun, mass distribution around the world has yet to take place. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), wearing a face mask can significantly reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus. However, even improper wearing of face mask can prevent the purposes and lead to the spread of the virus. Under the influence of public health and the global economy, an effective Covid-19 pandemic strategy requires a lot of attention of humanity. To prevent the spread of such deadly virus, intelligent techniques are required. In the proposed work, an intelligent face mask detector framework is proposed based on deep learning concept which can classify the person who wear mask from those who are not wearing mask. In the proposed work, a hybrid model of convolution neural network with support vector machine is used for designing the mask detector. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on real-world masked face recognition dataset (RMFD) and medical mask dataset (MDD). When implemented, it has been found that the proposed method can achieve high accuracy (99.11%). The excellent performance of the proposed model is very suitable for video surveillance equipment also.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Information Storage and Retrieval']"

To prevent the spread of the Covid-19, people must wear a mask during conversation, shopping, or studying. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an application that helps to verify whether people wear a face mask or not. Many approaches have been proposed to detect a facemask based on using machine learning-based methods, such as support vector machines, and convolutional neural networks. However, the performance of existing systems still has limitations under difficult deployment environments where the camera's quality is not good enough for detection. Therefore, in this research, we study the benefits of generative adversarial networks to produce a stable feature for robust deep learning model-based facemask detection. First, the generative adversarial network is used to learn and discover stable features from the input dataset. Second, the Yolo is then employed to learn the stable feature to effectively detect and recognize facemasks under various testing conditions. With comprehensive experimental results, we found that our proposed method achieved a detection rate of 84.45% by using the MaskedFace-Net dataset.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"
