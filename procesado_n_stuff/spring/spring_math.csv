The numerical elucidations of the governing equations achieved for various values of flow fields are taken out for the several parameters inflowing into the problem and solved by raising the Galerkin finite element technique. By taking the range of the magnetic field parameter 0 ≤ M ≤ 5, the range of viscosity ratio parameter is 0 ≤ β ≤ 5, and micro-gyration parameter is 0 ≤ n ≤ 5, whereas the value of Grashof number lies in 0 ≤ Gr ≤ 2 and −2 ≤ Gr ≤ 0. The numerical results and impact on the translation velocity and temperature are presented and discussed through graphs and listed in the tables. With an increase of β and Gr , the velocity increases, and the reverse effect is found with enhancing of M and n . With enhanced values of M, n, Pr , and R , the result in C f rises.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"
doi:10.1007/s42757-021-0109-3,en,A review for measurements and simulations of swirling gas-particle flows,"['ReviewPaper', 'Review Article']","Swirling gas-particle (droplet) flows are commonly encountered in gas-turbine combustors, cyclone combustors, and furnace burners. To better understand the flow behavior, many investigators did measurements, RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes) simulation, and LES (large-eddy simulation) of these types of flows. Most studies were done for weakly swirling gas-particle flows with swirl numbers less than unity. Experimental and numerical studies were done by the present author and his colleagues for PDPA measurements of swirling gas-particle flows with swirl numbers greater than unity, Reynolds-averaged two-fluid (Eulerian-Eulerian) simulation using k-ε-k p and USM (unified second-order moment) two-phase turbulence models, and two-fluid LES using a two-phase sub-grid stress model. The measurement and simulation results give the two-phase time-averaged and RMS fluctuation velocities, and particle concentration distribution, showing the complex recirculation structures in the two-phase axial velocities and the Rankine-vortex structures in the two-phase tangential velocities, the anisotropic two-phase turbulence properties, and the effect of swirl number on the two-phase flow behavior. The simulation results show that the two-fluid approach using the k-ε-k p and USM two-phase turbulence models are better than the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach for simulating swirling gas-particle flows","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

The proposed numerical model was applied to simulate the cone calorimeter test of two kinds of materials: (i) pinewood (charring) and (ii) low-density polyethylene (non-charring). Using a cone calorimeter setup, good agreement has been achieved between the computational and the experimental results. The model is capable of predicting the formation of the char layer and thus replicating the flame suppressing thermal and barrier effects. Furthermore, with the application of detailed chemical kinetics, the fire model was able to aptly predict the generation of asphyxiant gas such as CO/CO 2 during the burning process. However, the pinewood experiments showed significant CO/CO 2 emissions post flame extinguishment attributed to char oxidation effects, which were not considered by the fire model. Despite the limitation, the fully coupled LES model proposed in this study was capable of predicting the fluid mechanics and heat transfer for the turbulent reacting flow, solid-phase decomposition, and gaseous products under flaming conditions. In the future, it can be further extended to include char oxidation mechanisms to improve predictions for charring materials.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

In the past 50 years, several structural concepts have been proposed, but none have been sent into orbit. One of the main challenges of the SSPS is dynamic behavior prediction, which can supply the necessary information for control strategy design. The ultra-large size of the SSPS causes difficulties in its dynamic analysis, such as the ultra-low vibration frequency and large flexibility. In this paper, four approaches for the numerical analysis of the dynamic problems associated with the SSPS are reviewed: the finite element, absolute nodal coordinate, floating frame formulation, and structure-preserving methods. Both the merits and shortcomings of the above four approaches are introduced when they are employed in dynamic problems associated with the SSPS. Synthesizing the merits of the aforementioned four approaches, we believe that embedding the structure-preserving method into finite element software may be an effective way to perform a numerical analysis of the dynamic problems associated with the SSPS.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

Given that there are several special advantages of space relative navigation using angles-only measurements from passive optical sensors, angles-only relative navigation is considered as one of the best potential approaches in the field of space relative navigation. However, angles-only relative navigation is well-known for its range observability problem. To overcome this observability problem, many studies have been conducted over the past decades. In this study, we present a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art space relative navigation based on angles-only measurements. The emphasis is on the observability problem and solutions to angles-only relative navigation, where the review of the solutions is categorized into four classes based on the intrinsic principle: complicated dynamics approach, multi-line of sight (multi-LOS) approach, sensor offset center-of-mass approach, and orbit maneuver approach. Then, the flight demonstration results of angles-only relative navigation in the two projects are briefly reviewed. Finally, conclusions of this study and recommendations for further research are presented.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

For some potential missions, the orbits of interest are selected as nearly stable to reduce the possibility of rapid departure. However, the linearly stable nature of these orbits is also a drawback for their timely insertion into or departure from the orbit. Stable or nearly stable near rectilinear halo orbits (NRHOs), distant retrograde orbits (DROs), and lunar orbits offer potential long-horizon trajectories for exploration missions and demand efficient operations. The current investigation focuses on leveraging stretching directions as a tool for departure and trajectory design applications. The magnitude of the state variations along the maximum stretching direction is expected to grow rapidly and, therefore, offers information for efficient departure from the orbit. Similarly, maximum stretching in reverse time enables arrival with a minimal maneuver magnitude.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

This is analyzed in this work with a novel method that combines the definition of a suitable homotopy with a classical perturbation approach, in which the low thrust is assumed to be a perturbation of the nominal Keplerian motion.

The novelty of the interface capturing method used here lies on the advection of level set which is solved with a WENO scheme and corrected with a novel re-initialisation method for retaining its signed distance function character. The coupling with the volume of fluid method is done with a simple algebraic approach, and with the new algorithm the accumulated mass conservation errors remain reasonably low. The paper presents a unique coupling between the level set method and the Eulerian–Lagrangian Spray Atomisation approach for modelling spray dispersion in liquid atomisation systems. The method is shown to have good accuracy providing similar results to other numerical codes for the classical tests presented. Preliminary results are also shown for three-dimensional simulations of the primary break-up of a turbulent liquid jet obtaining results comparable to direct numerical simulations. Consequently, the coupled method can be used for simulating various two-phase flow applications offering an accurate representation of the interface dynamics.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

In this study, a new MEN system TiNbWN, forming a single fcc solution, is designed and its wear performance at temperatures ranging from 25 to 750 °C is explored. The wear mechanisms can be rationalized by examining the subsurface microstructural evolutions using the transmission electron microscopy as well as calculating the phase diagrams and interfacial adhesion behavior employing calculation of phase diagram (CALPHAD) and density functional theory (DFT). To be specific, increased wear losses occur in a temperature range of 25–600 °C, being predominantly caused by the thermally-induced hardness degradation; whereas at the ultimate temperature (750 °C), the wear loss is refrained due to the formation of nanocrystalline oxides (W n O 3 n −2 , TiO 2 , and γ TiO x ), as synergistically revealed by microscopy and CALPHAD, which not only enhance the mechanical properties of the pristine nitride film, but also act as solid lubricants, reducing the interfacial adhesion. Thus, our work delineates the role of the in situ formed nanocrystalline oxides in the wear mechanism transition of TiNbWN thin films, which could shed light on the high-temperature wear behavior of refractory HEN/MEN films.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

Our key observation is that to recover the underlying structures as well as surface details, given partial input, a fundamental component is a good feature representation that can capture both global structure and local geometric details. We accordingly first propose FSNet, a feature structuring module that can adaptively aggregate point-wise features into a 2D structured feature map by learning multiple latent patterns from local regions. We then integrate FSNet into a coarse-to-fine pipeline for point cloud completion. Specifically, a 2D convolutional neural network is adopted to decode feature maps from FSNet into a coarse and complete point cloud. Next, a point cloud upsampling network is used to generate a dense point cloud from the partial input and the coarse intermediate output. To efficiently exploit local structures and enhance point distribution uniformity, we propose IFNet, a point upsampling module with a self-correction mechanism that can progressively refine details of the generated dense point cloud. We have conducted qualitative and quantitative experiments on ShapeNet, MVP, and KITTI datasets, which demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art point cloud completion approaches.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']"

Herein, we focus on the recent research progress pertaining to the wet friction modification of soft elastomers via texturing. To consider the pertinent physical mechanisms, we present and discuss the fundamentals of wet sliding on soft surfaces (including dewetting and wetting transitions in compliant contacts). Subsequently, we consider the methods in which the characteristic textures regulate and control wet sliding behaviors on soft surfaces; these textures range from conventional patterns of dimples to bioinspired architectures and can either positively or adversely impact the interfacial friction force. Furthermore, we briefly address the perspectives, potential applications, and challenges of texture design for modifying the friction characteristics of soft materials.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"
doi:10.1007/s42757-021-0125-3,en,Towards the efficient modelling of trapped air pockets during squeeze flow,"['OriginalPaper', 'Research Article']","In most bonding processes, an adhesive is applied to a substrate in a specific pattern before the second substrate is subsequently pressed against it. During this, the adhesive flows in such a way that, ideally, it completely fills the joint. In practice, however, areas with entrapped air frequently remain in the bonded adhesive layer. Within the scope of a research project, these flows are systematically analyzed in order to identify optimal initial application patterns for the adhesive and substrate geometry to minimise such risks. For this purpose, the authors use an efficient flow model, the partially filled gaps model (PFGM), extended in this study to include the functionality of trapped air pockets. Depending on the volume fractions of air and adhesive, the flow of both phases is computed. Therefore, the model is introduced and fully described, benchmarked with respect to its plausibility and functionality, and results obtained are compared with a CFD calculation. Thereafter, the functionality of openings and closings of the pockets are analyzed. Lastly, the model is then applied to a real scenario created with a Hele–Shaw cell measurement. The benchmark as well as the comparison with the measurement results show the high potential of this technique.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

Although suppression behaviours between hydrocarbon-fuelled fire and water-based suppression agents were extensively studied both numerically and experimentally, lack of numerical studies was conducted on fires involving water-reactive chemicals (i.e., Na, Li, and LiH), where extinguishment is barely performed by water-based active suppression system, as violent and explosive decomposition occurred between water and reactive fuel. In this research, a numerical investigation has been conducted on expandable graphite (EG) application for water-reactive fire suppression. Based on the discrete phase model (DPM) framework, a novel EG particle model is proposed to characterise the particle expansion that couples with superior thermal properties and chemical stability. A numerical assessment on large eddy simulation (LES) has been performed to study the temporal fire behaviours and the suppression effect of EG against the flame plume in various subgrid-scale (SGS) models. Four SGS models were adopted, which were namely Smagorinsky-Lilly, WALE, dynamic kinetic energy, and dynamic Smagorinsky-Lilly. As a result, the WALE SGS model was observed to be in a better agreement compared with the experimental data owing to its significant enhancement in flow diffusivity modelling. The WALE SGS model has achieved a more accurate temperature prediction and finer resolved turbulence compared with other SGS models.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Fluid- and Aerodynamics', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology']"

However, it is quite challenging as human facial images contain large areas of similar textures, rich expressions, and large rotations. These characteristics also result in the scarcity of large, annotated real-world datasets. We propose a robust and accurate method to learn facial optical flow in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, we utilize various shape priors, including face depth, landmarks, and parsing, to guide the self-supervised learning task via a differentiable nonrigid registration framework.

This issue has rarely been considered in studies pertaining to erosion damage. In the present study, the ABAQUS software is used to investigate the erosion crater morphology and stress distribution on a target material subjected to overlapping impacts of spherical particles. Subsequently, the validated model is applied to investigate the effect of the overlapping impacts of particles on the target. Accordingly, the correlation between erosion severity and the impact locations of the two incident particles is quantified. The results show that the horizontal distance between two solid particle impact locations can significantly affect the erosion magnitude and pattern. The interactions of the resulting craters diminish when the horizontal distance exceeds 0.6 times the particle diameter. When the horizontal distance is approximately 0.06 times the particle diameter, the energy loss originating from collisions reaches the maximum, which modifies the crater morphology. The present study is expected to provide in-depth insights into erosion mechanisms and erosion modeling.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"
doi:10.1007/s40544-021-0590-5,en,Surroundings affect slip length dynamics in nanoscale friction through contact stiffness and damping,"['OriginalPaper', 'Research Article']","Friction force microscopy (FFM) explores the interaction in a sliding contact on the nanoscale, providing information on the frictional dynamics and lateral contact stiffness with lattice resolution. Recent FFM measurements on a NaCl crystal immersed in liquid (ethanol) surroundings displayed an increase of the effective contact stiffness, K eff , with the applied load, differently from similar measurements performed under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, where K eff showed negligible load dependency. Additionally, under UHV conditions multiple slip length friction with increasing load was reported, while in ethanol surroundings only single (lattice unit length) slips were observed. Our current understanding of this behavior relates the transition from single jumps to multiple jumps dynamics to the normal load (manifested through the amplitude of the interaction potential at the contact, U 0 ) and to the damping of the system. Here we have incorporated the effect of the load dependency on both U 0 and K eff within Prandtl—Tomlinson based simulations, accompanied by variations in the damping coefficient of the system. Introducing the experimentally observed load dependency to K eff resulted indeed in single slip jumps at critical damping, while multiple slip jumps were obtained at constant K eff . The average slip length increased with the normal load, particularly when the system became underdamped. Our work provides a glimpse on the relation between the characteristic observables in atomic-scale sliding friction (maximal slip forces, stiffness, and slip dynamics) with respect to their governing parameters (corrugation energy, effective stiffness, and damping). While common understanding in nanotribology relates the effect of surrounding media mainly to the interaction potential at the contact, here we show that the media can also greatly affect the elastic interaction, and consequently play an important role on the transition from single to multiple stick-slip.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Nanotechnology', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films']"

doi:10.1007/s00376-022-2164-5,en,A Quantitative Method of Detecting Transient Rossby Wave Phase Speed: No Evidence of Slowing Down with Global Warming,"['OriginalPaper', 'Original Paper']","Based on the Complex Empirical Orthogonal Functions (CEOFs) of bandpass-filtered daily streamfunction fields, a quantitative method of detecting transient (synoptic) Rossby wave phase speed (RWPhS) is presented. The transient RWPhS can be objectively calculated by the distance between a high (or low) center in the real part of a CEOF mode and its counterpart in the imaginary part of the same CEOF mode divided by the time span between two adjacent peaks (or bottoms) of two principal component curves for the real and imaginary parts of that CEOF mode. The new detection method may partly reveal the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of Rossby wave prorogation. Although the mean westerly jet at 200 hPa doubles the speed of its counterpart at 500 hPa, the estimated RWPhS at both levels are around 1000 km d −1 and quantitatively consistent with the quasigeostrophic-theory-based RWPhS, confirming that the meridional potential vorticity gradient induced by the barotropic and baroclinic shears of mean flow, together with the β effect, play an essential role in Rossby wave propagation. Both observations over the past four decades and a 150-year historical simulation suggest no evidence for slowing wintertime transient Rossby waves in the Northern Hemisphere, but possible regional changes are not excluded. We emphasize that not only the mean flow speed, but also the barotropic and baroclinic shears of the mean flow, and their associated contributions to the meridional potential vorticity (PV) gradient, should be considered in investigating the possible change of Rossby waves with global warming. 本文提出了一种定量计算瞬变罗斯贝波相速度（RWPhS）的方法。该方法通过对带通滤波处理后的流函数场做复经验正交函数（CEOF）分解得到CEOF 实部和虚部异常中心对的距离，并将其除以复主分量实部和虚部曲线极值点间隔的时长便得到RWPhS。此方法一定程度上揭示了罗斯贝波传播的时空不均匀性。虽然200 hPa高度上的平均西风急流风速是500 hPa的两倍，但在两个高度上计算得到的RWPhS都约为每天1000 公里，与基于准地转理论得到的RWPhS相一致。这证明了由正压风切变、斜压风切变以及β效应所产生的经向位涡梯度在瞬变罗斯贝波传播中的重要作用。根据40年再分析资料和150年历史模拟结果的计算都说明了北半球冬季瞬变罗斯贝波传播整体上并未减慢，但这并不排除其可能的局地变化。本文强调了在研究罗斯贝波随全球变暖的变化时，除了要考虑平均西风风速变化本身的作用，还应考虑正压风切变和斜压风切变所产生的经向位涡梯度在罗斯贝波传播速度变化中对西风影响的抵消作用。","['Earth Sciences', 'Atmospheric Sciences', 'Meteorology', 'Geophysics/Geodesy']"

Six simulations are run for the Chinese mainland on 0.1° × 0.1° grids from 1979 to 2008, and the simulated monthly soil moisture (SM), evapotranspiration (ET), and snow depth (SD) are then compared and assessed against observations. The results show that the meteorological forcing is the most important factor governing output. Beyond that, SM seems to be also very sensitive to soil texture information; SD is also very sensitive to snow parameterization scheme in the LSM. The Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5), driven by newly developed observation-based regional meteorological forcing and land surface parameters (referred to as CMFD_CLM4.5_NEW), significantly improved the simulations in most cases over the Chinese mainland and its eight basins. It increased the correlation coefficient values from 0.46 to 0.54 for the SM modeling and from 0.54 to 0.67 for the SD simulations, and it decreased the root-mean-square error (RMSE) from 0.093 to 0.085 for the SM simulation and reduced the normalized RMSE from 1.277 to 0.201 for the SD simulations.

Multi-objective optimization could be an effective tool for tackling the aforementioned challenges. Therefore, this paper proposes a life-cycle optimization framework considering thermal comfort, which is beneficial to promoting residents’ motivation for low-carbon retrofit in arid climate regions. First, in response to the above problems, three objective functions are specified in the framework, which are global warming potential (GWP), life cycle cost (LCC), and thermal discomfort hours (TDH). To improve the optimization efficiency, this research uses Deep Neural Networks (DNN) combined with NSGA-II to construct a high-precision prediction model (meta-model for optimization) based on the energy consumption simulation database formed by the orthogonal multi-dimensional design parameters. The accuracy index of the modified model is R 2 > 0.99, cv(RMSE) ≤ 1%, and NMBE ≤ 0.2%, which gets rid of the dilemma of low prediction accuracy of traditional machine learning models. In the scheme comparison and selection stage, the TOPSIS based on two empowerment methods is applied to meet different design tendencies, where the entropy-based method can avoid the interference of subjective preference and significantly improve the objectivity and scientific nature of decision analysis. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is conducted on the variables, which supports guidance for practitioners to carry out the low-carbon design.

Assume that the insurer can purchase reinsurance from the reinsurer, and that both the insurer and the reinsurer are allowed to invest in a risk-free asset and a risky asset which are governed by the Heston model and are distinct from one another. We aim to find the optimal reinsurance-investment strategy by maximizing the expected Hyperbolic Absolute Risk Aversion (HARA) utility of the insurance corporation’s terminal wealth, which is the weighted sum of the insurer’s and the reinsurer’s terminal wealth. The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is first established. However, this equation is non-linear and is difficult to solve directly by any ordinary method found in the existing literature, because the structure of this HJB equation is more complex under HARA utility. In the present paper, the Legendre transform is applied to change this HJB equation into a linear dual one such that the explicit expressions of optimal investment-reinsurance strategies for −1 ≤ ρ i ≤ 1 are obtained. We also discuss some special cases in a little bit more detail. Finally, numerical analyses are provided.","['Mathematics', 'Mathematics, general', 'Analysis']"

The durations of advance payment and delayed payment are set by the supplier. Supplier also offers cash discount to the buyer due to advance payment. The rate of cash discount depends on the amount of advance payment made at the time of placing the order, which seems to be realistic in the present business world. It is often observed in the market that a large pile of goods on the shelf has positive affect on the demand; this model considers demand depending on instantaneous stock level of the commodity.

In this article, we present a systematic detailed review on these techniques in context of solving mathematical programming problems along with comprehensive review analysis. A systematic review procedure has been used for analysis of sixty-eight articles of reputed databases like Thomson Reuters, Web of Science, Scopus, and IEEE. The research gaps and future research scope for the researcher who inclines to solve different types of mathematical programming problems with these techniques are also identified. Relevance of the work : Mathematical programming problems (e.g., linear programming problem (LPP), NLPP, MOPP, etc.) are important optimization problems in which many types of real-world problems are formulated. On other hand, PSO and GA are prominent natured-inspired techniques used to solve complex optimization problems. This article presents comprehensive review analysis on PSO and GA in context of solving different types of mathematical programming problems. This review work also narrates the unique linkage between GA–PSO techniques and mathematical programming problems. This systematic and in-depth review analysis will be useful to the researchers and scientists working in the related areas of mathematical programming and natured-inspired optimization techniques to pursue carrying out further research in these areas.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Big Data', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks']"

The two most common probabilistic models of network reliability are the all-terminal and the two-terminal reliability ones, with k-terminal reliability modeling the whole spectrum. For any of these models, the reliability of a network is represented by a polynomial in p . While the roots of all-terminal reliability polynomials have been extensively studied, only a small fraction of papers has converged on the roots of two-terminal reliability polynomials. A particular sub-class of two-terminal networks is represented by composition of series and parallel . Obviously, networks formed by composition are expected to be easier to understand, exhibiting kind of simpler/regular reliability polynomials. Additionally, compositions of series and parallel networks have been shown to be highly competitive on improving the reliability of networks doing computations—even when compared to hammock networks (a particular sub-class of two-terminal networks introduced by Moore and Shannon in 1956). Neither the roots associated to the reliability polynomials of hammock networks, nor those of composition of series and parallel networks have yet been investigated. In this paper we are going to start filling such voids by studying the roots of the two-terminal reliability polynomials associated to series and parallel compositions. This is an early stage investigation which will lead to several conjectures while also suggesting further directions for research.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Computational Intelligence']"

One broadly proposed explanation for this phenomenon was the common culture shared by East Asian countries: Confucian Heritage Culture (CHC). Instead of analyzing features of CHC and relating them to mathematics achievement in general ways, this chapter explores more specifically how culture may have affected East Asian students’ mathematics achievement in a more direct way by discussing research findings from two areas of enquiry – The first is from research involving secondary data analyses of international studies such as TIMSS and PISA. These studies provide evidence for common patterns of strengths and weaknesses in mathematics performance and other educational practices shared by East Asian students. The second is from research that investigated the differences in linguistic structure in English and in East Asian languages such as Chinese, and clinical studies on the impact of the differences on the performance of speakers of the different languages when they process the mathematics items. The chapter concludes that there are many commonalities in educational practices and patterns of students’ mathematics performance among the East Asian countries, indicating that the countries may form a cultural cluster. Notably, East Asian languages appear to influence mathematics learning and assessment in ways different from Western languages, and some features of the Chinese language may prove to be beneficial for students’ mathematics learning. Finally, implications of the discussions above are highlighted.","['Education', 'International and Comparative Education', 'Education, general']"

The capacity of own warehouse is fixed (U units), to store more units than the limited range of OW, the supplier has to rent another warehouse (RW) at higher holding cost. We study two warehouse policies with linear holding cost and Pareto type decay in an inflationary environment.

Ultimately, sensitivity investigation has been executed to demonstrate the effects of diverse parameters of the inventory system.

This scheme aims to attain optimized solutions by maximizing the accuracy of the model and minimizing the functions like the computational burden. Mathematical-informed frameworks are to be employed to enable reliable, accurate, and robust understanding of various complex biological processes that involve a variety of spatial and temporal scales. This complexity requires a holistic understanding of different biological processes through multi-stage integrative models that are capable of capturing the significant attributes on the related scales. Fractional-order differential and integral equations can provide the generalization of traditional integral and differential equations through the extension of the conceptions with respect to biological processes. In addition, algorithmic complexity (computational complexity), as a way of comparing the efficiency of an algorithm, can enable a better grasping and designing of efficient algorithms in computational biology as well as other related areas of science. It also enables the classification of the computational problems based on their algorithmic complexity, as defined according to the way the resources are required for the solution of the problem, including the execution time and scale with the problem size. Based on a novel mathematical informed framework and multi-staged integrative method concerning algorithmic complexity, this study aims at establishing a robust and accurate model reliant on the combination of fractional-order derivative and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the diagnostic and differentiability predictive purposes for the disease, (diabetes, as a metabolic disorder, in our case) which may display various and transient biological properties. Another aim of this study is benefitting from the concept of algorithmic complexity to obtain the fractional-order derivative with the least complexity in order that it would be possible to achieve the optimized solution. To this end, the following steps were applied and integrated. Firstly, the Caputo fractional-order derivative with three-parametric Mittag-Leffler function $$(\alpha ,~\beta ,~\gamma )$$ ( α , β , γ ) was applied to the diabetes dataset. Thus, new fractional models with varying degrees were established by ensuring data fitting through the fitting algorithm Mittag-Leffler function with three parameters $$(\alpha ,~\beta ,~\gamma )$$ ( α , β , γ ) based on heavy-tailed distributions. Following this application, the new dataset, named the mfc_diabetes, was obtained. Secondly, classical derivative (calculus) was applied to the diabetes dataset, which yielded the cd_diabetes dataset. Subsequently, the performance of the new dataset as obtained from the first step and of the dataset obtained from the second step as well as of the diabetes dataset was compared through the application of the feed forward back propagation (FFBP) algorithm, which is one of the ANN algorithms. Next, the fractional order derivative model which would be the most optimal for the disease was generated. Finally, algorithmic complexity was employed to attain the Caputo fractional-order derivative with the least complexity, or to achieve the optimized solution. This approach through the application of fractional-order calculus to optimization methods and the experimental results have revealed the advantage of maximizing the model’s accuracy and minimizing the cost functions like the computational costs, which points to the applicability of the method proposed in different domains characterized by complex, dynamic and transient components.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Statistics, general', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In a pandemic, they can also, by identifying the causes of higher mortality, predict a higher number of hospitalizations in intensive care units. The theory of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), which is one of the first extensions of fuzzy sets of Zadeh, analyzes uncertain data. Uncertainty in data determines the need for the introduction of intuitionistic fuzzy HCISs (IFHCISs) for digital transformation of these processes which analyze uncertain data. The main determinant of the effectiveness of IFHCISs for diagnosing and treatment of diseases, prediction of ICU admission of patients during the pandemic and determining the main factors for higher mortality in pandemics is the optimal multicriteria system. An intuitionistic fuzzy interpretation of the classical rank correlation analyzes under the form of intercriteria analysis (ICrA) is proposed for optimizing each evaluation system of criteria in IFHCISs, based on the theories of index matrices and IFSs. The purpose of the chapter is to develop a model for successful optimization of multicriteria systems embedded in IFHCISs by expanding three-dimensional ICrA to multilayer ICrA (3-D MLICrA). The current pandemic situation raises problems about the dependence of pandemy deaths on certain factors. These problems have to process large data sets related to Covid’s mortality, some of which differ in the various reports. The effectiveness of 3-D MLICrA approach for optimizing the criteria of the IFHCIS is also demonstrated by an application on a dataset of total deaths attributed to COVID-19 and 15 key indicators of the European Union countries determining this mortality, provided by European Centre for DPC for 2021.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This approach offers an alternative to conventional university entrance criteria, establishing a means to better advice prospect university students on which degree streamline they are best suited for based on their displayed abilities. This will assist in the measures taken to reduce student attrition at universities. Student skill-sets are composed of pre-college marks (high school leaving results and National Benchmark Test scores) and home language. The composition of skill-sets is based on key student abilities associated with student university performance, and these are characterised as follows: mathematical ability, computer proficiency, academic literacy and language communication. The best performing prediction model proved to be the random forest classifier which gave an accuracy of 95%. This research, conducted at a South African research intensive institute, shows that skill-sets can be used as an alternative to current university entrance requirements as they provide a more holistic view of a student’s ability.

This study tried to examine and categorize proper conditions for mathematics teaching as a real-life utilization with a multi-criteria decision analysis and fuzzy-decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (MCDA and F-DEMATEL) method. Specifically, adjusting to present educational changes, it is about flipped classroom combined with sustainable development and information, communication, and technology (ICT) in mathematics teaching. In this case, the principal criteria and sub-criteria were carefully chosen after the discussion of an association of specialists as decision-makers with the MCDA and F-DEMATEL methods. Later, the final analyses’ findings were measured with simple additive weighting (SAW) throughout their weight coefficients’ result and susceptibility study with the chosen criteria and sub-criteria. The findings showed that the most significant criteria and sub-criteria for variation to present educational changes had been revealed to be based on the above-cited evaluation methodologies. Thus, this approach could be used to certify the most important flipped and sustainable mathematics teaching for adjusting to present educational changes with resultant learning environments in more long-term education. Hence, it could be related to decision-making defects in private sectors, at government sectors and more educational areas, which continually requires constant actualization of knowledge and distribution.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Optimization', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory']"

In this chapter, a four-dimensional hyperchaotic system is introduced and analyzed through calculation of bifurcation diagrams and Lyapunov exponents. The system is a modification of the system proposed by Li and Sprott (Int J Bifurcation Chaos 24:1450034, 2014) and a generalization of the system in Moysis et al. ( Int J Dyn Control:1–11, 2020). The system has no rest points and thus belongs to the category of systems with hidden attractors. The system is then applied to the problem of chaotic area exploration. The aim here is to combine the dynamics of the chaotic system with the motion dynamics of an autonomous robot exploring an area. This results into a chaotic and unpredictable motion that nonetheless ensures coverage of the given area. Such a technique can be useful for exploration or patrolling tasks. Numerical simulations are performed to study the coverage achieved with respect to simulation time. The case of multiple robots is also considered.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Plasma Physics', 'Applications of Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos Theory', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Complex Systems']"

The family of $$\phi $$ ϕ -divergence measures have supported a great variety of inference problems involving multinomial data. Because of this reason, an equivalence test based on those measures is proposed for this kind of data. The spirit is to incorporate little or irrelevant deviations between the observed data and the target population in the definition of the hypothesis to be tested. Such deviations can be measured by means of a $$\phi $$ ϕ -divergence measure, which in turn can be consistently estimated. An equivalence test based on that estimator is presented. The asymptotic behavior of the test statistic is studied and a critical region based on the asymptotic null distribution is considered. To study the finite sample performance of the proposal and to compare it with existing tests, several simulation experiments were carried out. In simulations, the new tests compete very satisfactorily in terms of power.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Data Engineering', 'Statistics for Engineering, Physics, Computer Science, Chemistry and Earth Sciences', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Mathematical Applications in Computer Science']"

The present paper addresses new simplified TOPSIS approach for the solution of generalized multilevel nonlinear multiobjective decision-making problems (MLN-MODM) incorporating major modifications in the interactive TOPSIS approach given by Baky (Appl Math Model 38:1417–1433, 2014) for MLN-MODM problems. In this work, we propose a simplified formulation model for membership functions of distance functions and for membership functions of decision variables. This avoids decision deadlock situations and repeated rejection of the solution in decision-making process for MLN-MODM problems due to the solution preference by the decision-makers. Finally, the same numerical example as taken by Baky (Appl Math Model 38:1417–1433, 2014) is illustrated with proposed simplified technique to show applicability of proposed method and similarity of results of both the approaches. Further, algorithmic comparison between suggested simplified TOPSIS approach and interactive TOPSIS approach by Baky (Appl Math Model 38:1417–1433, 2014) is also carried out to prove the simplicity of new simplified approach. The proposed simplified approach is presented as a simpler, efficient and less calculative than the earlier TOPSIS method in context of finding satisfactory solution of the problem.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Big Data', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks']"

The structure for analyzing Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) failures is presented in this chapter, which also allows for the identification of the most appropriate methods for removing them. It is also essential to have sufficient information on failure and repair in order to assess system availability and reliability and calculate exact performance rates. The model under consideration is made up of three distinct subsystems, namely subsystems A, B, and C. All the components designed for this system have access to exponential failure and repair. Failure times are thought to have an exponential distribution, whereas repair times are thought to have a General distribution and Gumbel–Hougaard family Copula. The transition diagram’s set of differential equations was solved using regenerative point techniques and Laplace transforms. For various assumed parameter values, different reliability characteristics such as availability, reliability, MTTF, sensitivity, and cost benefit are derived and validated to determine how the model under consideration affects them. A number of cases are used to demonstrate the analysis in depth. Tables are used to present computed results and while figures depicts the computed results. According to the computed results, Copula is a superior repair technique for improving the efficiency of repairable systems.

The unknown solution is interpolated based on the Vandermonde matrix through three matrices in total, one of which is a monomial matrix. Five matrices, two of which are monomial basis, are used to convert the interpolated singular kernel into a double-interpolated non-singular polynomial. A linear system is produced by substituting the interpolated unknown function into the integral equation. The unknown coefficients are obtained from the direct solution of this system, and then, the interpolated solution is obtained. Using the lowest degree of interpolation, the results for the two solved examples strongly converge to the exact ones.

In continuation of Casson fluid, magnetic field parameter is influenced by the presence of Eckert number. The governing partial differential equations are moulded to ordinary differential equations using similarity transformations.

Energy and mass equations were derived with the presence of thermal and solutal stratifications. The relevant variables are applied to remodel the obtained PDEs to non-linear ODE models. These models are solved with the implementation of homotopy analysis procedure. The LV, LT, LC, SFC, LNN and LSN are computed through graphs with different flow parameters. We obtain that the LV downturns when rising the MHN number. The LT enhances for enriching the heat consumption/generation parameter. The LC becomes small for larger quantity of chemical reaction and solutal stratification parameters.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Solid Mechanics']"

Stent contains a drug that is slowly released into the wall to prevent restenosis. The rug is highly reactive and a stent is protruding towards the lumen region. In the problem, a stent having a strut, porous wall, and a coating is placed in the arterial wall. The drug will be released from the strut into the arterial wall through mainly diffusion and convection due to tissue fluid. The arterial wall is assumed to be a fluid-filled porous region. In the problem, the physical configuration is considered as two regions, where region 1 refers to stent and transport is by diffusion and region 2 is porous where transport is by diffusion and convection. The diffusion coefficient is considered to be a function of concentration, hence the governing equations are nonlinear and not directly solvable. A method of regular perturbation technique is adopted and analytical solution is obtained for concentration in region 1 that is in the stent region and region 2 which is a porous wall. The drug fraction left in the wall is also evaluated and it indicates that the drug is retained at the wall for a long time.

Amongst the options worth investigating (for reducing costs), designing for (enhanced) reliability has still not gained traction, as implicitly considered a power-/energy-hungry solution (due to redundancy), as well as a complex design alternative (hence risky). From the biological side, neurons are prime examples of highly efficient designs reaching outstanding communication and computation reliabilities, although relying on random devices (known as ion channels or, more fittingly, single ion transistors). In this paper, bridging from biology to circuits, we will show how kind of overlooked mathematical results (about consecutive systems) together with novel Binet-equivalent formulas (for Fibonnaci numbers of higher orders) can be pieced together for completely avoiding reliability calculations for consecutive systems.

Analysis for deflection in thin plate structures is generally done with the help of Kirchhoff’s plate theory, also known as classical plate theory. Kirchhoff’s plate theory helps in developing a fourth-order partial deflection equation relating the deflection of a plate to the loading condition on the plate and the material or bending rigidity of the plate. The present study focuses on the analysis of a simply supported thin concrete plate that is subject to uniform loading over the entire plate area. The deflection surface of the plate is developed using Navier’s double trigonometric Fourier series. Regression analysis is done to understand how various plate parameters like material rigidity, loading on the plate, and area of the plate could affect the magnitude of deflection of the plate. Also, the effect of the mentioned plate parameters on the magnitude of bending moments, twisting moments, and shear forces acting on the plate is studied. Regression modelling is used to achieve the same. Statistical metrics like R-squared error, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are used to check the efficiency of regression analysis.

The maximal stresses are concentrated around the contact spot between the interacting ball piston and the cylindrical running track. The magnitude of the contact pressure largely dictates the strength of the pistons. The small initial gap determines the contact spot’s shape and the contact pressure distribution.

In contrast to fuzzy set theory, hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs) are more versatile and comprehensive tools for the representation of attribute values, whereas aggregation operators (AOs) are considered effective tools for the purpose of aggregation in fuzzy set theory. The existence of an aggregation operator (AO) which is capable of providing the necessary generality and versatility in altering perceptions of risk when aggregating attribute data under HFSs has not yet been disclosed. In spite of the fact that weighted AOs were invented earlier in order to attempt to fulfill the above-mentioned scenarios, they are still based on algebraic, Einstein, Hamacher, and Dombi operations. Thus, the primary objective of this study is to construct some comprehensive and adaptable AOs that may be used to address MADM issues with hesitant fuzzy (HF) data. This viewpoint allows us to begin by constructing new operations between HF elements that are based on generalized Dombi (GD) operations. Following that, we construct HF-GD weighted averaging and geometric AOs along with their ordered forms. We will discuss the effectiveness of several of the suggested AOs.

Infectious transfer is determined by chance. The model is extended to incorporate various lockdown scenarios. Simulations with different lockdowns are provided. In addition, under logistic regression, the probability of death as a function of age and gender is estimated, as well as the duration of the disease given that an individual dies from it.

The effect of inclined magnetic and electric fields on the growth rate of instability is studied in terms of non-dimensional parameters like the Darcy number, Electric and Magnetic parameters. It is observed that the inclined magnetic field has a stabilizing impact when the angle of orientation is $$90^{\circ }$$ 90 ∘ and whereas the horizontal magnetic field with a zero angle of inclination has a neutral impact on the stability of the system.

The system of partial differential equations governing the flow is reduced to a set of ODEs using suitable approximation and then solved by perturbation technique. We derived closed-form expressions for dimensionless velocity, temperature, and concentration field. Impacts of the variables reflecting the salient features of physical quantities on flow characteristics are presented graphically. It is noted that increasing heat source leads to enhancement of velocity and temperature of the fluid. Fluid concentration is increased with an increase of thermal parameters. Pressure rise gets enhanced with increasing chemical reaction while mixed behavior (increasing or decreasing) can be seen when magnetic parameter is increased. Also, permeability parameter tends to increase shear stress whereas mean half width of the channel and yield stress produces the opposite effect.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Solid Mechanics']"

Accounts of results produced from reinvigorated attention to the measurement, management, and improvement of the outcomes of health care show that much has been learned, and much remains to be done. This article proposes that causes of the failure to replicate in health care the benefits of “lean” methods lie in persistent inattention to measurement fundamentals. These fundamentals must extend beyond mathematical and technical issues to the social, economic, and political processes involved in constituting trustworthy performance measurement systems. Successful “lean” implementations will follow only when duly diligent investments in these fundamentals are undertaken. Absent those investments, average people will not be able to leverage brilliant processes to produce exceptional outcomes, and we will remain stuck with broken processes in which even brilliant people can produce only flawed results. The methodological shift in policy and practice prescribed by the authors of the chapters in this book moves away from prioritizing the objectivity of data in centrally planned and executed statistical modeling, and toward scientific models that prioritize the objectivity of substantive and invariant unit quantities. The chapters in this book describe scientific modeling’s bottom-up, emergent and evolving standards for mass customized comparability. Though the technical aspects of the scientific modeling perspective are well established in health care outcomes measurement, operationalization of the social, economic, and political aspects required for creating new degrees of trust in health care institutions remains at a nascent stage of development.

It has always been of interest to biologists to decipher the mechanism of echolocation. There are two groups among these flying mammals old-world fruit bats which do not echolocate and new-world bats which echolocate except a few like Rousettus spp . which is an echolocating fruit bat. The new world fruit bats are smaller in size and are called microbats. They are insectivores and need to catch prey in flight in dark conditions. To perform this task for foraging, they use echolocation. High-pitched sound waves are produced by bats that hit the target and come back to them. These frequency-modulated calls from bats help them in homing their prey. However, the mathematical expression of this mechanism, developed in 2010 by Xin-She Yang is even more interesting. By simply using velocity, frequency, iteration, and loudness, he explained how bats perform homing to catch their prey. The bat echolocation-inspired BAT algorithm is an iconic hallmark of nature-inspired computing. It is a heuristic model for solving problems. New variants have been developed and used for solving problems of diverse nature.

In the estimation process, the parameters of a given system are formulated into an optimization problem. One of the most interesting estimation problems relies on fractional-order systems. Where functional parameters and fractional orders parameters of the chaotic system are considered as decision variables in an optimization perspective. For this scenario, the complexity of fractional-order chaotic systems tends to construct error functions within a multimodal fashion. Many algorithms based on the principles of evolutionary computation have been developed to be applied to determine the parameters of a given fractional-order chaotic system. Nonetheless, most of them hold a crucial boundary, they repeatedly acquire local optimal values as outcomes, as a consequence of an improper balance among the evolutionary exploration stage and exploitation stage. This chapter introduces an evolutionary approach to estimating the parameter values of fractional-order chaotic systems.

Physical imperfections, model flaws and system complexities can all be sources of uncertainty. In addition, the action loads (live, wind and earthquake) applied to a structure during its lifetime are not deterministic, hence for the proper performance assessment of the structural system, it is essential to properly account for these uncertainties. Uncertainties are usually described by probabilistic and non-probabilistic approaches. The growing interest in the non-probabilistic approach developed due to the incredibility of the probabilistic approach when data is insufficient. For estimating the ranges of the structural system’s response, the interval finite element approach looks to be acceptable, whose input parameters are defined in the ranges. However, the range of values predicted by the interval analysis suffers dependency problem. This can cause the computed findings to be overestimated. Although, the use of numerical truncation technique, parameterization of intervals and subinterval technique suggested by several researchers to avoid the dependency problem caused by general interval arithmetic. The physical rules (distributive law) are not violated by a universal grey numbers are a form of grey number and predict accurate results when compared with the interval approach.

FLPs defined on graphs are very general and broadly applicable. Two such fundamental FLPs are the Vertex K -Center (VKC) and the Vertex K -Median (VKM) problems. Although both these problems are NP-hard, many heuristic and approximation algorithms have been developed for solving them in practice. However, state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms require the input graph G to be complete, in which the edge joining two vertices is also the shortest path between them. When G doesn’t satisfy this property, these heuristic algorithms have to be invoked only after computing the metric closure of G , which in turn requires the computation of all-pairs shortest-path (APSP) distances. Existing APSP algorithms, such as the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, have a poor time complexity, making APSP computations a bottleneck for deploying the heuristic algorithms on large VKC and VKM instances. To remedy this, we propose the use of a novel algorithmic pipeline based on a graph embedding algorithm called FastMap. FastMap is a near-linear-time algorithm that embeds the vertices of G in a Euclidean space while approximately preserving the shortest-path distances as Euclidean distances for all pairs of vertices. The FastMap embedding can be used to circumvent the barrier of APSP computations, creating a very efficient pipeline for solving FLPs. On the empirical front, we provide test results that demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our novel approach.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In this case, it is possible to model the operation of such a system as a sequence of operations developing in the form of a Markov random process and apply the mathematical apparatus of the theory of random processes to study the effectiveness of its operation. It is shown how the constructed mathematical model makes it possible to predict costs and profits in the process of functioning of the system, on the basis of which the optimal decision can be made.

Investigation of the solutions of the obtained equation in the linearized case made it possible to reveal the universality of the proposed equation and obtain very delicate results showing the connection between the wave dynamics of an incompressible fluid and the propagation of electrostatic waves in an electron plasma, namely, to find an analogue of Landau damping in plasma in a vortex fluid. A new dispersion relation is obtained for long waves in a vortex liquid, which generalizes the dispersion relation of a plasma with a self-consistent field to the case of a liquid with a free surface.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

To study mechanical properties, e.g., density, a small cuboidal core of the material is extracted from a large volume for further analyses. Due to the cutting edges, material particles may not belong completely to the core volume. This gives rice to a new class of packing problems where the standard containment conditions (all particles are entirely in the container) are substituted by a relaxed containment (all centers of the particles are in the container). A 2D version of this non-standard problem is presented and formulated as a nonlinear programming problem considering non-overlapping and relaxed containment constraints. A new solution technique is proposed combining a fast algorithm for generating feasible starting points and a local optimization procedure based on nonlinear programming.

A comprehensive literature review is carried out to observe the current applications of VEM for two-dimensional structural problems. However, it is observed that the current applications do not focus specifically on the importance of the stability parameter of the VEM. Therefore, this research is focused to study the effects of the stability parameter on the robustness and the stability of the VEM developing a general-purpose VEM code for analysis of the plane stress/plane strain problems. For this purpose, simple shaped polygons are proposed as the discretized element since they fully utilize the importance of VEM. Four case studies are carried out to compare the results obtained from the VEM and the FEM with the exact solution. Analytical results show that the stability parameter of the VEM can be categorized into three regions, and it is very much sensitive to the aspect ratio. This study proposes an equation to estimate the stability parameter as a function of aspect ratio to obtain more accurate results than the standard FEM results. Furthermore, this study concludes that VEM can be effectively used to model the structure using the non-convex element.","['Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Sustainable Development', 'Building Materials', 'Building Construction and Design']"

The design of such units provides for the preparation of the most detailed design scheme and the corresponding mathematical model. Simplified models of the interaction between the shaft and the bearing, between which there is a gap, are proposed for discussion. A design diagram has been drawn up that describes the main forces acting on the end of the shaft inside the bearing. The mode of motion of the shaft is described when its contact with the bearing is maintained for some time, i.e. the shaft is pressed against the bearing. A comparison is made of the modes of shaft movement with absolutely rigid and elastic bearings. A mathematical model of the motion of the shaft, in which it does not have contact with the bearing, is proposed. The resulting system of equations is solved numerically. An algorithm for constructing the movement of the shaft with separation from the bearing is described. The case is considered when the shaft is unbalanced, i.e. its center of inertia does not coincide with the center of rotation.

This flexibility in decision process can also be efficiently incorporated using fuzzy technique to solve GDNPP, which is achieved by introducing new constraints as per requirement of the problem. Moreover, these constraints could be so chosen that the highest possible number of objectives could attain their ideal values. This is a new type of flexibility introduced in the decision process.

This chapter scrutinizes the top academic performance attained by Taiwanese students by reviewing the national intended curriculum and guidelines, implemented teacher education and instruction, established textbook policies, and effects of national entrance examinations based on the Tri-Partite model. Intended curriculum defines what students should learn in schools at the country level; implemented curriculum refers to how and with what tools teachers instruct; attained curriculum is what students achieve. How the intended, implemented, and attained curricula interact to result in top performances for Taiwanese students among the education systems participating in international large-scale assessments is explained in detail. The traditional emphasis on the attained curriculum in Taiwan’s society seems to enhance Taiwanese students’ academic performance by ensuring they acquire basic skills and content knowledge in subject domains and related learning areas. Nonetheless, the need for modern citizens with high-level cognitive reasoning, autonomous problem-solving skills, modern digital learning abilities, and elevated well-being calls for advanced educational policies and practices in Taiwan. Investing educational resources in disadvantaged populations would ameliorate the serious achievement gap observed in Taiwan and thus strike a balance between equity and excellence. Along with the 12-Year Basic Education, Taiwan integrates the three parts of the curriculum to maintain its students’ top academic performance while aiming to reduce the achievement gap and improve educational equity.

On the one side, we generalize this problem by allowing the faces, which are adjacent to polygon line-segments, to be skew; i.e. to be non-planar. But on the other side, we restrict to the case where the four angles associated with each polygon vertex fulfill the so-called isogonality condition that both pairs of opposite angles are equal or supplementary. In more detail, we study the case where the polygonal line is a skew quad, as this corresponds to a $$(3\times 3)$$ ( 3 × 3 ) building block of a so-called V-hedra composed of skew quads.

Various factors, such as the testing environment, testing strategy, and resource allocation, can influence the optimal release time. The choice of whether or not to release a software product would become much more complicated and significant. When a software developer, clients, or end-users face significant potential financial losses, a decision has strategic significance. A software release decision is a trade-off between early release to take advantage of an earlier market launch and product release deferral to ensure reliability. If a software product is released too soon, the software developer must pay for post-release costs to correct bugs. To decide the best software release time, two attributes, reliability and cost, must be combined. This study discusses a realistic approach to determining when to stop software testing that considers reliability and cost.

The last one was solved with the method based on matrix differential calculations which was successfully applied earlier to solve the analogous static problem [ 1 , 2 ]. As a result, the non-homogeneous one-dimensional boundary problem was derived and solved with the help of Green’s matrix-function apparatus [ 3 ]. The wave field is constructed as a superposition of the homogeneous and non-homogeneous solutions and contains the unknown derivative of the displacements. To find this unknown displacement the singular integral equation is derived and solved with the help of the orthogonal polynomial method.

However, the DD model is of limited physical accuracy for nanoscale devices and hot carrier effects. Advanced physical modeling in the regime of semi-classical transport must therefore be based on the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), and the typical solution method for this equation is a Monte-Carlo (MC) algorithm owing to its small memory requirements. Unfortunately, this popular solution method makes the BTE model much less versatile than the DD approach, as, for example, no AC and noise analysis in the small-signal framework based on the Jacobian of the numerical model is available if the MC method is used. Moreover, evaluating the complete transport of carriers in a device by the BTE model is always several orders of magnitude less efficient in terms of CPU time than the application of the DD model. Thus, there is a clear demand to increase the versatility of the BTE model and to enhance the physical accuracy of the DD model without compromising its numerical efficiency and robustness. Solving the BTE model with the spherical harmonic expansion (SHE) method allows the calculation of the full Jacobian of the discrete system and to establish AC and noise analysis in the small-signal framework, thus making the BTE model much more versatile. Moreover, sequential and concurrent multi-scale methods using microscopic models such as the BTE model where necessary and macroscopic models such as the DD model otherwise are well suited to enhancing the physical accuracy of the DD model without compromising its efficiency and robustness. In addition, using the SHE method allows many of the discretization methods and principles previously developed for the DD model to be applied for the discretization of the BTE model. Therefore, a short overview of the historic development of discretization methods and principles, finally making the DD model as efficient and robust as it is today, is added as well.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Electronic Circuits and Devices', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation']"

They are supposed to be very important, but it is not always clear what they are or why you need them. Using ideas from Chaps. 1 and 2 , we describe them as local theories that are custom-designed for your study. Although they might use parts of larger well-known theories, they are created by individual researchers for particular studies. They are developed through the cyclic process of creating more precise and meaningful hypotheses. Building directly on constructs from the previous chapters, you can think of theoretical frameworks as equivalent to the most compelling, complete rationales you can develop for the predictions you make. Theoretical frameworks are important because they do lots of work for you. They incorporate the literature into your rationale, they explain why your study matters, they suggest how you can best test your predictions, and they help you interpret what you find. Your theoretical framework creates an essential coherence for your study and for the paper you are writing to report the study.","['Education', 'Research Methods in Education', 'Research Skills', 'Mathematics Education']"

This work fulfills two objectives. The first part of our research is concerned with the discrete-time generalized a system which reformulate from the discrete-time descriptor system by changing the structure of the system. Then the periodic matrix pairs are computed from the generalized inverse matrices, and the reformulated system is represented by a cyclic lifted structure. Smith method is exploited to find the iterative solutions of the associated Lyapunov equations of the cyclic lifted system. The original periodic system is contained in the solutions of the periodic Lyapunov equations. The periodic system is then reduced by using projectors computed from those periodic solutions. The above procedures are applied to reduce an artificial problem of the index-2 periodic structure. To verify the accuracy and performance of the algorithm, we have demonstrated the results obtained from numerical simulations.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

To study the effect of inertia weight, and based on different values of inertia weight used in the lectures (0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, and 1.3).

One of the primary challenges that instructors face is regarding the introduction of important theory to students, both to show its essential nature to the field as well as its practicality. This paper analyzes two pedagogical methods for the instruction of normal forms in database management systems, a mandatory topic in any database course. The first of these methods is a theory-based approach that relies on written works (i.e., theory) to introduce the concept. The second of these focuses on a practice-based approach (i.e., practice) which aligns with the normal form as students implement a database schema. Through a small study, it was determined that most students have a strong predisposition to theory-first education, though students seemed to prefer the practice-based approach more than the theory-first approach. This paper compares the two methodologies, given this insight, and advises the use of an appropriate method for future educators.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

They are mainly characterised by the presence of co-existing attractors in their dynamic response. This feature can be beneficial when the system is required to adapt to the environment or unfavourable as the system may diverge from the desired behaviour. Hence, these systems usually require actuation or control that can be activated to maintain the desired response or switch between configurations. Recently, the idea to use the time-delayed feedback method to switch between co-existent attractors was proposed focusing on the controlled system’s ability to exchange between attractors or maintain a specific type of behaviour. However, the control method is still required to have its gains set on a trial and error basis when dealing with stable solutions. Furthermore, it requires a deeper analysis of the system dynamics when dealing with unstable orbits. To address the beforementioned challenges and eliminate requirements of a priori knowledge of the system evolution function, this work uses the adaptive gain time-delayed feedback method to switch between co-existing attractors. Numerical results show that the proposed controller can be a viable low energy control option in multi-stable systems.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis']"

En passant an apparent gap in a former paper is eliminated by exploiting an old proof concerning (conditionally) positive definite kernels. In addition an explicit isometric embedding of the modified Bregman Divergence in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space is described. On a practical level recalling some basic facts on normal mixtures the well known connection between the parameter estimation problem for these mixtures and clustering algorithms is shown to hold in this abstract setting as well thus providing a more flexible approach to maximum likelihood estimates.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Note that in this case Zadeh’s compositional rule of inference (CRI) is used as an inference mechanism. As an alternative characterization in terms of analogical reasoning, we have that an input fuzzy set is compared with the antecedents of the rules in terms of Zadeh’s consistency index. Recently, there have been numerous proposals to replace Zadeh’s consistency index by similarity measures and overlap indices. Cornelis and Kerre previously presented a promising approach toward analogical reasoning that is based on the fuzzification of set inclusion and analyzed its properties such as monotonicity, compatibility with modus ponens, coherence and consistency. Other fuzzy extensions of set inclusion are given by Kaburlasos’ et al.’s inclusion measure approaches. The latter are related to subsethood measures that can be defined on arbitrary bounded lattices such as the class of closed subintervals of $$[0, 1]^n$$ [ 0 , 1 ] n . In this paper, we introduce a bounded lattice consisting of the empty set and the fuzzy sets on a closed interval whose $$\alpha $$ α -cuts are closed and whose membership functions (MFs) are continuous. Then we define specific types of subsethood measures on this bounded lattice. These subsethood measures are then used in analogical reasoning schemes for fuzzy rule-based systems.

To efficiently improve the reliability, the real-time anomaly behavior detection and efficient location identification of multiple line outages play a major role in wide area monitoring of smart grids. However, capturing the features of anomalous interruption and then detecting them at real time is difficult for large-scale smart grids, because the measurement data volume and complexity increase drastically with the exponential growth of data from the immense intelligent monitoring devices to be rolled out. This is especially true for multiple line outage detection, as the methods of identifying the locations of multiple line outages face two major challenges: a limited number of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and the high computational complexity. This chapter proposes an efficient real-time anomaly detection (ReTAD) algorithm to address these challenges, inspired in part by the ambiguity group theory. To characterize the performance of line outage identification, this chapter also introduces a statistical model to describe the average identification capability of multiple line outages. Under this model, we develop a global optimal PMUs placement strategy to maximize the average identification capability for a fixed budget of PMUs. Using 14-, 30-, 57-, 118- and 2383-bus systems, our experimental study demonstrates that our proposed ReTAD algorithm successfully detects the anomalous events in real-time and identifies the most likely multiple line outages with a $$500\times $$ 500 × speedup when compared to the method of exhaustive search. For the IEEE 14- and 57-bus systems, our experimental study also demonstrates that the proposed techniques can select optimal PMU locations while improving the average identification capability by about $$10\%$$ 10 % compared to random PMUs placement method.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Mathematical Modeling and Industrial Mathematics', 'Risk Management', 'Industrial Organization']"

Although conventional approaches to improving teaching quality for disadvantaged populations have overall been unsuccessful in China (i.e., student relocation to better-resourced urban schools, attracting high-quality teachers to low-resource rural schools, and rural teacher training), technology-assisted instruction may play a role in bridging these gaps. This paper explores why conventional approaches to improving teaching have not been effective in rural China and then describes the potential applications of technology-assisted instruction based on the small but growing body of empirical literature evaluating such interventions in other low- and middle-income countries. The paper concludes that while other (non-tech) interventions have thus far been ineffective at raising teaching quality, China may be uniquely positioned to harness technology-assisted instruction due to a favorable ecosystem for the scaling of EdTech in rural areas, though much more experimental research is necessary to assess which approaches and technologies are most cost-effective and how to best scale them.","['Economics', 'Agricultural Economics', 'Development Economics', 'Development Studies', 'Agriculture']"

The solution pool of the original VP is based on an additive formulation and, consequently, is not invariant in the diffeomorphic Lie algebra. The original VP works well when the prescribed pair of JD and curl is calculated from a diffeomorphism, but not necessarily when the prescribed JD and curl are unknown to come from a diffeomorphism. In spite of that, the original VP works effectively in 2D grid generations. To resolve this issue, in this paper, we describe a new version of VP (revised VP), which is based on the composition of transformations and, therefore, is invariant in the Lie algebra. The revised VP seems to have overcome the inaccuracy of the original VP in 3D grid generations. In the following sections, the mathematical derivations are presented. It is shown that the revised VP can calculate the inverse transformation of a known diffeomorphism. Its inverse consistency and transitivity of transformations are also demonstrated numerically. Finally, a new definition of averaging diffeomorphisms based on the revised VP is proposed.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Computational Intelligence']"

As a result, the research aims to compare six numerical method combinations used in the CHIMERE model. Preliminary air quality modeling results have revealed a discrepancy between the model and ozone observations, which is more likely due to the accuracy of the input data, such as emissions, meteorology, or land use data. The fastest combination, adv00 (Upwind-Upwind), on the other hand, provides a significant improvement, especially when a high spatial resolution is used, as in this study.

This setting requires finding the optimal composition of riders and pick-up and drop-off meeting points, as well as an equitable distribution of the costs whereby riders are incentivised to participate. Based on game-theoretic principles, we propose a methodology to determine the optimal pick-up and drop-off points, together with a cost allocation method that is equitable in the sense that it ensures proportionality for sharing the costs, i.e., those who walk more should pay less. We present a formal evaluation of our cost allocation method and empirical evaluation against the Shapley value using real-world and simulated data.

Furthermore, it is pointed out that some mathematical incorrect assumptions are considered in the above-mentioned approach. Therefore, it is inappropriate to use this approach to solve the proposed mathematical models as well as the third existing mathematical model. To propose an appropriate approach for solving the proposed mathematical models as well as the third existing mathematical model is a challenging open research problem.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Optimization', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory']"

In order to solve the FINV model accurately, The Lagrange and cubic Hermite functions are used to discretize the governing equations, and the incremental form of Newmark and Newton-Raphson are used to solve the FINV model of tubing string. A similar experiment of tubing vibration is designed and completed to test the validity of the FINV model by comparing the frequency-domain and time-domain responses of the experiment with those from the proposed model. The analysis shows that the FINV model has good calculation accuracy and the vibration response law is basically consistent with the experimental results. Meanwhile, the vibration characteristics of the tubing string are analyzed by using the field well parameters in South China Sea, and the effectiveness of the proposed model is verified again. The research results can provide an effective theoretical analysis tool for FINV behavior of tubing string in 3H curved gas wells.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Plasma Physics', 'Applications of Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos Theory', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Complex Systems']"

Many resources feed this process, including reading what others have found about similar phenomena, talking with colleagues, conducting pilot studies, and writing drafts as you revise your thinking. Although you might think you cannot predict what you will find, it is always possible—with enough reading and conversations and pilot studies—to make some good guesses.

The performance of each algorithm was evaluated by means of the total tardiness and the execution time using instances of 40, 50, and 100 jobs extracted from the OR-Library. The Simulated Annealing algorithm was found to be the most efficient method, being the one that found the best solutions in comparison to Tabu Search, nonetheless, Tabu Search found the results in the shortest time. A difference approximated of twenty-four units between Simulated Annealing and Tabu search was found in the total tardiness value when a set of 125 instances were executed. On the other hand, Tabu Search required only the 13% of the time execution required by Simulated Annealing.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Computer Applications']"

Road traffic crashes are a disaster for humans. In terms of untimely deaths and injuries, it entails high human suffering and monetary costs. Road traffic crashes are controllable to corrective measures. It is, therefore, necessary to examine the causes of road traffic crashes and recommend corrective measures at a potential segment, particularly in developing countries such as India where road traffic crashes are prevalent and data on road crashes are scarce. The objective of this study is to identify risk factors related to the vehicle and the environment, that are associated with a road traffic crash on urban roads in India, based on police data records (FIR). Analyzing this basic but important data, when other geometric and land use information is missing, could help to determine the risk factors involved in road traffic crashes that are responsible for the fatal or non-fatal crash. For this study, crash data for the year 2014–2019 was collected from the Wardha City Police Department for seven road segments. A case–control study is conducted where the case is: a fatal road traffic crash; the control was a non-fatal crash. A case–control analysis is designed to assess whether exposure is related to an outcome. The risk analysis was calculated by the odds-ratio (OR) estimate, with a 95% confidence interval. Bicycles and pedestrians as victims, heavy motor vehicles as accused vehicle categories, and crossing types of vehicle maneuver were found to be major risk factors for fatal crashes, as were a few other statistically insignificant variables. Identifying factors related to the risk of being involved in a roadway traffic crash on a specific road segment aids us in recommending primary preventive measures and resolving this major threat to human health, particularly in the Indian context.","['Engineering', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Sustainable Development']"

Trip planner is a tool which helps commuters to plan their travel beforehand. In case of public transportation systems, trip with the minimum travel time is often of interest. A trip planner solves the time dependent shortest path problem (TDSPP) in a multimodal transport network to optimize one or more criteria like travel time, the number of transfers, etc. One subclass of this is the departure time planner. It suggests the optimal departure time from origin such that travel time to reach the destination will be minimum. This paper presents development of multimodal departure time planner using General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data. A citywide public transportation network is constructed with bus, metro and walking as modes of transport. Nodes represent transit stops and edges represent transportation services available in between nodes. The schedule corresponding to every mode is incorporated in the network. Origin, destination, and the latest arrival time at the destination for the trip are inputs from the user. A schedule-based algorithm is implemented which runs backward in time to calculate optimal labels at every node of the network. The results produced by the trip planner are found to be promising in terms of accuracy and feasibility.","['Engineering', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Sustainable Development']"

PSO initially proposed for continuous optimization and, to till, different discrete optimizations methods are developed adapting PSO in different time periods. The major concerns to solve discrete optimization task with PSO are the adaptation of particle encoding, velocity measurement and position update. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the evolution of PSO in solving discrete optimizations conceiving different adaptations in its operations. This study explains adaptation of PSO for four different discrete optimization problems: knapsack problem (KP), traveling salesman problem (TSP), vehicle routing problem (VRP), and university course scheduling problem (UCSP). The selected problems are well diverse having different constraints and objectives; KP seems a simplest one and UCSP is the most complex optimization task. The rhythmic presentation of PSO adaptation in solving KP, TSP, VRP and UCSP in this chapter may be a proper demonstration of PSO transformation from its original continuous domain to different discrete domains. The study will be made easy to understand other PSO-based discrete optimization methods as well as will be helpful to solve any new discrete optimization task adopting PSO.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

How this microscopic-macroscopic interaction occurs is poorly understood, as researchers frequently examine models within particular ranges of abstraction and scale. Computational neuroscience and machine learning models offer theoretically powerful analyses of plasticity in neural networks, but results are often siloed and only coarsely linked to biology. In this review, we examine connections between these areas, asking how network computations change as a function of diverse features of plasticity and vice versa. We review how plasticity can be controlled at synapses by calcium dynamics and neuromodulatory signals, the manifestation of these changes in networks, and their impacts in specialized circuits. We conclude that metaplasticity—defined broadly as the adaptive control of plasticity—forges connections across scales by governing what groups of synapses can and can’t learn about, when, and to what ends. The metaplasticity we discuss acts by co-opting Hebbian mechanisms, shifting network properties, and routing activity within and across brain systems. Asking how these operations can go awry should also be useful for understanding pathology, which we address in the context of autism, schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Psychiatry', 'Neurosciences', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Biological Psychology']"

This paper uses an agent-based cellular automata model to establish a micro-traffic simulation framework for urban roads, called the ABCA-MS model. Considering the characteristics of the intermittent flow of urban roads and signal light control, corresponding car-following and lane-changing rules are established and applied to simulate mixed traffic flow containing CAVs. The simulation results show that the traffic efficiency and the permeability of CAVs show a positive correlation; under the given traffic volume condition, the critical CAVs penetration rate for a traffic state change from congestion to unblocked is 0.4. When the penetration rate of CAVs is in the range of 0–0.4, the improvement of road traffic efficiency is the most significant, and the effect of improvement gradually slows down with the increase of CAVs penetration. Even with a low penetration rate of CAVS, the road capacity can be effectively improved, and the traffic pressure can be alleviated.","['Engineering', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

In the face of experimental discoveries, analytical formulations emerged as a powerful yet tractable tool in recent theoretical investigations of the role of LLPS in the assembly and dissociation of these condensates. The pertinent LLPS often involves, though not exclusively, intrinsically disordered proteins engaging in multivalent interactions that are governed by their amino acid sequences. For researchers interested in applying these theoretical methods, here we provide a practical guide to a set of computational techniques devised for extracting sequence-dependent LLPS properties from analytical formulations. The numerical procedures covered include those for the determination of spinodal and binodal phase boundaries from a general free energy function with examples based on the random phase approximation in polymer theory, construction of tie lines for multiple-component LLPS, and field-theoretic simulation of multiple-chain heteropolymeric systems using complex Langevin dynamics. Since a more accurate physical picture often requires comparing analytical theory against explicit-chain model predictions, a commonly utilized methodology for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of sequence-specific LLPS is also briefly outlined.","['Life Sciences', 'Biochemistry, general', 'Bioinformatics']"

One was proposed by von Neumann and the other one was introduced by Moore and Shannon. For computations the gate-level method of von Neumann was embraced, while another one at the device-level was crafted by Moore and Shannon laying the foundation of network reliability. This device-level scheme was also intended for enhancing the reliability of computations, but was kind of sidetracked and ended up being employed for communications. Since then, steady advances towards single digit nanometer transistors have been constant. Lately, advanced technologies are in high demand for supporting the growing computational needs on which AI is blooming (as well as IoT and G5). As advance CMOS are sensitive to variations, it seems normal to analyze networks for identifying optimal ones, and the Moore and Shannon concept is a perfect fit for transistors/devices built and organized as arrays: FinFET, MBCFET, GAAFET, etc. Still, defining optimality in this context is a non-trivial task, as the conflicting power consumption and reliability requirements need to be analyzed and optimized simultaneously. For a better understanding we decided to start performing very detailed simulations of $$3\,\times\,3$$ 3 × 3  resistor/transistor networks including variations (relying on the free ASAP7 PDK). We are reporting and discussing a few of those simulations here. Their statistical processing will reveal subtle and unexpected links between classical Kirchhoff theorems (pertinent for power consumption) and Moore and Shannon reliability concepts (theoretical). Plenty of additional investigations will be needed. Still, the main conclusion (based on the preliminary simulations we shall present) is that identifying optimal networks for low-power reliable CMOS designs (for computations) is a complex but doable task.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Computational Intelligence']"

We have used three-stage modelling to allocate resources, which incorporates different efforts, i.e. detection effort, isolation effort, and removal effort. We have used the optimal control-theoretic approach to find the optimal policies by considering effort as a control parameter. We also discussed the variations in the future cost of the model by assuming that the cost of detection, isolation and removal follows the learning curve phenomenon. The theoretical results and optimal control theory-based optimized policy is supported by a numerical example.","['Mathematics', 'Mathematical Modeling and Industrial Mathematics', 'Risk Management', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing']"

The main aim of this study is to propose an alternative approach into how students are admitted into universities as opposed to the traditional APS system for admission. To achieve this, we use features like a student’s background, individual and pre-college information and make use of six off-the-shelf machine learning classifiers, namely random forest, the K-Star algorithm, naive Bayes, a multi-layer perceptron, the J-48 decision tree and logistic regression where we achieved accuracy of 95%, 93%, 78%, 91%, 88% and 92%, respectively. These models can then be used to facilitate student placement. We also illustrate a relationship between background, individual and pre-college attributes of a student to academic performance in this paper. We make use of a feature extraction technique (Principal Component Analysis (Philos Trans Roy Soc A: Math Phys Eng Sci 374(2065), 20150202 [ 15 ]) to select the optimal number of features to feed into our six predictive models. The traditional method of aggregation of high school marks to deem whether a student has the ability to pass a specific curriculum is rejected. We argue that a more student-centric system that looks at incorporating the students background, individual and pre-college attributes is needed in order to place the student in an academic program that will maximise the possibility of passing in minimum time.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Plethora of model selection criteria have been developed over the years by constructing estimators of discrepancy measures that assess the divergence between the true model and a fitted approximating model in terms of their probability mass functions or probability density functions. This contribution focuses on a model selection criterion for count models, which assess the divergence between the true model and a fitted approximating model in terms of probability generating functions. The proposed model selection criterion is appealing in cases where the likelihood of a model is not regular enough. An example is presented where the proposed model selection criterion can be applied, while ordinary ones, such as the Akaike Information Criterion, cannot. Finally, the performance of the proposed model selection criterion is evaluated and compared with the respective of the Akaike Information Criterion based on a Monte Carlo study in a case where both approaches can be applied.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Data Engineering', 'Statistics for Engineering, Physics, Computer Science, Chemistry and Earth Sciences', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Mathematical Applications in Computer Science']"

Various ways are available to ensure software optimization. One of the key indicators of software is its reliability. Software reliability refers to the program features to perform certain functions and they are kept within certain limits under specified conditions. Software reliability is determined by its non-denial and recoverability. Software reliability is considered an important quality factor. The article uses the VIKOR (VIsekriterijumska optimizacija i KOmpromisno Resenje) method for the development of an algorithm to increase software reliability. The VIKOR method is used for different areas. Some sources provide information on the application of the VIKOR method. It refers to a multi-criteria decision method or multi-criteria decision analysis method. The alternatives here are ranked and the one closest to the ideal so-called compromise is determined. As a result of the author's research, six important criteria for software reliability are identified and alternatives are used. The fuzzy VIKOR method is used for multi-criteria evaluation of software. The work done is considered to be novel, and the advantage is that the selected criteria have not yet been used for this type of task, this positively changes its efficiency.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-19467-2_3,en,Ocean Acidification and Sea Warming-Toward a Better Comprehension of Its Consequences,OriginalPaper,"Climate change, rigorously heralded more than thirty years ago as a real threat, has become the most pressing and pernicious global problem for the entire planet. In conjunction with local impacts such as fishing, eutrophication or the invasion of alien species, to give just a few examples, the acidification of the oceans and the warming of the sea began to show its effects more than twenty years ago. These signals were ignored at the time by the governing bodies and by the economic stakeholders, who now see how we must run to repair the huge inflicted damage. Today, different processes are accelerating, and the thermodynamic machine has definitely deteriorated. We see, for example, that the intensity and magnitude of hurricanes and typhoons has increased. Most models announce more devastation of flash floods and a decomposition in the water cycle, which are factors directly affecting ecosystems all over the world. Important advances are also observed in the forecasting of impacts of atmospheric phenomena in coastal areas with more and more accurate models. Rising temperatures and acidification already affect many organisms, impacting the entire food chain. All organisms, pelagic or benthic, will be affected directly or indirectly by climate change at all depths and in all the latitudes. The impact will be non-homogeneous. In certain areas it will be more drastic than in others, and the visualization of such impacts is already ongoing. Some things may be very evident, such as coral mortalities in tropical areas or in the surface waters of the Mediterranean, while others may be less visible, such as changes in microelement availability affecting plankton productivity. In fact, primary productivity in microalgae, macroalgae and phanerogams is already beginning to feel the impact of warmer, stratified and nutrient-poor waters in many parts of the planet. Nutrients are becoming less available, temperature is rising above certain tolerance limits and water movement (turbulence) may change in certain areas favoring certain species of microplankton instead of others. All these mechanisms, together with light availability (which, in principle, is not drastically changing except for the cloudiness), affect the growth of the organisms that can photosynthesize and produce oxygen and organic matter for the rest of the trophic chain. That shift in productivity completely changes the rest of the food chain. In the Arctic or Antarctic, the problem is slightly different. Life depends on the dynamics of ice that is subject to seasonal changes. But winter solidification and summer dissolution is undergoing profound changes, causing organisms that are adapted to that rhythm of ice change to be under pressure. The change is more evident in the North Pole, but is also visible in the South pole, where the sea ice cover has also dramatically changed. In the chapter there is also a mention about the general problem of the water currents and their profound change do greenhouse gas effects. The warming of the waters and their influence on the marine currents are also already affecting the different ocean habitats. The slowdown of certain processes is causing an acceleration in the deoxygenation of the deepest areas and therefore an impact on the fragile communities of cold corals that populate large areas of our planet. Many organisms will be affected in their dispersion and their ability to colonize new areas or maintain a connection between different populations. The rapid adaptations to these new changes are apparent. Nature is on its course of restart from these new changes, but in this transitional phase the complexity and interactions that have taken thousands or millions of years to form can fade away until a new normal is consolidated.","['Earth Sciences', 'Oceanography', 'Sustainable Development', 'Water, general', 'Environmental Health']"

The most commonly used predictor is the conditional expectation of the unknown value given the data, and its calculation is obtained from assumptions about the probability distribution of the process and the measurements of that process. The conditional expectation is unbiased and minimises the mean-squared prediction error, which can be interpreted as the unconditional risk based on the squared-error loss function. Cressie [ 4 , p. 108] generalised this approach to other loss functions, to obtain spatial predictors that are optimal (i.e., that minimise the unconditional risk) but not necessarily unbiased. This chapter is concerned with spatial prediction of processes that take non-negative values, for which there is a class of loss functions obtained by adapting the phi-divergence goodness-of-fit statistics [ 6 ]. The important sub-class of power-divergence loss functions is featured, from which a new class of spatial predictors can be defined by choosing the predictor that minimises the corresponding unconditional risk.

The elements are based on the SL Block system developed by Shen-Guan Shih. The work proposes strategies to assemble multiple SL blocks to form larger aggregations which subsequently turn into building elements on another scale. This approach allows reconsidering the resolution of architectural constructions. Building elements that have previously been considered as solid and monolithic can now be aggregated by many small SL-Blocks. Those dry-joint aggregations allow for easy disassembly and reassembly into different configurations and therefore contribute to a circular reuse of building elements. In order to facilitate such a permanent transformation, the research also includes first steps towards the autonomous assembly of building blocks through a robot including the planning for how to optimally place the parts, as well as ensuring feasible execution by the robot. The goal is a fully autonomous pipeline that takes as input a user-defined, desired shape, and the available building blocks, and directly maps to actions that are executable by the robot. As a result, the desired shape should be optimally resembled through the robot’s autonomous actions. The research therefore addresses handling the combinatorial search space regarding the possibilities to combine the available parts, incorporate the constraints of the robot, creating a feasible plan that ensures the stability of the structure at any point in the construction process, avoiding collisions between the robot and the structure, and in the case of SL-Blocks, trying to ensure that the overall structure is interlocking.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Statistics, general']"

Since in some situations it may be very useful to identify groups of these sets, a fuzzy clustering method has been proposed. It is a generalization of the well-know fuzzy k -means that takes into account the nature of the data through an appropriate distance measure. The adequacy of the proposal has been checked by means of a real application on the clasts in the Cantabrian Coast.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Reversible watermarking has been developed in advance of watermarking, whereby both of data quality and data recovery are guaranteed. For long time, the watermarking scheme to meet image, audio and video data type security was considered ever popular, but at the same time, since last several years ago relational database watermarking was really in mind and under study, even various watermarking approaches have been suggested. Nonetheless, these techniques yet are not sturdy enough against malignant attacks that can result in false insertion, modification or elimination leading to data performance and quality deterioration. So, and with aim of advancing and improving existing watermarking techniques, a new robust and reversible relational database watermarking method is suggested by which better outcomes were achieved.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security']"

We treat nodes of a graph as point-sized unit mass particles that interact with each other as well as the space (multi-dimensional) that they are present in through certain defined physical forces. As the configuration of the system evolves during the simulation, similar nodes coalesce while the dissimilar nodes separate out, thus allowing node clusters to emerge. We have experimented with this idea on graphs with up to 300 nodes and have found it to work well. Doing so also allowed us to solve problems of network community detection by utilizing existing density based clustering algorithms, which otherwise would not be possible.","['Mathematics', 'Mathematical Applications in Computer Science', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Mathematical Modeling and Industrial Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Optimization']"

The second natural frequency is known to be nonlinear in temperature, and this will serve as the main focal point of this work. Cointegration is a method of normalising time series data with respect to one another - often strongly-correlated time series. Cointegration is used in this paper to remove effects from Environmental and Operational Variations, by cointegrating the first four natural frequencies for the Z24 Bridge data. The temperature effects on the natural frequency data are clearly visible within the data, and it is desirable, for the purposes of structural health monitoring, that these effects are removed. The univariate time series are embedded in higher-dimensional space, such that interesting topologies are formed. Topological data analysis is used to analyse the raw time series, and the cointegrated equivalents. A standard topological data analysis pipeline is enacted, where simplicial complexes are constructed from the embedded point clouds. Topological properties are then calculated from the simplicial complexes; such as the persistent homology. The persistent homology is then analysed, to determine the topological structure of all the time series.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The cell problems are solved on a microstructure geometry of brain tissue with capillary embedded to obtain effective parametric tensors, namely the capillary and interstitial hydraulic conductivity ( $${\mathbf{K}}$$ K and $${\mathbf{G}}$$ G ), capillary and interstitial homogenous Biot’s coefficient ( $$\alpha_{c}$$ α c and $$\alpha_{t}$$ α t ), Young’s modulus ( E ) and Poisson’s ratio ( v ). By varying the tortuosity, the percentage difference of $${\mathbf{K}}$$ K is 97.98%, shows that it is highly affected by tortuosity. The percentage difference of $${\mathbf{G}}$$ G is 0.25% implying that tortuosity insignificantly affecting $${\mathbf{G}}$$ G . Meanwhile, $$\alpha_{c}$$ α c and $$\alpha_{t}$$ α t decreases and increases with tortuosity, respectively. The percentage difference of E and v are 0.14% and 0.03% respectively, implying that both parameters does not affected by tortuosity.

Using this classification and describing function approximation of their nonlinearities, we find that most variants of the Jerk-based systems only have self-excited attractors near their equilibrium points; yet for the case of three continuously connected linear sections with unstable equilibrium points, a set of newly discovered hidden attractors are identified.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Plasma Physics', 'Applications of Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos Theory', 'Mathematical and Computational Engineering', 'Complex Systems']"

The public sector, due to size, breadth of areas, and number of public entities it aggregates, is seen as an area of ​​opportunities, for the present and the future, some of which still unknown. The European Union has been a real driver of the implementation and use of AI in Public Administration, disclosing that in numerous documents, highlighting both the role of Public Administration and the relevance of ethical aspects in the development and use of AI in the public sector. Notwithstanding, the aforementioned documents signal public administrations in general have not yet achieved considerable improvements on the use of AI technologies. Because of opaque algorithms, AI lacks proper explanations of its decisions, so that the duty to justify its acts and the avoidance of discretionary power are not trampled on. Public Administration’s importance is paramount, for the amount of data it holds, and it contributes to system design with a different perspective than that of the private sector, privileging collective good over profit. Due to its overall purchasing power, it can be a vehicle for the dissemination of ethical AI in the private sector, through public procurement documents’ specifications. This article aims to contribute to interest in ethical AI research in Public Administration, an area whose studies have been scarce.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

First, it reviews the recent literature using incentivized measures of attitudes toward risk and competition to study the extent to which gender differences in these traits help explain gender differences in educational and career choices as well as earnings. Second, it reviews the experimental literature on gender differences in negotiations. Third, it concludes by discussing the recent experimental literature on gender discrimination, emphasizing beliefs about productivity as the mechanism leading to differential hiring of men and women. Experiments are a powerful tool to explain gender differences in labor markets as they create controlled environments where causal links can be derived and exact mechanisms can be identified.","['Economics', 'Labor Economics', 'Population Economics', 'Human Resource Management', 'Statistics for Business, Management, Economics, Finance, Insurance', 'Education Economics', 'Behavioral/Experimental Economics']"

The most important property of an intelligence metric must be its universality. Developing universal intelligence metrics is difficult based on the very large diversity of intelligent systems. A feasible approach for ensuring the universality of measuring machine intelligence consists in using black-box-based methods able to measure the central intelligence tendency in problem solving. This paper represents a guide for choosing the most appropriate black-box-based intelligence metric for measuring the intelligence of developed IABSs, classification of IABSs in intelligence classes and detection of the IABSs with statistical low and high outlier intelligence. In research where the performance of heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms is studied, the performance indicator is frequently calculated as the mean or the median of experimental evaluation results. There is no consensus agreement regarding which of them is more appropriate. In some cases, both of them are reported. The manner in which it should be decided which of them to be used is scientifically grounded in this paper.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

We performed an analysis of methods and tools, accessible to a scientific community, which showed significant problems of currently developed approaches. Some methods provide significant performance, sacrificing ease-of-use, others offer simple programming interface but suffer with performance drawbacks. To address both of these issues, we designed a domain-specific programming language with simple and yet powerful syntax and minimal amount of boilerplate code. The chose of the underlying infectious disease spread model is based on a growing interest in agent-based models, which are becoming more popular due to higher simulation accuracy compared to classical compartmental models. At its core, each agent has its personal user-defined daily schedule, which dictates where the agent is situated at each simulation step based on numerous parameters, such as simulation “day”, agent’s inner state, inner states of linked to this agent compartments, which can be, for example, its house, place of work, school, etc. The underlying language’s engine uses this schedule to check, which agent pair were in contact with each other and where at each simulation step. The infectious disease, defined by a set of rules, which control how do these contacts affect inner states of both agents and how disease progresses in context of a single infected agent. We designed a compiler with Python as intermediate language for a simple programming interface and Numba support for machine language translation. Performed tests showed, that the language is capable of describing complex epidemiological models and the compiler is able to generate machine code efficiently enough to run simulations with medium number of entities. The main problem of a developed approach is the quadratic nature of algorithmic complexity of a contact tracing transmission process. We left optimization of it as a topic for a future research.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

As the complexity of data has increased due to higher dimensions, diverse approaches have been successfully tested for nearest neighbor queries, clustering algorithms, etc. These algorithms have been optimized and adapted for CPU, GPU and hybrid models as combination of CPU and GPU. Closest pair (CP) computation is a frequently used operation in range and distance-based queries. Although there are different algorithms and optimizations available for CP computations, suitability of GPU for this operation is yet to be explored. Hereby in this paper we propose CPU-GPU Hybrid Model, to optimize the closest pair (CP) of points problem concerning two-dimensional floating point values. As part of the combined model, the sorting phase is implemented on CPU and computation of closest pair is implemented on GPU. In this work, three CP algorithms are analyzed on CPU and CPU-GPU combinations. With the proposed algorithm on the CPU-GPU combined model, up to 12 times speedup is achieved in the closest pair computation time.

Working with Markov kernels (regular conditional distributions) allows to construct the measure which assigns every copula a value in [0, 1], which is 0 exactly in the case of independence, and 1 exclusively for Y being a function of X . More importantly, given samples of X and Y and considering so-called checkerboard estimators it is possible to derive a strongly consistent estimator for the dependence measure which also exhibits a good performance for small and medium sample sizes. After sketching the background on the dependence measure and its checkerboard estimator, and illustrating its performance in terms of a small simulation study we discuss how the studied approach can be generalized to the multivariate question of quantifying the extent of dependence of a random variable Y on an ensemble of random variables.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This chapter presents an overview of engineering tools used for this purpose – including computer models of building fires, pollutant dispersion models and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) framework. The fire models can be used to determine the emission of a fire, as well as determine the safety related to smoke and heat exposure for the building occupants. A brief history of fire models is shown, together with a description of the concept of design fires. Dispersion models varying in complexity from simple box and Gaussian plume, to complex Eulerian grid and Lagrangian particle models, allow determining the smoke dispersion over large areas (far-field), including the wind effects on the pollutant distribution. In the case of the most advanced models, they include mesoscale meteorological models and sub-models for complex phenomena, e.g. chemical reactions between smoke particles and air, soot agglomeration and sedimentation. CFD method provides unmatched resolution in the near-field, allowing investigation of building wake and downwash effects on the smoke contamination. As CFD method is commonly used in fire modelling, expansion of the area of interest to building surroundings may result in a more in-depth overview of the consequences of building fires. The chapter provides an elaborate introduction to wind and fire coupled modelling, including tips for building and discretizing the numerical domain and the introduction of the wind into the numerical model. Literature examples of modelling wind and fire are presented. Furthermore, a case study is introduced, aiming at the determination of the consequences of a warehouse fire on its neighborhood.","['Engineering', 'Fire Science, Hazard Control, Building Safety', 'Environmental Health', 'Climate Change/Climate Change Impacts']"

However, when applied to systems with a square matrix, it is, in a sense, more convenient than the Gauss method. The authors of this work developed and proposed a method in which they tried to combine the advantages of the Cramer and Gauss methods. In this paper, the Cramer-Gauss method is adapted to solving systems of linear algebraic equations with three and five-diagonal coefficient matrices and reduced to a form convenient for computer processing. The justification for the relevance of the study is that the approximate solution of a large range of problems, in particular, in the theory of differential equations, is reduced to solving systems of linear algebraic equations with tridiagonal and five-diagonal coefficient matrices.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Its role is to derive an analytic estimation of the outputs expected for given inputs based on observed input-output data. The objective function that is optimized within the regression model is generally the representation of the approximation error comparing to the observed data. Nowadays, the uncertainty is commonly taken into consideration when modeling real systems, and vectorizing information is an important aspect of addressing big data in computer science. Consequently, finding pertinent fuzzy regression models is of great importance within mathematical modeling. In this paper we report our findings related to the full use of the extension principle in solving the optimization model comprised in a least square fuzzy linear regression methodology. We propose a solution approach based on mathematical programming to estimate the fuzzy outputs of the observed fuzzy data; and group our experiments in two categories with respect to the crispness of the observed input data. The first category uses crisp input data and is considered to better explain the advantage of using the extension principle within the solution approach; while the second category, having fuzzy both input and output observed data, is included to prove the relevance of the new approach compared to methodologies from the recent literature.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Computational Intelligence']"

Optimization algorithms are preferred over other methods of optimization through experimentation or simulation, for their generic problem-solving abilities and promising efficacy with the least human intervention. In recent times, the inducement of natural phenomena into algorithm design has immensely triggered the efficiency of optimization process for even complex multi-dimensional, non-continuous, non-differentiable and noisy problem search spaces. This chapter deals with the Swarm intelligence (SI) based algorithms or Swarm Optimization Algorithms, which are a subset of the greater Nature Inspired Optimization Algorithms (NIOAs).

Their added value compared to hydrographic parameters (e.g., temperature and salinity) relies either on their known rates of radioactive decay and production or on their time-variable releases from sources. Both aspects introduce a temporal dimension that allows quantifying rates or time scales of marine processes. Their wide range of half-lives and historical inputs, together with their physicochemical characteristics allow tracing a broad spectrum of marine processes. This chapter aims at providing an overview of the application of radionuclides as tracers of ocean processes. The chapter is structured in four sections: The first part reviews the main principles of radioactivity and the origin of radionuclides. The second section introduces the key aspects that allow using radionuclides as ocean tracers, followed by (third section) three real and contemporary instructive examples that cover different marine processes and require radionuclides with specific properties: i) thorium-234/uranium-238 ( 234 Th/ 238 U) pair to quantify the biological pump, ii) radium (Ra) isotopes to estimate the magnitude of submarine groundwater discharge, and iii) iodine-129 ( 129 I) to investigate the large-scale ocean circulation.

In this paper, we provide three possible explanations for this surprising fact. First, we show that several formulas from quantum physics actually provide a good first-approximation description for many phenomena in general, not only to the phenomena of micro-physics. Second, we show that some quantum formulas represent the fastest way to compute nonlinear dependencies and thus, naturally appear when we look for easily computable models; in this aspect, there is a very strong similarity between quantum techniques and neural networks. Third, due to numerous practical applications of micro-phenomena, many problems related to quantum equations have been solved; so, when we use quantum techniques to describe social phenomena, we can utilize the numerous existing solutions—which would not have been the case if we use other nonlinear techniques for which not many solutions are known. All this provides an explanation of why quantum techniques work reasonably well in economics. However, of course, economics is different from quantum world, quantum equations only provide a first approximation to economic situations. In this paper, we use the ideas behind our explanations to speculate on what should be the next—not-exactly-quantum—approximation to social and economic phenomena.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This issue was addressed by Devidas et al. [ 12 ] with a static decentralized group signature scheme(DGSS) by decentralizing the group manager. However, the limitation of DGSS is that it works only for static domains, where group members are fixed and will not allow new members to join and existing members to leave the network. In this paper, DGSS is extended to propose a dynamic decentralized group signature scheme which allows the group members to join and revoke at run-time. The performance of Devidas et al.

This has implications for predicting how newly synthesized compounds will affect a person’s metabolism and, hence, the development of novel treatments to improve one’s health. The study of metabolomic pathways, together with protein engineering, may also aid in the extraction, at a scale, of natural products to be used as drugs and drug precursors. Several approaches have been used to correlate protein annotations to metabolic pathways in order to derive pathways directly related to specific organisms. These could range from association rule-mining techniques to machine learning methods such as decision trees, naïve Bayes, logistic regression, and ensemble methods. In this chapter, we will be reviewing the use of machine learning for metabolic pathway analyses, with a step-by-step focus on the use of deep learning to predict the association of compounds (metabolites) to their respective metabolomic pathway classes. This prediction could help explain interactions of small molecules in organisms. Inspired by the work of Baranwal et al.

We considered two different types of fingerprints as features (inputs to the model). The output of the model is the set of metabolic pathway classes (from the KEGG dataset) in which the input molecule participates.

To study the dynamic response of the planetary gear system with gear fault, a nonlinear dynamic model for both health system and faulty system containing the backlash, time-varying mesh stiffness and manufacturing error is put forward. Then, the backlash and rotation frequency are taken as the excitation parameters to study the nonlinear characteristics of the faulty and healthy system through the global bifurcation diagram. At the same time, the local characteristics of the two systems are analyzed via the Poincaré maps and phase diagrams. The analysis results show that the faulty system has a more complex movement as the excitation parameters variation.

Typically, this analysis includes finding the stationary points or limit cycles, determining their stability or instability, and identifying the regions of attraction (RoAs) of attractors. There are several classical methods for obtaining RoAs estimates, which may be divided into Lyapunov and non-Lyapunov methods; at the same time, due to the limitations of existing methods, the identification of a complex RoAs boundary is practically impossible, and it also leads to a high computational cost. The existing methods are quite effective for systems of the second and third orders. However, an increase in the dimension of the system or uncertain mechanical parameters leads to an exponential increase in the required calculations. In this regard, it is essential to design relatively simple algorithms in terms of the number of necessary operations and, at the same time, give acceptable from a practical point of view estimates of RoAs. The present paper deals with the problem of obtaining estimates of the domains of attraction and stability for a nonlinear dynamical system with a polynomial right-hand side. It is based on a particular procedure of polynomial Lyapunov function construction. As an example, this procedure is applied to estimate the domain of attraction for the mechanical system of two coupled oscillators.","['Engineering', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Engineering Design', 'Materials Engineering']"

We have developed a Finite Element Model Updating (FEMU) approach to determine the individual nonlinear and anisotropic constitutive behavior of healthy and diseased human aortae in vivo based on 4D ultrasound data, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, only. In an in vitro study by our group, the 95% confidence interval of the random error of local strain measurement by 4D ultrasound was determined to be ±2.1%. The uncertainty of the mean of the local strains was slightly smaller (± 1.6%). However, the random error of the mean in repeated measurements is the possible systematic error of local strain values in a single measurement. The uniqueness of the parameter identification and the effect of the measurement uncertainty on the identified constitutive behavior were examined in numerical experiments. The results indicate that the solution of the inverse problem is unique with regard to the identified stretch- Cauchy stress curves (R 2  ≥ 0.978), but non-unique with regard to the parameters of the constitutive equation. These results were confirmed by parameter identification based on strain field data with overlaid random error (R 2  ≥ 0.912). In contrast, a systematic error of the mean strain (+1.6%) resulted in the identification of a decisively softer material. The numerical verification shows that it is feasible to identify the constitutive behavior of the geometrically irregular aortic wall based on just two load-cases if heterogeneous strain fields are available.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Machine Learning', 'Bioinformatics']"

A large number of solid waste treatment options are available for decision-makers to choose from however the selection of an appropriate solid waste treatment method for a particular area is a challenging task as it requires trade-off between a pool of economic, environmental, social, and technical criteria. In recent decades, Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) has emerged as a convenient tool to address such challenging decision-making problems. This paper highlights the application of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a multi-criteria decision-making technique, in the selection of the most suitable solid waste treatment method in the context of rural areas. Three alternatives viz. Anaerobic Digestion, Vermicomposting, and Windrow Composting are evaluated against 10 criteria to obtain the priorities of the alternatives. In AHP, the final priorities of alternatives can be synthesized in two different modes: Distributive mode and Ideal mode. In this paper also, both the modes have been used and their results are compared. In both the modes, Anaerobic Digestion emerged as the most appropriate solid waste treatment method for the selected study area.

In this context, the application of smart operational policies towards future smart factories’ concepts becomes a critical issue. With the help of recent IT and technological advancements towards Industry 4.0 developments, we study intelligent autonomous vehicle operation policies where vehicles can make decentralized decisions for their safe and flexible travels between multiple aisles in a warehouse. By that, instead of assigning vehicles within a dedicated zone, we allow vehicles to travel freely between multiple aisles. The advantage of such a travel policy might result in a reduced number of vehicle requirements in a warehouse compared to a dedicated path policy. However, the disadvantage of such a flexible travel policy might be the development of smart collision and deadlock control algorithms, and that travel of vehicles might result in increased travel time during their operation due to deadlock and collision cases. First, we develop a smart travel policy approach for the vehicles using an agent-based simulation modeling approach. Then, we apply a statistical method, analysis of variance (ANOVA), to identify which input design factors significantly affect the system performance. As a result, it is observed that the number of bays is the most significant factor affecting the performance of such a system.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Business and Management, general', 'Computational Intelligence']"

The use of traditional and experimental sensor networks and the processing of the data obtained from them allow to identify anomalies in the behavior of structures in operation, as well as to implement early warning systems. The use of accelerometric sensors is helpful for identifying the representative parameters of the structural behavior; the measurements of the displacements, on the other hand, allow a quick estimate of the magnitude strictly correlated to any damage suffered by the structure during a seismic event or a failure. In this work we try to reach the last three steps of the hierarchical structures proposed by Ritter, which are remembered to be damage location, damage assessment, and prediction. To obtain these levels, it is necessary to combine all the analyzes of the simple SHM that leads to the sending of an alarm, to a cognitive capacity of the building, also achieved with the use of artificial intelligence. In particular, the connection of SHM with AI and with building information modeling (BIM) can make the system cognitive, making it capable of managing (e.g., ensure, predict, assess) the healthiness of a building.

Often through everyday interactions, parents promote cultural values related to children’s socioemotional and literacy learning. Although well understood among European populations, research on the HLE of Latino and Asian Americans is not well understood. Latinos are now the largest of the ethnic minority groups with Asian Americans the fastest growing. Sharing many common immigrant experiences, in this chapter, the HLEs of Latino and Asian Americans are explored, highlighting traditional cultural values and their influence on socioemotional and literacy learning. Among Latinos, the values of respeto (respect), familismo (familism), and bien educado (well educated) are defined. The Asian values of Confucianism, familism, filial piety, and face-saving are elaborated on. In addition, among Latino immigrants and later generations, the immigrant paradox phenomenon is explored in terms of children’s academic performance. Among Asian American children and youth, the pressures associated with the model minority stereotype are discussed. Theoretical frameworks applied to understanding the HLEs of Latino and Asian American include Bronfenbrenner’s ( 2005 ) ecological systems theory, Weisner’s ( 2002 ) ecocultural theory, and social capital theory. The chapter ends with studies on parent involvement in children’s literacy and socioemotional development.","['Education', 'Education, general', 'Early Childhood Education', 'Literacy', 'Sociology of Family, Youth and Aging', 'Latino Culture', 'Asian Culture']"

The performance of the model is better with Random Forest Classifier with an accuracy of 76%. In this paper, we majorly focus on improving the quality of education by enhancing student engagement throughout the course.

The research method consists in the use of triaxial tests to determine the cohesion and the angle of internal friction of silty loam at different humidity of samples groups. Each group consists of 18 samples with the same moisture. Three samples were taken from this group and tested by triaxial compression. As a result, selections of experimental data were obtained, which contained 6 values of cohesion and internal friction angle, as well as selections of effective shear resistance parameters. Samples of experimental data of deformation modules of subgrade soils were processed by methods of mathematical statistics. During data processing, each selection is checked for gross errors. The application of the t-criterion made it possible to determine the calculated values of the shear resistance characteristics. Using the established values of cohesion and the angle of internal friction, the parameters of the material of other plasticity conditions are calculated: Drucker-Prager, Matsuoka-Nakai, Lada-Duncan, etc. Similar tests were carried out with other groups of samples, but at different ground moisture. According to the experimental data of such samples, the parameters of shear resistance at other ground humidity were determined. As a result, tabular functional dependencies of shear resistance characteristics on soil moisture were obtained.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

Therefore, it is of great importance to build models that appropriately derive and preside over the spread of the epidemic to improve the control of epidemics. As well as to adopt appropriate strategies to avoid or at least mitigate its spread faster, different modeling methods have been proposed to build epidemiological models, we find the use of an agent-based model which makes it possible to reproduce the real behavior of the daily course of individuals already seen in the previous article [ 1 ], However this article presents in the same context stimulates the spread of covid using stochastic SIR model (Susceptible - Infected – Recovered) and its extension SVIRD (Susceptible - Vaccinated - Infected - Recovered – Death) which takes into consideration the vaccination parameter. Results: For a sample of 50 citizens network, we used a combination of simulations for the 4 parameters in SVIRD model, The result of the simulation shows that: The more connected a population is, the higher vaccination rates need to be to effectively protect the population.

At a specified time after beginning of the process, additive is added to modify contents of melt. Additive is mixed by argon-stirred melt especially in vessel. Duration of additive homogenization and other unknowns are estimated using mathematical model based on elliptic coordinates. They fit geometry of immersed vessel with two snorkels. It is assumed that melt is incompressible viscous Newtonian fluid, which consists of inert gas and additive. Speed of gas floatation is constant. Navier-Stokes equations define dynamics of the fluid and are solved using central difference scheme. Such results of numerical modeling as velocity distribution and mixing behavior are compared to the measured data presented in scientific literature.

The system under consideration involves semi-Markov stochastic process related to Weibull distribution. The main motivation for this chapter is that the positive condition sometimes needs to be considered in S-MJSs and the controller design methods in the existing works have some conservation. To deal with these problems, some sufficient conditions for stochastic stability of positive S-MJSs are established by implying the linear co-positive Lyapunov function. Then, some sufficient conditions for $$\mathscr {L}_1$$ L 1 -gain constraint are also presented, upon which, a state feedback controller is designed by decomposing the controller gain matrix such that the resulting closed-loop system is positive and stochastically stable with $$\mathscr {L}_1$$ L 1 -gain performance in the form of standard linear programming. The advantages of the new framework lie in the following facts: (i) the weak infinitesimal operator is derived for S-MJSs under the constraint of positive condition and (ii) the less conservative stabilizing controller is designed to achieve the desired control performance.

How to plan a flyable path for UAV formation when flying with a given configuration to the destination safely is an important technology. Therefore, this paper proposes a path planning method based on Pythagorean Hodograph (PH) curves and Delaunay triangulation to generate a flyable reference path for UAV formation. Firstly, the kinematic constraints of the formation path are derived, while the formation moves. Secondly, the Delaunay triangulation and the Warshall-Floyd algorithm are used to obtain the best waypoints array from starting point to destination. Thirdly, the PH curves are applied to connect each two neighbour waypoints for meeting the kinematic constraints. The multi-population hybrid particle swarm genetic algorithm is proposed to generate an optimal flyable formation path. Finally, simulations are carried out considering a formation with three UAVs in a complicated environment. The simulation results show that the paths planned are connected by several PH curves, and all the paths can meet the kinematic constraints, avoid the obstacles and threat zones. Furthermore, the single population particle swarm genetic algorithm is also applied in the same simulation, and the simulation results show that the multi-population hybrid particle swarm genetic algorithm proposed in this paper has faster convergence speed and better stability.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

Removing eigenfrequencies of a structure from the interval of working frequencies reduces the probability of resonance during operation. In this contribution, a structural optimization problem is formulated whose objective at a minimum removes all eigenfrequencies from a given frequency interval. We consider systems without damping whose mass and stiffness matrices depend continuously on real parameters. The approach relies on the identity proposed by Futamura for eigenvalue count on intervals. The identity uses a contour integral in a complex plane of a trace of a specially constructed matrix. The contour integral is evaluated numerically using the trapezoidal rule over a circular path. The latter expression is differentiable. Present contribution extends the identity by adding a concave weighting function strictly positive in the interval. Furthermore, an explicit expression for the gradient of the objective and a simple optimization strategy are presented. Finally, a multi-degree of freedom example illustrates the performance of the approach.","['Energy', 'Energy Systems', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Structural Materials', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer']"

In case of the non-associated Mohr-Coulomb model, the method can oscillate with respect to the refinement of a finite element mesh. To suppress this drawback, the non-associated model is approximated by the associated one such that the strength parameters are reduced by using a function depending on a scalar factor and on the effective friction and dilatancy angles. This modification (MSSRM) can be easily implemented in commercial codes like Plaxis or Comsol Multiphysics. Next, an optimization approach to the modified SSRM (OPT-MSSRM) is introduced. It is shown that the optimization problem is well-defined and can be analyzed by variational principles. For its solution, a regularization method is combined with mesh adaptivity and implemented in Matlab.

The main objective is to ameliorate the reliability of the production systems based on the number and reliability of redundant components under some constraints such as the cost, volume, the budget, etc. This problem is considered as a constrained nonlinear mixed-integer problem that can be modelled with two different ways: A Redundancy Allocation Problem (RAP) or a Reliability-Redundancy Allocation Problem (RRAP). The developed MAPSO is based on a new updating procedure that allows to adjust the position of particles, without dealing with velocity. Position updating is based on a simple expression using two parameters that help to speed up the convergence of the suggested algorithm and prevent it from being trapped within the local optimum. To assess the efficacity of the suggested method, the MAPSO is applied to solve reliability problems related to a power distribution plant system.

Stresses are specified on the layer boundary, while displacements are set on the pipe internal surface. The off-center compressive stresses at the layer surfaces cause the layer and its rigidly connected pipe to rotate. The problem is solved using the analytic-numerical generalized Fourier method, which is applied to Lamé equations in pipe-associated cylindrical coordinates and layer-associated Cartesian coordinates. When the boundary conditions are satisfied, a system of infinite linear algebraic equations is formed suitable to apply the method of reduction. As a result, the stresses and displacements at different points of the composite body are obtained. The accuracy of the boundary conditions approaches 10 –4 for zero to one values. The stress state at the layer-pipe interface, as well as on the inner surface of the pipe depending on the thickness of the pipe and the location of the load has been analyzed. The load shift from the pipe center along the layer surface, as well as a decrease in the inner radius of the pipe cause a significant increase in tangential stresses at the pipe interfaces. Areas of maximum stresses are shown.","['Energy', 'Energy Systems', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Structural Materials', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer']"

Physical modeling and characterization of performance are essential for design optimization of CFTs, but rather few research efforts have been dedicated to them to date. A multi-objective design optimization study is performed in the present study, based on evolutionary algorithms incorporating magnetic simulation coupled with an improved power balance model. It aims to simultaneously maximize the performance parameters, namely thrust, total efficiency, and specific impulse, with the anode voltage and current, mass flow rate, and magnet radii employed as the decision variables. Covariance-based global sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify influential design parameters. Uncertainty analysis is performed using prediction from surrogate models via machine learning by means of Monte Carlo simulation to examine the effects on uncertainties in the design parameters on the performance parameters. The plasma behavior inside the channel and the plume region has been investigated with primary focus on the magnetic field strength. In so doing, physical insights have been gained into key design factors to maximize CFT performance.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

The analysis of the communication system is carried out considering an extended version of the OSI stack that includes an additional layer placed below the Physical Layer (PL). In this further layer, called the Deep Physical Layer (DPL), the communication process is analyzed in terms of distinguishable electromagnetic field configurations on the receiving antenna. The DPL contains all the resources potentially available to the telecommunication system in terms of space/time/polarization field configurations, while the PL implements specific solutions to exploit the potential offered by the DPL. Such a potential is limited only by the physical laws, which are inviolable. Consequently, the limits imposed at the level of DPL are absolute. In this sense, the DPL is a more fundamental level than the PL. The numerous solutions proposed for 6G that include intelligent modifications of the propagation environment can be seen as “data processing” at the DPL level in order to preserve information lost in previous generations of communication systems.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Computer Communication Networks']"

Only membrane and bending parts are taken into account in the formulation, whereas the transverse shear strains are neglected. By using the variational principle, the weak form of equilibrium equations is derived. Then, the displacement and strain of the FGM skew plate are discretized using a four nodes finite element leading to the construction of the geometric and material stiffness matrices. The critical buckling load is determined, then by the resolution of the eigenvalue problem. Two types of thermal loadings, namely uniform and non-uniform temperature rises through the thickness direction are taken into account. The thermomechanical properties of the FGM skew plate are temperature-dependent and can vary continuously through the thickness direction of the constituents according to a power- law distribution. Different numerical simulations are performed, where the validity of the formulation is first checked through a comparative study. Next, parametric analysis is carried out. The influence of several important parameters such as power-law index, thermal effects and skew angle is presented and discussed. It is concluded that these parameters play a significant role in the thermomechanical buckling response of FGM skew plates.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Materials Engineering', 'Classical and Continuum Physics']"

The transient emission (WHTC) characteristics of three-way catalyst (TWC) on the engine rig are studied based on the design enhancements aforementioned above, along with the precious group metals (PGMs) loadings and specific PGM ratios. However, the catalyst with higher PGM loading and specific PGM ratio supported significantly to light-off swiftly for the TWC after-treatment system as well as for reduction of peak emissions. Though, in this study, NO x and CH 4 emissions are considered as the key emissions, and the air–fuel ratio parameters are optimized accordingly. Furthermore, for the selected PGM concentration, the NH 3 emission is observed to increase in cold-start cycle, due to steam reforming reactions over the TWC system, and the catalyst effectiveness is recognized in hot-start cycle with NH 3 reduction. Nevertheless, in the TWC formulation, the Pd is indispensable to meet the emission regulation limit. However, to minimize the cost for TWC as well as to maintain higher emission conversion margin, bringing down the Rh content as well as enhancing the Pt/Pd ratio could be a viable solution. A right balance between the cost and performance of TWC is provided as the scientific reference in this paper. Overall, the emissions met the legal limits with good engineering emission margin.","['Energy', 'Energy Systems', 'Energy Storage', 'Renewable and Green Energy']"

Sensor nodes’ mobility models for UWSN vary from WSN devices on the ground. This variation complicates handover prediction in these networks, which is a key difficulty. As a result, the current study focuses on handover optimization. UWSN handover and optimization in UWSN handover have received only sporadic attention. Thus, this paper offers a simulation of sensor nodes’ movement calculated data. The speed and direction of the water flow between the data points are included in this dataset. Sensor nodes and base stations in a UWSN are used to simulate the suggested simulation. For the handover optimization job, all of the handover events that occur throughout the simulation are collected. Handover events are optimized using PSO, MVO, and ACO techniques based on historical data obtained from previous handovers. This paper provides the ideal option to increase reliability in the case of UWSN.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-20353-4_15,en,Frequency Analysis of Microbeam with Axial Pretension Using MSGT,OriginalPaper,"This paper presents the variation in natural frequencies of Euler-Bernoulli microbeams when subjected to axial pretension. The influence of size effects has been analysed using modified strain gradient theory (MSGT). The governing equation of motion has been derived using extended Hamilton’s principle and variational calculus. The sixth order non-local governing differential equation is solved by analytical procedure and numerical differential quadrature method (DQM). The three end conditions of beams are considered: cantilever, simply supported, and clamped-clamped beams. It is found that MSGT accurately models the size effects compared to other theories. As the axial pretension increases from 0.0001 to 1 N, the natural frequency values for the beam with different boundary conditions increase. Subsequently, surface elasticity effects have been analysed for a silicon and aluminium-based nanobeams with the pretension of 0.0001 N for all boundary conditions. From the results of surface elasticity modeling, it has been concluded that the natural frequencies of the nanobeam get influenced either positive or negative based on the value of surface elastic modulus. The difference in natural frequency values with and without surface elasticity effects are approximately 5 and $$2\%$$ for Si and Al nanobeams respectively. The methodology presented in this work can further be validated for nanoscale devices in which the higher-order strain gradient and surface elasticity effects subjected to pretension dominate.","['Engineering', 'Nanotechnology and Microengineering', 'Mechatronics', 'Machinery and Machine Elements']"

Furthermore, the proposed MPC scheme enables recursive collision-avoidance constraint satisfaction in the presence of pop-up or moving obstacles (e.g., pedestrians, cyclists, human-driven vehicles), provided that their predicted future motion trajectory is available together with some uncertainty bound and satisfies some mild requirement.

The second wave outbreak of the mutant SARS-CoV-2 has statistically proved to hold an exponential growth of mortality rate, especially in India. The infection-recovery strategy observed could be easily modeled to the SIR(Susceptible-Infectious-Recovery) model. Also, the studies included the exposure to the virus resulting in SIER (Susceptible-Infection-Exposure-Recovery) model. The daily statistics published by the World Health Organization (WHO) also reveal unavoidable statistics that represent the count of deaths. As of May 30, 2021, India has reported 27 million total infected cases, and 32 hundred thousand deaths have been reported. This alarms that the spread of pandemics cannot be visualized as a simple SIR model. The significant ratio between the infected and the mortals leads to remodeling the SIR model as SIR-M(Susceptible-Infectious-Recovery-Mortality) model. This paper includes the death count into the model and remodels the SIR model as SIR-M(Susceptible-Infectious-Recovery-Mortality) model. Our proposed model includes a factor, namely $$\delta $$ δ , which primarily depends on the medical condition. This $$\delta $$ δ is the primary cause of the deaths in the SARS-Cov-2-affected patients.

The development of the science of materials with a low-dimensional and aperiodic structure has again highlighted the problem of modeling the nucleation of growth and deformation of lattice structures. When considering structural changes in modified materials, one has to face the contradictions between the infinity of the ideal and the finiteness of the corresponding real lattices. The problem of the dimensional ordering of the structure in the modified layers is closely related to the internal geometry of the crystal structure, since the structural changes occurring under any forms of exposure are related to the internal crystallographic model. In the subsurface modified layers, which have nonequilibrium properties and exchange mass and energy with the environment, various types of self-organization and ordered behavior of structural elements are observed, which today cannot be explained within the framework of the accepted crystal-chemical models.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-09835-2_15,en,A Novel Codebook Generation by Lévy Flight Based Firefly Algorithm,OriginalPaper,"Nature inspired metaheuristic algorithms are become more powerful and useful in image processing algorithms especially by the developments in microprocessor technology. In the last several decades the Linde-Buzo-Gray algorithm is a powerful technique for local optimum codebook generation in image compression. Fuzzy C-Means and C-Means are the alternative ones for the same process. On the other hand nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms have also become other alternate technics for designing the optimum codebook. In this paper the Firefly technique is enhanced by the Lévy flight function to achieve the global optimum codebook. The Firefly technique contains two sub search mechanisms to reach the global minimum solution. The first one is the attraction of any firefly by a brighter one. This process strongly guides to the firefly on the global minimum way especially if it is attracted by the brightest one. The second one is the random search of a firefly in a circle with a radius of $$\alpha $$ . On the other hand if $$\alpha $$ is determined so big, the firefly may lose its way and come to a location that is much far away from the firefly group and possibly there is no brighter firefly to be followed. On the contrary, if $$\alpha $$ is determined so small, this time the fireflies fall into a local minimum and can not escape. Therefore we need to have such an $$\alpha $$ that in most of the iterations its value changes in a small random value interval, but in rare iterations its value must be relatively big in order to escape local minimums. Therefore if a firefly is captured by a local minimum point by accidentally, Lévy Flight step provides an opportunity to escape from it easily. Numerical results suggest that the new introduced Lévy Flight based Firefly Algorithm is better than the classical techniques and provides the global optimum codebook for image compression.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

A stochastic analysis provides a valid design method to analyse such critical subjects. Five failure criteria, viz. maximum strain, maximum stress, Tsai–Hill, Tsai–Wu and Hoffman theories, are employed to analyse the first-ply failure of the laminated plate. At first, a probabilistic model is developed based on the MCS approach with stochasticity in input material properties. To reduce the computational time, MLS is utilized as the surrogate model.

The main aim of this study is to review the different modeling methodologies for crack initiation under low cycle fatigue. These models are divided into three main types: microscopic models, damage parameters, and probabilistic models. There is no preferred methodology among the ones discussed.

In Russia, research in this area is carried out mainly in the field of technical resilience, while in Western Europe this area is considered more broadly and also includes environmental, psychological, social and economic resilience. When studying the resilience of energy systems, the authors are based on studies of energy security that use the concept of situational management. For a qualitative description of situations, it is proposed to use intelligent technologies, in particular, cognitive modeling based on a graph representation of cognitive models. After a qualitative assessment of the situation, it is usually desirable for a decision maker (DM) to have a quantitative justification for the recommended decisions. To meet this requirement, it is proposed to integrate intelligent and mathematical technologies. The team represented by the authors developed the cognitive modeling tool CogMap and reengineered the existing version of the legacy SP INTEC (a modern version of the multi-agent SP - INTEC-A was developed). Currently, the results of cognitive modeling are entered into the PC manually, while work is underway to automate the transition from cognitive maps to ExS scenarios in INTEC-A. An example of a computational experiment using cognitive models and INTEC-A software is given.

This article provides a study of the process of washing the working surfaces of metallic and non-metallic friction elements at the micro level. The obtained equations of motion, energy balance and diffusion of the boundary layer of the air flow near the working surfaces make it possible to evaluate the criteria that affect the process of air change in the boundary layer. Its thickness is proposed as the defining criteria for assessing the boundary layer of an air flow near friction pairs. When considering the air flow as homogeneous, the determining criterion is the thickness of the dynamic boundary layer. If in the boundary layer chemical processes occurring during the interaction of working surfaces with an air flow are taken into account, then the criteria for assessing the energy and diffusion state are the thicknesses of the thermal and diffusion boundary layers. Depending on the composition and concentration of components in the boundary layer of the air flow, the ratio of its various thicknesses can be estimated. The obtained dependences make it possible to determine the nature of formation and possible methods of counteracting the insulating nature of the boundary layer.

The use of the provisions from the theory of the vibration strength «viruses» allows us to construct systems of integral equations (IE) for layered media with flat defects.

The purpose of the work presented is to construct a solution for the integral equation of the steady-state oscillation problem on an elastic layer caused by vibration of the edges of an internal fracture with finite dimensions and zero thickness using a modified FAM. In the paper, we present an algorithm for solving the IE with a growing kernel symbol for the vibration problem of a singular flat fracture in a layer, which can further be used to solve equation systems of dynamic problems for a package of layers with discontinuity in their connections. The FAM, being a semi-analytical method, makes it possible to investigate the features of the IE solutions and take them into account during the development of numerical algorithms.","['Mathematics', 'Numerical Analysis', 'Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis']"

The methodology of RR has advanced considerably in recent years. Nevertheless, most research in this area concern only simple random sampling. Data from complex survey designs require special consideration with regard to estimation for parameters and corresponding variance estimation. There are a body of research literature on alternative techniques for eliciting suitable RR schemes in order to estimate parameters for sensitive characteristics, but no existing software covers the estimation of these procedures from complex surveys. This gap is filled by RRTCS . In this paper we highlight the main features of the package. The package includes the estimators for means and totals with several RR techniques and also provides confidence interval estimation for the entire population and considering domains. We illustrate the use of this software with three real surveys referring to alcohol abuse, collection of subsidies and gender violence.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Data Engineering', 'Statistics for Engineering, Physics, Computer Science, Chemistry and Earth Sciences', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Mathematical Applications in Computer Science']"

This statement is especially true in the case of (very) large networks which cannot be reduced to compositions of simpler (e.g., series and parallel) networks, e.g., those containing complex bridge-type sub-networks. A promising, and not much explored approach, is to borrow concepts and methods from electrical circuits, in particular the delta-wye transformation which has long been established and used for computing exactly the equivalent resistance of a resistor network. We shall review how such concepts (from electronics) should be adapted and applied to reliability evaluations, showing that (as opposed to the case of electrical circuits) these are not always exact, hence sometimes leading to reliability estimates. We shall exemplify approximations of the reliability polynomials when using delta-wye transformations, and show that this approach is able to significantly reduce complexity. Finally, we will apply the delta-wye transformation method to the Moore-Shannon hammock networks (for the first time ever), and show how hammock networks can be transformed into ladder networks/graphs whose reliability can be easily computed by a recurrence formula.

",OriginalPaper,"Charles Darwin postulated the concept of “survival-of-the-fittest” and evolution in general. He discussed how nature selects the best candidate under different situations who are fit enough to survive and reproduce. This analogy has inspired many computational scientists, bioinformaticians, and computational biologists to develop techniques that can learn, adapt, and evolve to find optimal solutions for complex problems. Biologists are heavily dependent on computational methods and strategies to analyze humongous biological and medical data. Nature-inspired computing (NIC) encapsulates an ensemble of myriad studies of computer science, statistics, mathematics, and biological sciences where the essence is to adapt and develop robust competing techniques just like nature. It is a novel approach to optimization algorithms that are motivated by the dynamics of the biological evolution of our natural milieu. Over the past decade, various nature-inspired optimization algorithms have been deployed to solve complex problems in bioinformatics, engineering, and other sciences. With the glorious artificial intelligence (AI) revolution in biological sciences, there have been times when some problems are nonlinear in nature with multiple constraints and some techniques are hard to deploy. To solve high dimensionality issues and time complexity in such cases, NIC algorithms are the best choice to be used to solve complex optimization problems.

This chapter shows the application of measurement in a social science context where the motivation is transparency and equity rather than the advancement of scientific laws. However, to achieve these, the realization of measurement needs to be no less rigorous than it is in the advancement of scientific laws. Rasch measurement theory provides the basis for such rigor. The context in this chapter is competitive selection into universities in Western Australia based on a summary performance on a series of instruments which assess achievement in a range of discipline areas. Such selection tends to determine life opportunities; therefore to ensure consistency and fairness, performances on different instruments need to be transformed into measurements which are in the same, explicit unit relative to a specified origin. Because the illustrative context is complex, it is considered that the Rasch measurement theory applied in this chapter could be applied to a range of social contexts where assessments on different instruments need to be transformed to measurements in a common unit referenced to a common origin and where the focus is on making decisions at the person level.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Health Informatics', 'Psychometrics', 'Health Administration']"

Simulation modeling gives highly appreciable solutions by providing a clear picture of complex systems. The reason for the same is that nonlinear structure of real-world problems with complexities cannot be handled by linearized models. Further, computational complexities of large-scale dynamical system simulations occurring in such situations will be reduced by model order reduction (MOR). This is further improved with the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this paper, the generalized neural network modeling of nonlinear autonomous dissipative system using machine learning and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) has been addressed, which is a novel one. The fluid mechanical model considered here is trained with multiple temporal swatches evolved on different parametric variations and trialed out at different time instances. Machine learning tries to learn such models by analyzing snapshot observations from active systems. The neural network developed by machine learning is able to make better prediction for validating data which is different from the training data set. The complexity of the data set generated by nonlinear autonomous dissipative system is reduced by applying the POD on the original data set. This demonstrates that the neural network is successfully utilized to macromodel the autonomous dynamical system.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Solid Mechanics']"

The development of a “networked” society creates demands for digital communication and provides ready access to specialized knowledge and alternative models of practice. For teachers, ICT impacts the nature of their work as well as their ability to access professional development. ICT offers the possibility of ready access to both curricular materials and professional development, increasing the time teachers must spend to stay “current” in their field. ICT also expands teacher access (in communities with sufficient technological infrastructure) to geographically isolated students or communities. ICT also promotes the grassroots sharing of curricular material and can promote communication and group activism among teachers. As a “mass” profession, teachers are in a weaker position than established professions (e.g., medicine) to control the ways in which new technologies shape their work. Globalization, paradoxically, has resulted in a more professionalized role for teachers in a few nations while in general eroding the professional status of teaching in many others. ICT also affects individual teachers’ lives by increasing demands for personal communications with parents and students.

A deeper understanding of these nonlinearities and the parametric dependencies thereof has the potential to enable the formulation of robust, energy-efficient control strategies. Moreover, input constraints and/or delays significantly impact the controlled system performance and overall system stability. In this work, we present a systematic investigation to test the performance of control methodology in the presence of delay and control input constraints. Impact oscillators have been proved to be suitable testbeds to implement nonlinear control methods considering the system’s dynamic rather than using high, control-effort-consuming gains. Therefore, a mass-excited impact oscillator is chosen as a candidate system to demonstrate the proposed control scheme’s effectiveness. As a case study, the coexistence of impacting and non-impacting behaviour of the system is considered. A time-delayed feedback (TDF) scheme is employed in closed loop with the impact oscillator to achieve a non-impacting solution. Subsequently, the closed-loop performance of the overall system with and without constraints and delay are simulated and contrasted. It has been observed that the controller successfully exchanges the chosen attractors. However, the controller fails to stabilise the system with higher delays and constraints, even with higher gains. Therefore a new approach would be required to deal with delays and constraints in such scenarios.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis']"

The cylinder is loaded by its boundary r = a, where the perfect drainage conditions are fulfilled, and the boundaries z = 0 and z = h are in slide contact and undrained conditions. The initial conditions are zero. The initial problem is reduced to the one-dimensional problem with the help of Laplace and Fourier integral transforms applied by t and z variables respectively. The one-dimensional problem in transform space is formulated in a vector form, which is solved with the help of matrix differential calculation apparatus. According to it the corresponding matrix equation is considered, and the system of fundamental matrix solutions is constructed by the contour integral calculation. So, the exact solution of the vector boundary problem in Laplace-Fourier transform space is derived. The Heaviside expansion theorem is used to invert Laplace transforms, and the stress and pore pressure values are investigated for different ratios between a and h, and for different poroelastic materials.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis']"

These include Condition Monitoring (CM) in rotating machinery as well as Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) for civil structures. However, several distinct entropy definitions are available in the scientific literature, each with its advantages and limitations. In the present paper, the potential of the family of Rényi entropies is evaluated. The order $$\alpha$$ α is varied between 0 (corresponding to the Hartley entropy, i.e., the Max-entropy) and $$+ \infty$$ + ∞ (Min-entropy), encompassing $$\alpha \to 1$$ α → 1 (Shannon-entropy) and $$\alpha = 2$$ α = 2 (Collision entropy) as particular cases of special interest. The Wigner-Ville (WV), Smoothed Pseudo Wigner Ville (SPWV), Discrete Choi-Williams (DCW), and Continuous Wavelet (CWT) transforms are all tested for the time-frequency (TF) distribution of the target signal. In turn, this TF is used to compute the probability density function, from which the ISE is estimated. A sensitivity analysis is run on all the parameters for each candidate TF transform, aiming at defining the best settings. All studies were performed on a well-known experimental dataset, the three-storey aluminium frame structure developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratories, considering the undamaged conditions as the normality model. The results show good potential for entropy-based real-time damage detection, especially for breathing cracks.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The suggested regret decision theory is scenario-based rather than the other theories. The process of the suggested theory is split into two stages. The first stage is to consider every possible lowest bidding offered by the auctioneers and select the one action point from the bidding price. After selecting the action point in the second stage, a decision-maker evaluates the best bidding price that produces the best results for him. Our model captures the various preferences for risk in such auction issues, which are considerably different from the typical auction model based on probability distribution in which maximizing expected utility is the aim.

Millions of trials are required in MCS to achieve a robust reliability calculation with an acceptable margin of error. The high computational cost of conducting millions of trails presents a major challenge for using MCS in reliability-based software’s. Modified methods have been proposed in the literature to reduce the computational cost of conducting reliability analyses for nonlinear limit states such as importance sampling, line sampling, subset simulation, etc. Although the existing modified methods reduce the computational cost, further optimization is required to improve the efficiency of the reliability calculation when used in commercial software packages. The objectives of this research are to: (1) develop a procedure for conducting Active Learning Kriging Monte Carlo Simulation (AK-MCS) analysis to assess the reliability of bridge girders; and (2) utilize the developed procedure in conducting a sensitivity analysis to propose an optimum Kriging configuration for the reliability analysis. The sensitivity analysis considered three key parameters in the Kriging part of the simulation: choice of regression model, correlation functions, and learning functions. A total of 486 analyses were conducted in this study. Analysis results recommend using quadratic regression function with a spline correlation function and H learning function to assess the reliability of bridge girders.

The IFS being capable of handling any hesitancy or indeterminacy, the IF9IM determines relationship between two uncertain objects having any indeterminacy.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Engineering Design', 'Machine Learning', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

The compression techniques target decreasing the size of data representing the trajectory to minimize the cost of transferring and processing these data. Key aspects of compression techniques is to achieve highest possible accuracy with maximum compression ratio as possible in a reasonable time. This paper targets compression in IoT domain, prioritizing the complexity of the algorithm (performance) key aspect. An implementation for the batched Sliding Window (SW) technique is introduced in this paper, in addition to two novel approaches. A real time Fuzzy Sampler (FS) approach using fuzzy compression that resulted in a significant improvement in the running time compared to the offline and batched SW techniques, while resulting in a smaller compression ratio. Another approach Fuzzy Sampling Window Segmentation (FSW) is to add the FS as a filter to the batched SW technique which resulted in a significant improvement in performance compared to traditional techniques and small decrease in compression ratio. The FS technique is more suitable for low complexity hardware, where small computational power are available, while the FSW requires higher computational power compared to FS and results in higher compression ratios, thus lower transfer cost.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

During the pandemic, the people experienced various restrictions and different problems were raised unlike before. While the people stayed in their homes, electronic device usage had a decisive spike. This increased time spent on the internet and the amount of misinformation followed the same trend. The problem with the information on the COVID-19 is that there are too many different sources presenting different data. While some are just trying to help and do not have the latest or the most accurate information, some sources are malicious. Either way, everything but the latest and the most accurate data needs to be filtered when regarding a serious matter as such. The research proposed in this manuscript is aimed to identify COVID-19 fake news by performing wrapper-based feature by using an improved version of the well-known firefly algorithm. Practical simulations were done against a well-known dataset used in the domain of this problem, Koirala. The proposed method managed to achieve high accuracy of classification by using a smaller number of features in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods tested in the same experimental environment.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Four groups of specimens made with different reinforcement materials were tested. The structure of reinforcement ensured quasi-isotropic properties of the material. Based on experimental data, the patterns of damage accumulation and failure for these materials are considered. The damage to material is assessed in terms of three criteria: damage to binder, rupture of individual fibers, and through-type fracture. Experiments have established that the resistance to the explosion of GRP specimens is much higher than that of the CFRP specimens under consideration in terms of individual fiber ruptures. Computer models have been developed and verified using LS-DYNA and AUTODYN software for the experimental conditions.

In the livestock sector, information on the health, production and reproduction of animals is automatically collected and interpreted to provide guiding information to the operators, and the software written specifically in this direction is rapidly increasing. In dairy and beef cattle, this type of software is called “herd tracking system”. Although there are many software used in the market, a small number of herd tracking systems, which are advantageous with the services they provide or the hardware they have, and which are preferred more intensely, constitute an oligopoly market. The power of being preferred contributes to R&D and investment budgets, and this increases the preferability of software. The criteria that users consider when choosing the program: It varies according to the business structure (dairy/fattening focused) and subjective requests. The criteria accepted as basic are not subject to an objective measurement system. At this point, since the comparison of the alternatives according to the criteria is made based on the linguistic expressions of the users, the ranking process has a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making problem structure. In this study, four different herd tracking software were ranked according to seven different criteria. The CRITIC method was used to weigh the criteria, and the fuzzy ARAS and fuzzy TOPSIS methods were used to rank the alternatives. As a result of the findings obtained from the analyses, the four major herd tracking software were ranked according to seven different criteria.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Optimization', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory']"

Herewith either the characteristics of the object of study or the characteristics of the specialist’s experience and thinking whose intelligence is transmitted to the machine are not taken into account. In this regard, various approaches to the study of ways of thinking (in this case, modeling and decision-making) are analyzed. In particular probabilistic theory; Dempster-Shafer justification theory; Lukaciewicz logic; procedures based on the provisions of the theory of fuzzy sets; idempotent mathematics are considered. The concept of the “information space of research” is introduced, that includes a set of key attributes that adequately describe the objects (situations) of the study; the agreed scale of measuring of features; the metric of the corresponding feature space. A mechanism for a formalized description of the information field of research based on experimentation with the specialist’s statements is proposed. The essence of this mechanism is as follows: a specialist expert sets analytical ratios “equal”, “greater”, “less” for a set of given objects (situations) defining his private vision of the structure of the connections of these objects. The solution of the corresponding inequalities gives weight coefficients to the features of objects and a measure of proximity between them.

In this chapter attention will be focused on those particular kinds of abductive cognition that generate deep results, able to go beyond data thanks to a rich explanatory strength, in which asking “why” is the key-factor. Hypothetical cognition beyond data will be also described thanks to the illustration of model-based aspects of abduction, in which the activity of grasping the world, beyond what mere rough data suggests, takes advantage of models, diagrams, and simulations of various nature. Moreover, I will delineate the concept of manipulative abduction, first introduced in my book of Abduction, Reason, and Science , by showing how we can find methods of manipulative constructivity, in which cognitive processes are centered on the exploitation of external representations to the aim of reaching deep and very abstract results, able to powerfully transcend data, at the same time to create cognitive values “in” and “out” of data. In two separated sections I will illustrate (1) how the excessive emphasis on the merits of the computational programs which learn from data renders human abductive “creative” cognition increasingly assaulted and jeopardized, and (2) the challenges against human abduction and epistemic rigor on the part of what I call computational invasive “subcultures” based on rough computational explanations. Finally, thanks to the analysis of the computational system called AlphaGo , I will stress the attention to what I call locked and unlocked strategies that shed further light on the cognitive aspects of both humans and deep learning machines. The character and the role of these cognitive strategies is strictly related to the generation of cognitive outputs, which range from weak (closer to data) to strong level (beyond data) of knowledge creativity. Locked abductive strategies, even if cognitively weak, characterize (sometimes amazing) kinds of hypothetical creative reasoning and are typical of intelligent machines based on a massive exploitation of data, but they are limited in eco-cognitive openness , which instead qualifies human cognizers who are performing higher kinds of abductive creative reasoning, where cognitive strategies are instead unlocked and are able to transcend data.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Although the quasi-periodic behavior is the characteristic of conservative systems, whether the system is conservative has been unknown. In this paper, we decompose the dynamical system of waterbomb tube into three steps and represent the one-step using the two kinds of mappings between zigzag polygonal linkages. By changing parameters of the mappings and composite them, we generalize the dynamical system of waterbomb tube to that of various tubular origami tessellations and show their oscillating configurations.

It is assumed that shell is fabricated of functionally graded materials. Mathematical model has been constructed on base of shear deformation shell theory of the higher-order (HSDT). Voigt’s model is applied to define effective material properties of the structure. To study a shell with an arbitrary planform the R-functions theory combined with the variational Ritz method is used.

As there are multiple flying objects, including airplanes, birds, helicopters, drones and so on, which can only fly to move from one place to another place, it is necessary to detect these objects accurately by regularly monitoring the existence of malicious UAVs. A malicious UAV carrying unnecessary payload is the one that can cause severe harm to the environment. This malicious UAV activity should be detected by differentiating it from other flying objects. In this work, the malicious UAV with unnecessary load is detected in a computer vision-based monitoring system, which is driven by supervised machine intelligence model and SqueezeNet, a deep neural network-based image embedder. The models used for accurately classifying the malicious UAV images are neural network (NN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), naïve Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbour (k-NN), AdaBoost (AB) and logistic regression (LR). Simulation process has been carried out in Orange 3.26.0 data analytics tool. From the result, it is evident that the neural networks (NNs) have generated higher classification accuracy (CA) of about 92.01% for accurately detecting the malicious UAV images by classifying the malicious UAVs from other flying object images.

In mathematical terms, such systems are called deterministic dynamical systems. In the analysis of such system, continuity is usually understood in the usual mathematical sense. However, as many formal definitions, the mathematical definition of continuity does not always adequately capture the commonsense notion of continuity: that small changes in the input should lead to small changes in the output. In this paper, we provide a natural fuzzy-based formalization of this intuitive notion, and analyze how the requirement of commonsense continuity affects the properties of dynamical systems. Specifically, we show that for such systems, the set of stationary states is closed and convex, and that the only such systems for which we can both effectively predict the future and effectively reconstruct the past are linear systems.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Engineering']"

The change of the values can be modeled with differential equations. Roughly speaking, a typical differential equation in finance has two components, one deterministic (e.g., rate of interest of bank accounts) and one stochastic (e.g., values of stocks) that is often related to the notion of Brownian motions. The solution of such a differential equation needs the evaluation of Riemann–Stieltjes’s integrals for the deterministic part and Ito’s integrals for the stochastic part. For A few types of such differential equations, it is possible to determine an exact solution, e.g., a geometric Brownian motion. On the other side for almost all stochastic differential equations we can only provide approximations of a solution. We present some numerical methods for solving stochastic differential equations.","['Economics', 'Health Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences/Technology', 'Economics, general', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Biotechnology', 'Economic Theory/Quantitative Economics/Mathematical Methods']"

Generally physical inspections are carried out to detect defects in structures for further rectification. With recent advancements in computational algorithms, machine vision based inspection is emerging as an efficient technique for monitoring structural health of structures. Surface cracks in concrete structures are one of the important indicators of its health and enable the assessment of serviceability of the structures. The present work aims to address the issue by developing a novel system using machine vision and deep learning. A convolutional neural network-based methodology is developed to detect surface cracks in concrete cube images. The implementation of proposed methodology is demonstrated through monitoring of crack development in concrete cubes of size 150 × 150 × 150 mm with different compression strengths. The concrete cubes are subjected to compression loading in a standard compression testing machine. The analysis results in location, area, length, and number of cracks in synchronization with the applied compression load. The number of cracks, area of cracks, and length of cracks with respect to compression load are acquired using the developed system for different grades of concrete cubes. Results show that cracks detection and monitoring have been accurately performed with the developed system. The observations obtained from the crack load analysis can be very useful for improved understanding of concrete behaviour.

This airborne turbulence applies unwanted forces and moments to the aircraft and disturbs the movement of the aircraft, interfering with the presumed performance prescribed by the controller. A Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (NDI) control law is especially prone to degradation, proportional to model uncertainties caused by turbulence. To solve this issue, a Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion Controller based on the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is proposed as a disturbance observer. With the help of the Gaussian Process regression, model uncertainties from the turbulence are estimated for the feed-forward term, to aid the performance of the NDI control law. The Dryden model is one of many turbulence models that depict turbulence, in power spectral density form.

In engineering mechanics, events may result from non-smoothness in the form of loss of contact, impact, or the onset of sliding-friction. An interesting example of such a mechanical system is a wheel whose center of mass does not coincide with its geometric center. An eccentric wheel may evolve in three distinct phases: roll without slip, roll with slip, and hop. Therefore, this paper seeks to explore and compare supervised learning methods for phase identification (i.e., roll, slip, and hop) in simulated data from a driven eccentric wheel. The mechanics of a torque driven wheel on a flat surface are derived through an augmented Lagrangian formulation and Coulomb friction is adopted to model transverse contact forces. To accommodate for non-smoothness, the system is broken down in complementary sub-problems and the simulation is conducted using event-based methods. The simulated data is then used to train a Naive Bayes classifier, a Support Vector Machine (SVM), and an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier. Lastly, the methods as well as their performance, merits, and drawbacks are discussed in detail.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Automotive Engineering']"

The next problem is to make the path curvature smooth, boundedness and limit its rate of change with design restrictions of the robot. If one tries to solve these problems directly and simultaneously, he will need to perform such cumbersome calculations that cannot be done in real-time mode. We propose to simplify and automate the generation of planar paths for a wheeled robot in this study by splitting the solution into two stages. At the first stage, we construct a primitive path as a planar polyline. Its segments connect the control points and ensure the working scenario executes safely. At the second stage, we solve the problem of smoothing the polyline joints without any geometric calculations. The proposed solution uses a dynamic generator constructed as a copy of the equations describing the movement of the center of mass of the wheeled platform. To imitate the robot’s control actions, we synthesize the generator’s corrective actions using the decomposition and S-shaped feedbacks. This approach ensures that the robot’s design restrictions on velocity, acceleration, and control torques are met. Also, the output variables of the generator simulate the coordinates of the robot’s center of mass. Thus, these variables will generate a naturally smoothed path with an acceptable curvature under tracking the coordinates of the reference non-smooth route.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Mechatronics']"

Control of flow means a slight shift in flow structure by means of active or passive methods that serve a preferably significant aerodynamic advantage. The aim of this study is to predict flow behavior over an airfoil under the effect of a plasma actuator; an extensive numerical investigation on a symmetric airfoil with a plasma actuator’s effect over it has been conducted using Ansys Fluent tool. Experimental data from NASA turbulent flow for NACA0012 is used as a benchmark and validated using the Spalart–Allmaras RANS model. User Defined Functions (UDF) with plasma source term are defined in C language which numerically simulates the Lorentz force over the airfoil which in turn is due to the effect of plasma actuators. Aerodynamic coefficients like Drag, Lift coefficients, and flow field are compared and the effect on the Lift/Drag ratio is evaluated in the presence of the plasma actuator’s effect. This is indicated by the change in drag coefficient which is reduced by 13% and the lift coefficient increased by 1.2%. To evaluate the acoustics of the airfoil, Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings (Fw-H) integral method is used, Sound Pressure Level (SPL) is compared in Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) with frequency domain, and the SPL is used to compare the effect of plasma actuator on acoustics.

The results show that a thermal shock with a rapid rise and subsequent rapid decrease in the contact temperature is generated in the subsurface layers. The frictional power intensity generates a high temperature rise, leading to the austenitization of the subsurface material. Consequently, the plastic flow is generated in the subsurface layer under the high shear stress, and the resulting plastic strain energy generates a further temperature increase.

However, most models use supervised methods while others use unsupervised methods, with less effective outcomes than supervised learning methods. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel level set loss function for unsupervised tasks and incorporates it with the Active Contour loss for supervised tasks. Besides, since previously introduced deep learning models generate less accurate results due to the intensity inhomogeneity issues and the often presence of low-intensity contrast tissues in infant brain segmentation, we propose a new convolutional neural network model to alleviate this problem. Instead of binary segmentation, our proposed loss entitles our model to segment multiple classes with promising outcomes. The proposed technique is utilized to segment neonatal brain magnetic resonance images into four non-overlap regions. The iSeg-2017 challenge, which offers a collection of neonatal brain magnetic resonance images from different sites, is used to evaluate our proposed process.

Due to the obvious innumerable sources of environmental uncertainty, estimating earthquake damage to buildings remains a difficult task. A variety of factors influence the severity of earthquake-induced building damage, such as amplitude, proximity to geographic centre, geological features and compliance with building reliability. Examining the damage rate of concrete structural system is critical for acknowledging the maintenance need avoiding the level of damage during the next catastrophic event. With this incentive, this paper discusses the significance of building damage characteristics in predicting building damage grade. The building earthquake damage dataset with 27 building attributes with 762,106 building damage details from KAGGLE warehouse is used in the execution analysis to determine the grade of damage. The earthquake damage dataset is preprocessed with missing values estimation, categorical feature encoding and feature scaling. The dataset with all 26 features is applied to all the classifiers to grade the damage with and without components scaling and the performance is analysed cross validating the training and testing data with 80:20, 70:30 and 60:40. The dataset is minimized with 10 linear discriminant components and then applied to all the classifiers to grade the damage with and without components scaling and the performance is analysed with cross validating the training and testing data with 80:20, 70:30 and 60:40. The scripting is written in Python and implemented with Anaconda Navigator, and the outcome shows that the random forest classifier is exhibiting 92% of accuracy after feature scaling and giving 96% of accuracy with 10 component LDA reduced dataset before and after feature scaling.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence']"

A set of observables is discovered to represent the nonlinear attitude dynamics on SO (3) using an infinite-dimensional linear system. With the assumption of low angular velocities, a finite-dimensional linear system is obtained by removing the high-order terms. An attitude control synthesis method is developed on the basis of the linear optimal control algorithm for the reduced linear system. The proposed controller design method is compared with some classical nonlinear optimal controllers to show its advantages. Also, the leaderless attitude synchronization problem is solved with the help of the reduced linear system and the well-studied linear multi-agent system theory. Furthermore, a possible solution to the case with a high angular velocity is provided. Simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the theory.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics']"

Recently, increasing environmental awareness has led scientists and practitioners to find solutions to reduce the emission gases that cause environmental pollution. These environmental concerns are taken into account in the solution of the green vehicle routing problem, a variant of the vehicle routing problem. For this reason, it has become a frequently studied subject in the literature in recent years. The Modified Cuckoo Search Algorithm, a swarm-based optimization approach, was used in this study to provide a solution to the green vehicle routing problem.

The paper shows that with an asymmetric form of the initial curvature in the region of positive axial forces, there are zones of proximity of the frequency branches corresponding to the second symmetric and the first asymmetric oscillation modes. The proposed configuration of the oscillation excitation and output signal pickup electrodes makes it possible, with the help of a feedback loop, to stabilize the oscillation amplitude at the required level according to the working (third) symmetric form and, at the same time, measure the oscillation amplitude associated with the change in the value of the measured component of the external acceleration according to the asymmetric form. The effect of energy exchange between the symmetric and asymmetric modes of the sensitive element can be used as the basis for the development of a new subclass of high-precision resonant sensors with amplitude pickup of the output signal. The parametric studies of the nonlinear statics and dynamics of free oscillations of the sensing element have shown a high level of potentially achievable accuracy of measurements of the external acceleration.","['Engineering', 'Nanotechnology and Microengineering', 'Mechatronics', 'Machinery and Machine Elements']"

One of the ways to reduce energy consumption is the use of air split-conditioner heat pumps (“air-to-air”) in heating systems of buildings, which use 1 kW of electricity from the network to transport up to 5 kW of thermal energy from outdoor air to indoor air. Heat pumps of air split-conditioners are power equipment that needs to improve their operating modes, which is possible through a detailed study of their work and an objective assessment of the degree of their energy excellence. The energy perfection of air split-conditioner heat pumps can best be established only on the basis of an analysis of their exergy efficiency. And this allowed substantiating the relevance of such a study, which will establish energy-saving operating conditions with relatively high exergy efficiency of existing heat pumps air split-conditioners. For this purpose, the author's innovative mathematical model of analysis of the operation of single-stage freon heat pumps of air split-conditioners by exergy method is used in the article. Energy-saving operating conditions have been set, i.e. indoor air consumption on the condenser of the operating heat pump of the air split-conditioner from “Mitsubishi Electric” firm with a standard heat capacity of 3200 W on R32 refrigerant depending on the indoor air temperature.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Sustainable Development', 'Renewable and Green Energy']"

Resilient production systems are needed to meet these challenges. The matrix production is such a system. It offers degrees of freedom in terms of operation sequence flexibility and work distribution flexibility through redundantly used resources. For the material supply this is a challenge in planning. The material must be supplied in a cost-efficient manner and without shortages. To increase planning quality, a method for selecting the least expensive material supply strategy is developed. Depending on consumption, constraints of space, and supply framework conditions, different strategies are advantageous for each material. The developed method requires three steps. First, required data for step 2 and step 3 is collected. In step 2, standardized process blocks combine to describe a company-specific material supply strategy. The approach is company-independent and added by cost functions to the process blocks. Through the cost functions applied to the process blocks the costs of a supply strategy is achieved. As material can be supplied in alternative ways, multiple expected costs for supplying arise. As only one supply strategy needs to be selected, step 3 is necessary. It uses the branch-and-cut algorithm on the mathematical description of the logistic selection problem to find the cost-minimal configuration of supply strategies. As the problem is in the context of matrix production, several conditions and requirements need to be included in the selection process. The result is the assignment of a material supply strategy to each material while minimizing the costs.","['Engineering', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering', 'Computer-Aided Engineering (CAD, CAE) and Design']"

However, this fundamental assumption is not always satisfied in practice, e.g., due to changing environments, sample selection bias, privacy concerns, or high labeling costs. Transfer learning (TL) relaxes this assumption and allows us to learn under distribution shift. Classical TL methods typically rely on importance weighting —a predictor is trained based on the training losses weighted according to the importance (i.e., the test-over-training density ratio). However, as real-world machine learning tasks are becoming increasingly complex, high-dimensional, and dynamical, novel approaches are explored to cope with such challenges recently. In this chapter, after introducing the foundation of TL based on importance weighting, we review recent advances on joint and dynamic importance-predictor estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a method of causal mechanism transfer that incorporates causal structure in TL.

As a rule, a UAV swarm is modeled by a graph that displays information about the equipment installed on the aircraft, the topology of the swarm, and the connections between the equipment. Destructive effects on the UAV swarm are modeled by removing vertices from the graph. The feasibility of the tasks of the UAV swarm is determined on the basis of estimates of the connectedness of the vertices, the modified graph, corresponding to the necessary equipment. The advantage of such approaches is the possibility of obtaining the reliability characteristics of the UAV swarm equipment of a given configuration when performing the assigned tasks. But, at the same time, the computational complexity of such approaches significantly depends on the topology of the graph, including the number of vertices and the connections between them. The article considers the issue of building a model of the effects of atmospheric influences (environmental factors) on UAVs based on fuzzy sets. Atmospheric influences of the external environment include wind loads, atmospheric precipitation and temperature conditions of the external environment, which are presented as fuzzy numbers with triangular membership functions. The models take into account possible atmospheric impacts and make it possible to determine the probability of damage to a group of UAVs. The computational complexity of the proposed approach significantly depends on the number of qualitative estimates of atmospheric impacts on a group of UAVs. Based on the developed models, the values of the probability of damage to a group of UAVs as a result of various atmospheric influences are calculated.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

Here we report a novel hybrid method to extract and classify the urban wastewaters (caused mainly by eutrophication) from 4-band high resolution imagery using a multi-step statistical approach. First, the MTSUWI (Modified Two-Step Urban Water Index) algorithm is presented for extracting the urban water automatically, and the Kappa Coefficient comes up to 0.92. Second, using the Minimum Message Length Criterion-Expectation Maximization algorithm (MML-EM), the histogram of the water-masked 1st principal component image was screened into two subpopulations, which are mainly a re-flection of the existing background of the waters, rather than the pollution. Third, the water floating matters (most of them are green algae) is selected as an indirect interpretation key of the polluted wastewaters, and by gradually reducing the interpretation target area, pixels containing green alga were enhanced and then extracted in the brightness image. Fourth, any river reach containing at least one patch of green alga is labeled as “polluted”, otherwise they are labeled as “clean/fresh”, and finally, eight black-and-odorous wastewaters in the study area were selected out, which are consistent with literatures and observations from the field.

Thus, rationale of manuscript is toward classifying the most barriers in SSCM and to rank them in favor of effective SSCM strategy. To categorize the main barriers in SSCM, fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) is used. Used for giving keep score to completely different issue, a team of three consultants was completed. All consultants have quite 10 years of information in space of supply chain management. Requirement of top management support, lack of SSCM project coaching, and learning and lack of tactical designing and implementation have emerged as prime three barriers in implementation of systems in textile industries. Findings imply that for successful SSCM, top management ought to be terribly ancillary for taking completely different initiatives, coaching programs, etc. Organizations ought to try and improve overall performance of textile business productivity. These findings are extremely helpful for professionals from textile producing sector in implementing effective SSCM system.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Robotics and Automation']"

It addresses the lateral harmonic forcing, with spatial dependencies, of a two-segment damped Timoshenko beam. In the series, frequency response functions (FRFs) were determined for segmented structures, such as rods and beams, using analytic and numerical approaches. These structures are composed of stacked cells, which are made of different materials and may have different geometric properties. The goal is the determination of frequency response functions (FRFs). Two approaches are employed. The first approach uses displacement differential equations for each segment, where boundary and interface continuity conditions are used to determine the constants involved in the solutions. Then the response, as a function of forcing frequency, can be obtained. This procedure is unwieldy, and determining particular integrals can become difficult for arbitrary spatial variations. The second approach uses logistic functions to model segment discontinuities. The result is a system of partial differential equations with variable coefficients. Numerical solutions are developed with the aid of MAPLE® software. For free/fixed boundary conditions, spatially constant force, and viscous damping, excellent agreement is found between the methods. The numerical approach is then used to obtain FRFs for cases including spatially varying load.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Complexity', 'Materials Science, general', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation']"

This lean manufacturing system is known as the Toyota production system. Kaizen is one of the lean manufacturing techniques which means “continuous improvement”. This technique can be used at any place like home, industry, etc. Its small improvements which lead us to get maximum output (Bellgran et al. in Cost driven Green Kaizen in pharmaceutical production—creating positive engagement for environmental improvements, pp 1219–1214, 2019). It is a zero investment or minimum investment tool. The approach of the research includes a literature review about lean manufacturing techniques specially kaizen. This tool can be used in various manufacturing industries. Design methodology In this study, a qualitative survey of 38 North Indian manufacturing industries is collected and analysed using Cronbach, co-variance, correlation, regression, and t-test are conducted for developing relationships between input and output parameters. Findings The outcome of this study indicates that the implementation of kaizen is useful in eliminating MURA, 3M-MUDA, and MURI which means inconsistency, inconvenience, and wastage (Kumar in Int J Math Eng Manag Sci 4:452–459, 2019). There are some hardware and software enablers for kaizen. Hardware enablers include policies, essential rules, and institutional management. Software enablers include training, incentives, etc. Proper implementation of kaizen can improve quality reduce complaints, etc. The industries implemented kaizen more than 2 years gets the best outcomes with better productivity, waste elimination, cost reduction, better quality. Research limitation The chosen approach for this research study was limited to only the manufacturing organizations in North India. Practical implications This study will help the manufacturers to enhance the performance of their particular firms using kaizen implementation, especially in the countries which are developing. From the findings of study, academicians and practitioners would easily focus on the various issues related to continuous improvement of firm apart from operational measures.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Robotics and Automation']"

These combinatorial optimization problems are usually solved using operations research approaches. Despite their undoubted assets, the proposed solutions remain usually impractical for the end-user in a manufacturing context. In this context, this work investigates the Permutation Flow Shop Problem (PFSP) which consists in finding a set of jobs sequence on pre-set machines that minimizes all the jobs completion time, such as all jobs pass through all machines in the same order. For the PFSF, a graphic user interface is developed based on a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model. Numerical experimentation was conducted to find accurate parameters’ values combination using non-parametric statistical tests.

We implement the leader-follower formation type here, where the flock has to navigate in a workspace cluttered with obstacles with respect to its leader to reach its pre-defined targets. In our case, the obstacles will be spherical fixed obstacles and the moving aircrafts in the swarm itself becomes the obstacles for all the other members. This needs to be avoided to successfully achieve the task. The flock navigates the environment in its pre-defined formation and moves towards its target. In the event of an obstacle, the flock splits and rejoins later in a safer location, regaining the desired shape. A set of nonlinear acceleration-based controllers using the Lyapunov-based Control Scheme are designed to achieve this task successfully. The controllers presented will guarantee the UAVs coordinate their motion in a well-planned manner and make sure the aircraft converge to their desired target while avoiding obstacles intersecting their path. The computer-generated simulations of a number of virtual scenarios have been looked at where different predefined formations of the flock have been designed. These simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed nonlinear acceleration control laws, revealing the simplicity and effectiveness of the control technique used. The paper finally ends with a conclusion and future work recommendations in this area.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Such rolling pairs provide the advantage of being friction and clearance free. In this paper, circle-on-circle and circle-on-line type of rolling pairs have been explored. This arrangement introduces three additional design variables to study the continuous change in the shape of the coupler curve of a conventional 4-bar mechanism. For a given input rotation at the crank, the mechanism does not have a closed-form solution for its configuration. However, providing input rotation at the rolling link allows easy derivation of a closed-form solution for both branches of the configuration. The tracing of the coupler curves is done for arbitrary radius ratios for the rolling link and choice of coupler point on the coupler link. A computer program has been written to study and visualize the coupler curves and its properties; the program not only finds the closure configurations but also identifies the situations of non-closure. Illustrative examples show variety and complexity of coupler curves which are not achieved in linkages. Although these coupler curves of mechanisms with rolling pair are transcendental in nature, the velocity states of the systems are easily derivable. Since the point of contact of the rolling pair is the instantaneous centre for the rolling link with respect to the ground, the velocity of the coupler point is determined using Kennedy's theorem. This helps in characterizing the occurrence of cusps in the coupler curves. The paper presents the geometric conditions for components, crunodes and cusps in the coupler curve with illustrative examples.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics']"

In particular, the paper aims to exploit PDs for SHM and damage characterization of the built environment, at the structural scale, in operational conditions (i.e., without input sources). The reasons behind this study rely on the possibility to use PDs to emulate very complex structural behaviors effortlessly, using PDs as a paradigm to build low fidelity structural models of real systems. In the present paper, new features to characterize the damage (i.e., to detect, locate, and quantify it) are proposed thanks to a special definition of the peridynamic theory written in discrete form. These features are the Bond Extremity Acceleration (BEA) and Bond Extremity Velocity (BEV) conjectures, which are obtained by discretizing a system with the Bond Based PDs and using a micro-viscoelastic constitutive law at the bond level. Moreover, the authors show how the proposed peridynamic parameters are theoretically estimable with very robust techniques already used in SHM, such as the Stochastic Subspace Identification (SSI) algorithms. The considerations reported in the paper are verified with numerical (virtual) models. The paper concludes that PDs can be used to easily parametrize the built environment opening new research possibilities on the use of PDs for civil SHM. Additionally, the proposed BEA proves to be a very scalable and general parameter to be monitored in real systems (providing information on the presence, the location, and the amount of damage), this also due to its physical based meaning and the straightforward method of extraction in operational conditions.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Structural Materials', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-04086-3_5,en,System Identification of Geometrically Nonlinear Structures Using Reduced-Order Models,OriginalPaper,"System identification of engineering structures is an established area in the structural dynamics research community. It is often used to characterise certain physical properties of a structure using the data measured from it. For structures exhibiting nonlinear behaviour, physics-based approaches are used where a form of nonlinearity is synthesised and parameters are estimated using the data, or probabilistic approaches are investigated to tackle the model uncertainty of structures. However, to build reliable models, the estimated parameters from the measurement data must reflect the true underlying physics of the structure. Therefore, Reduced-Order Models (ROMs) can be used as the surrogate models, where the nonlinear parameters of the ROMs are having a meaningful relation with the physical parameters of the system. In this work, we propose nonlinear system identification in the context of using some recently developed ROMs which account for the kinetic energy of unmodelled modes. It is shown how ROMs may be used to represent low-order, accurate models for system identification. Identification of a nonlinear system with strong modal coupling is demonstrated, using simulated data, while the estimated ROM response shows good convergence with that of full order system. Similarly, the estimated parameters match with those of directly computed ROM.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Automotive Engineering']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-16684-6_22,en,IV-FEC: Information Volume-Based Fuzzy Evidential Classifier,OriginalPaper,"Classification based on fuzzy set theory and evidence theory has attracted much attention. However, traditional fuzzy classifiers and evidential classifiers may encounter two issues when facing data with high uncertainty. For one thing, the knowledge represented by the classifier may be in conflict, making classification difficult. For the other thing, most classifiers only consider one type of uncertainty. Hence, in this paper, information volume-based fuzzy evidential classifier (IV-FEC) is proposed by considering both the fuzziness and the total uncertainty (TU) of the classification problem. IV-FEC incorporates fuzzy information volume (FIV) and evidential information volume (EIV) for conflict management under the different types of uncertainty. FIV and EIV respectively estimate the fuzziness of the Gaussian membership degree of the samples and the TU for each attribute. An FIV and EIV-based discounting technique is utilized to modify the mass functions in order to manage conflicts in evidence combination and improve classification performance. The proposed IV-FEC is applied in target classification and verified based on several experiments. The results show that IV-FEC has a better classification accuracy compared with the existing models.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Computational Intelligence']"

Previously, clinical data was used for heart disease diagnosis. Advance technology led to improvement in deep learning (DL) and optimization algorithms that use image data to classify and predict heart diseases. DL eliminates data pre-processing as in machine learning (ML), to scan and search features that correlate and combine them to enable faster learning. DL requires huge data to perform accurately.

They do not assume that the input data, possibly given by measurements, are precise; 2. They were experimentally shown to have a better capability than conventional singleton fuzzy logic systems to deal with noise. If there is prior knowledge regarding the uncertainty in the input data, e.g., if the measurement error is known, then one is in a position to model non-singleton input fuzzy sets directly, e.g., using intervals. Otherwise, one usually chooses certain types of input type-1 or type-2 fuzzy sets and attempts to estimate their parameters. Usually, one assumes that the training data are noise free. In this paper, we first consider the scenario where both the training and the testing data are corrupted by Gaussian noise with zero mean with an unknown variance. In this case, we smooth the training data using a statistical method before generating the rules. The input fuzzy sets in the testing phase are interval type-2 Gaussians that are centered at the filtered singleton inputs. We propose a method to estimate their parameters. This method also can be applied to the scenario where the testing data are corrupted by arbitrary (stable or varying) levels of noise and the training data is either noisy or noise free.

The results of the dispersion analysis are confirmed by independent finite element simulations, which show that time-harmonic forces applied in proximity of the interface generate waves that are localised at the interface and do not propagate inside the bulk of the medium. In addition, these waves mainly propagate in one specific direction, that can be predicted from the dispersion curves and that can be reversed by changing the direction of rotation of the spinners. The model described here is an alternative to other elastic structures proposed in the literature and, considering its tuning properties, may be useful for different engineering applications including wave guiding, vibration isolation and energy harvesting.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis']"

Machine learning techniques, along with statistical analysis and data mining, are one of the most important ways to study student performance and success. This paper aims at forecasting students second-year outcomes, to deduce if they are at risk of getting academically excluded or will proceed to register for the following academic year. This way, students who are at risk can be provided with support to avoid being academically excluded. Six predictive models, namely the K-nearest neighbours, random forest, decision trees, naive Bayes, logistic regression and multilayer perceptron, were trained. The random forest proved to be a good classification model amongst the others with an accuracy of 83%, precision of 83%, recall of 82% and an F1 score of 83%. The significance of this study is to promote student success initiatives in higher learning institutions to enhance throughput rates.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

While digitalization and ‘big data’ solutions have enhanced practice across many sectors, the construction industry has failed to capitalize on such advances. Fragmentation along project value chains, project complexity and uncertainty, transience of involved stakeholders, and, often, remote and harsh environments have obstructed the development of a standardized digital solution in construction at both the industry and corporate levels. As a consequence, construction data remain noisy, fragmented, and heterogeneous (e.g. both subjective and observational, both structured and unstructured). These types of data form natural barriers for use in data-driven applications, inhibiting the use of data-driven decision-support systems in construction. Aimed at bridging raw construction data with real-time data-driven applications, this research reviewed state-of-the-art information technologies in construction literature and industrial practice to identify three challenges limiting digitalization in construction: (1) heavy manual data manipulation when pre-processing raw construction data for project-level decision-support, (2) low implementation of machine learning to appropriately deal with the flood of available construction data, and (3) a lack of means for fusing heterogeneous information derived from various sources for data-driven simulation in real-time. Following the exploration and adaptation of a number of interdisciplinary methods, this research addressed the identified challenges by providing a novel roadmap for improving the transformation of fragmented construction data into reliable, real-time, and data-driven decision-support.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

A statistical learning machine (SLM) is the algorithm, function, model, or rule, that learns such a process; and machine learning (ML) is the conventional name of this field. ML and its applications are ubiquitous in the modern world. Systems such as Automatic target recognition (ATR) in military applications, computer aided diagnosis (CAD) in medical imaging, DNA microarrays in genomics, optical character recognition (OCR), speech recognition (SR), spam email filtering, stock market prediction, etc., are few examples and applications for ML; diverse fields but one theory. In particular, ML has gained a lot of attention in the field of cyberphysical security, especially in the last decade. It is of great importance to this field to design detection algorithms that have the capability of learning from security data to be able to hunt threats, achieve better monitoring, master the complexity of the threat intelligence feeds, and achieve timely remediation of security incidents. The field of ML can be decomposed into two basic subfields: construction and assessment . We mean by construction designing or inventing an appropriate algorithm that learns from the input data and achieves a good performance according to some optimality criterion. We mean by assessment attributing some performance measures to the constructed ML algorithm, along with their estimators, to objectively assess this algorithm. Construction and assessment of a ML algorithm require familiarity with different other fields: probability, statistics, matrix theory, optimization, algorithms, and programming, among others. To help practitioners, specially those of cyberphysical security, to understand the theoretical foundations of ML, before they delve into whole books, we compile the very basics of the first of these two subfields ( construction ) in this chapter. In addition to explaining the mathematical foundations of the field, we emphasize the intuitive explanation and concepts.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The central aim of this study is to identify system parameter ranges for which pendulum rotations exist. The external harmonic excitation amplitude and frequency, and the difference in pendulums lengths are the system parameters which have been varied thresholds. Bifurcation analysis has been performed for the identification of values beyond which rotations exist, and the study of corresponding bifurcation points has been conducted with computational tool ABESPOL, developed at the Centre for Applied Dynamics Research (CADR) of the University of Aberdeen [ 3 ]. Direct simulations and one-parameter continuation analysis were performed with ABESPOL and some results were corroborated with direct numerical integration in Matlab, based on a Runge-Kutta algorithm. One parameter continuation results showed complex bifurcation scenarios for antiphase rotatory motions, presenting evidence of existence and form of representation. Further results showed that pendulum rotations, in phase and antiphase, co-exist with oscillatory motions. Therefore, the basins of attraction have been computed, enabling attractors to be targeted so as to enable antiphase rotatory motion.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis']"

However, sometimes, several unfavorable conditions like bad weather, technical and mechanical failures, air traffic control, and human errors create a big problem for airport authorities and causing flight delays. Therefore, considering these unfavorable situations, this present paper suggests a multi-objective optimization model of airport gate reassignment for these delayed flights with three novel objectives, namely time inconsistency, space inconsistency, and economic loss value. Also, to address the impreciseness of information, fuzzy concept has been introduced in the model. Furthermore, the formulated model has been illustrated with a numerical example. The solution is performed by the traditional fuzzy programming technique and genetic algorithm to obtain the results of the optimization problem. Finally, the results indicate the maximum financial benefit of airport authorities with the minimization of other objectives.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Optimization', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory']"

Throughput of the network increases when using the D2D communication, and the increase is evident in the local communication, which is done through the resources of reused cellular phone users. The cellular user (CU) resource is reused by the device-to-device pair so that they create interference between them and thus result in a decline in throughput. So, in this paper, we proposed the PSO and GA based on a scheme to allocate resources for device-to-device connections in the fifth generation networks. In this scheme, initially and based on the algorithm PSO—which is based on the RA of the 5G network, we describe the numerical results which can be performed sufficient in the obtain of this system. As for the Genetic algorithm (GA), chromosomes are generated at the beginning, so that each chromosome contains a gene. In addition, for all chromosomes that are generated the function of their fitness is measured, and then the best chromosomes are selected according to their fitness values after that, we can applying crossover and mutation to two points of the crossover chromosomes. The base station, depending on the fitness value, allocates the resource block.

Recent works have shown the benefit of using artificially augmented data in deep machine learning applications. Especially in image processing augmentation algorithms, e.g., generative adversarial networks (GAN), conditional GANs, variational type of autoencoders, restricted Boltzmann machines, geometric transformations (translation, rotation, and scaling fractional linear Möbius transformation), mixing images, feature space augmentation, etc., are used as methods to solve the problem of limited data space. Furthermore, the classical inverse problem, e.g., reconstruction of images from incomplete data, is still of high interest. There are several studies where the use of deep learning methods in solving inverse problems has shown good results. These studies have been focused on image denoising by, e.g., stacked denoising autoencoders (SDA), removing noisy patterns from images, and image super-resolution by using special type of deep convolutional networks.

This routing technique observes and introduces a latest algorithms that goals to optimize the route selection of Internet site online traffic road congestion in actual-time primarily based mostly on the ant colony optimization algorithm and VANET communication system. The VANET is used as a communication era a good way to exchanging the routing table information among several vehicles and routes.

To extract useful information from huge data, data analysis is required. For analysis, data has to be shared with a third party called data analyst. Sharing data with data analyst introduces the risk of privacy for individuals whose sensitive information is present in the shared data. Privacy is the right of an individual, so it needs to be maintained while sharing the data with a third party. There are many privacy-preserving algorithms available. k-anonymization is one of the most popular and traditional privacy-preserving methods. It modifies data to protect an individual's sensitive information by disconnecting the link between an individual and its sensitive information. k-anonymization uses generalization and suppression tools to anonymize the data. Generalization replaces specific values of attributes with general values, and suppression deletes unmatched values of attributes. There are many existing single table anonymization algorithms. The proposed work presents how a single table anonymization algorithm can be applied on multi-relation dataset. It also discusses the problems encountered when single table anonymization algorithms are used for the multi-relation dataset.

The permittivity between the polyelectrolyte layer and electrolyte solution are taken differently, which generates ion partitioning. The surface charge density of the nanopore is negative, while the charge density in the polyelectrolyte layer depends on the pH values and concentration in aqueous solution. The present model of the electroosmotic flow through pH -regulated polyelectrolyte layer is considered Nernst–Planck equation for the ionic species, Navier–Stokes equation in modified form for flow and Poisson equation for potential distribution. These governing equations are solved numerically on a staggered grid system by finite volume method. This article investigates the importance of different dielectric permittivity, ionic strength, pH values, softness, and the charged density of the nanopore wall. The permittivity ratio is defined by the permittivity of polyelectrolyte layer and electrolyte solution. The average electroosmotic flow decreases with the permittivity ratio. The increase in the softness parameter decreases the flow rate. The ion partitioning contributes to the penetration effect of counter ions in the polyelectrolyte layer, which decreases the body force, and hence affects the electroosmotic flow rate.","['Mathematics', 'Mathematical Applications in Computer Science', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Mathematical Modeling and Industrial Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Optimization']"

The lower boundary of the porous bed is subjected to a steady-state heat flux. Furthermore, the conductivity of the plate is usually different from the conductivity of the porous sheet. We considered three cases of gravity field variations: (a) linear, (b) parabolic, and (a) cubic. The analytical solutions are achieved by perturbation technique for small values of the gravity parameter, conductivity, and depth of the plate. It is obtained that the gravity parameter, depth ratio, and conductivity ratio of the plate are to hold up the beginning of convective motion. It is also found that the system is more consistent for the linear variation and more inconsistent for the cubic variation.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Mechatronics', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Energy Storage', 'Materials Engineering']"

For constructing an as-built Building Information Models (BIM) from captured laser-scanned datasets, the segmentation process precedes modeling, which provides a baseline to be traced for obtaining 3D models from point clouds. For the segmentation process, a clustering algorithm can be effectively applied so that it can group the points having similar features without predefined criteria which, in turn, segments can be easily separated from the entire scene. Amongst various types of clustering algorithms, Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) was developed as a density-based and hierarchical clustering algorithm which provides a simplified tree of significant clusters. This algorithm has several distinct advantages over other clustering algorithms: (1) avoids “flat” (i.e. non-hierarchical) labeling of data objects, (2) automatically simplifies the hierarchy into the most significant clusters, and (3) requires a single input parameter (i.e. minimum number of points) for density threshold. However, this algorithm has an overall computation time complexity represented as a quadratic form (i.e., $${\text{O}}\left( {dn^2 } \right)$$ O d n 2 ) which suffers from the computational efficiency issue especially for massive amounts of data such as those found in 3D point clouds. To ease the applicability of HDBSCAN to Scan-to-BIM applications, this research aims to parallelize major time-consuming components of HDBSCAN algorithm. OpenMP interface was adopted for thread parallelization and parallel efficiency was measured by calculating speedup and efficiency from strong and weak scaling results.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-15758-5_28,en,Optimal LQR Control for Longitudinal Vibrations of an Elastic Rod Actuated by Distributed and Boundary Inputs,OriginalPaper,"We consider a vibrating system consisting of a thin rectilinear elastic rod actuated by external loads applied at the ends as well as by a normal force, which is distributed piecewise constantly in space. Such a force may be implemented by piezoelectric actuators. The intervals of constancy of this normal force are equal in length, and the force value on each of these sections is considered as an independent control input. We study the longitudinal motions of the rod and the means of control optimization. Based on the eigenmode decomposition, it is shown in the case of uniform rod that the original continuous system is split into several infinite vibrating subsystems each of which is controlled by a certain linearly independent combination of control inputs. It follows that if any of these combinations is taken equal to zero, then the corresponding subsystem becomes uncontrollable. Next, an optimal control problem on a finite time horizon is considered, where the terminal mechanical energy of the rod and energy losses in the control circuit are minimized with some weighting coefficients. We show that for a fixed number of actuators distributed along the rod, approximation of the problem is reduced to the design of linear-quadratic regulators. An example of a uniform rod is presented where finite expressions for the optimal control functions are obtained. Amplitudes of controlled and affected but not minimized modes are derived for approximated suboptimal control.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis']"

However, non-linearity, the requirement of extremely fine meshing, and/or large-scale simulations make numerical crack prediction a tedious task with this family of models. Such problems demand enormous computational resources. Under a sequential computing framework, these lead to extremely slow computations with non-feasible computer processing times. As a remedy, domain decomposition approaches that facilitate parallel computing can subdue these issues and significantly decrease computational time and memory. This contribution discusses and compares two ways of setting up domain decomposition for phase-field models under a distributed computing framework. Notably, in the context of parallel computing, a monolithic strategy set up via the vectorial finite elements is compared to a staggered finite element strategy for a hybrid phase-field model. A detailed comparison of performance, scalability, and efficiency on thousands of parallel processors is established for a large-scale fracture mechanics problem with millions of unknowns.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Structural Materials', 'Sustainable Development', 'Mathematical Modeling and Industrial Mathematics']"

Among many approaches, this study focuses on a Bayesian OSP algorithm optimized using the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) – a blackbox algorithm for continuous problems. The increase in the number of CMA-ES variants warrants the non-trivial selection problem. Nonetheless, it is difficult to say if such a step has been well-conducted in the investigated SHM literature. Hence, this study aimed to improve the existing OSP framework by adding an offline algorithm selection methodology and to demonstrate the framework’s application to buildings. Application to the ASCE benchmark structure showed that the discrete implementation of CMA-ES outperforms a discrete reformulation that used binomial sampling. OSP results were also found to agree with existing literature. Furthermore, case studies quantify that for an undamaged structure, sensor placement that is well-distributed according to the location of the columns and stiffeners gives high-quality OMA results. For damaged structures, sensors should be placed near the damaged region, and failure to do so showed a reduction of MAC value by 0.1. Lastly, with insight from industry research of the Philippine SHM landscape, these conclusions were found to be potential recommendations to improve the current developing practice compared to the international state-of-the-art.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

The coupled system of dynamic differential equations describes the beam-foundation structure subjected to distributed forces travelling along a beam. The upper beam, although arbitrarily distinguished, is not separated from the whole beam. This layer is considered as a vibration generator for the whole beam longitudinal axis. An assumption of nonlinear foundation stiffness is introduced as an important extension compared to existing solutions. This nonlinear system is solved by using a hybrid method based on the Adomian’s decomposition combined with a wavelet based approximation. Although description of the problem was already presented before, a new solution along with computational examples are important contribution to the field and the main novelty of the paper. The theoretical parameters used in the analysis are taken from the literature and although being close to real structures they should be validated by experimental measurements. The aim of this parametrical study is to compare the new “beam inside beam” model with classical system of double-beam resting on nonlinear foundation.

However, the combination of mechanical metastructures and rotating axially symmetric systems - rotordynamics - is still a largely unexplored subject. In this work we propose the study of a simple rotor system with periodically attached resonators. Its dynamical behavior is investigated using the system’s transfer matrix. The gyroscopic effects acting both on the rotor and the resonators create interesting phenomena such as polarization of the whirl modes and ‘invisibility’ effects. A rainbow-type arrangement of resonators is also explored for translational and flexural resonators, showing good enhancement of attenuation performance. The interaction between resonators modes and rotor modes is explored and the impacts on vibration transmissibility is evaluated. The translational resonators showed significantly superior attenuation performance, both in amplitude and bandwidth. However, unique effects such as polarized invisibility and speed dependent bandgap formation where only achievable for the flexural resonators.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis']"

Due to the existence of strong nonlinearity from squeeze film dampers and ball bearings, it is often very time consuming to evaluate the vibration of the rotor excited by unbalanced mass, which makes efficient and reliable modeling reduction is pivotal to rotordynamic analyses. In this paper, the nonlinear vibration and dynamical behavior of a twin-spool rotor assembly supported on bearings and squeeze film dampers with centralizing springs is investigated through the post-processed nonlinear Galerkin method. The rotor is spatially discretized with the finite element method, and the nonlinear governing equation of motion of the system is derived. To reduce the scale of the full-sized model, the post-processed nonlinear Galerkin method is employed to project the original system onto a low-dimensional sub-manifold with a relatively smaller number of degrees of freedom. The convergence of the nonlinear Galerkin method is verified through comparisons energy between the original and the reduced systems. The optimal choice of the number of master modes is determined to form the reduced model for nonlinear vibration analyses. Through the NGM the vibration of the system is solved, and the amplitude-frequency response, bifurcation and the Poincaré map are obtained to demonstrate the complexity in the rotor dynamics.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis']"

The assessment obtained by the Bonferroni mean (BM) can manifest the correlation among the arguments. In this study, the power average operator is fused with the Bonferroni mean under the interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy environment to develop some novel power Bonferroni mean operators such as the generalized interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy power Bonferroni mean (GIVIHFPBM) and the generalized interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy power geometric Bonferroni mean (GIVIHFPGBM).

We review this literature against a backdrop of structural inequity, academic capitalism, inequitable access to academic and social capital, and student agency. We point to larger forces and specific practices that contribute to social reproduction within the academy, as well as those that have potential to restructure training and scholarship within academic disciplines.

As transformations towards digital EPM are challenging, the objective of this paper is to develop a forward-looking maturity model to help companies digitalize their EPM. We apply a “zero-quartile” approach. In contrast to the best practices of top performing companies (“first quartile”), a zero-quartile defines the expected (collectively deemed best possible) state of a future EPM leveraging digital technologies. We employ the Rasch algorithm on data of a survey of 203 participants and based on a maturity model, we come up with four design guidelines to help companies digitalize their EPM. (1) A digital enterprise platform is the future single source of truth for planning, budgeting, and forecasting. Backing managers’ experience with data, it combines harmonized ERP outcomes with insights from market analyses, social media, and other sources. (2) Predictive analytics is the first opinion for planning, budgeting, and forecasting. Yet, managers have to learn to accept such outcomes so that they can focus more on irregularities. (3) Standard reports and analyses as well as standard comments will be automated. User-centricity is the “new” normal for a more natural working modus. (4) Managers should overcome their reluctance to work with data and start analyzing in a self-service fashion.

Using a systematic approach, these transport models are derived from the semiclassical Boltzmann equation by applying the method of moments. The drift-diffusion model is based on the first two moments of the Boltzmann equation, while hydrodynamic and energy transport models consider three or four moments. Within the framework of the diffusion approximation, the convective terms in the hydrodynamic models can be neglected, resulting in the much simpler diffusive energy transport models. A discussion of the physical assumptions needed for the validity of these models is given. In cases where the energy distribution is insufficiently described by a heated Maxwellian distribution, energy transport models give poor results. Based on the diffusion approximation, a six-moment model generalizing the energy transport model is presented. All model parameters can be extracted from fullband bulk Monte Carlo simulations. The six-moment model is applied for the simulation of devices with channel length in the deca-nanometer regime. Short-channel and hot-carrier effects for which the heated Maxwellian assumption introduces particularly large errors are studied. Comparing all models, it is demonstrated that the six-moment model can improve on the drift-diffusion and energy transport models.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Electronic Circuits and Devices', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation']"

A straight forward approach is to keep a track of each car. However, the state space of such a model increases very rapidly by increasing number of cars. Assuming that cars are of the same type, it suffices to model how the number of cars changes, which results in a significantly smaller state space. We assume that distributions of travel time are not Markovian. We approximate behaviour of non-Markovian system by a Markovian model in which distributions of travel time are approximated by Phase-type distributions. Our results showed that probability of non-empty zone does depend on travel time mean and not on the actual form of travel time distribution.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Past studies suggested that the use of integrated videos could lower the extraneous cognitive load of learners. However, it was not clear whether this benefit is produced from the closer spatial proximity between the two sources of information or the integration (rather than segmentation) of the two sources of information. The current study examined how spatial distance and integration of an instructor’s close-up video on PowerPoint slides reduce cognitive load when the material is low or high in terms of difficulty. Four conditions were formed by combining two levels of integration (high vs. low) and spatial proximity (high vs. low). Participants were randomly assigned to 1 out of the 4 conditions to watch one video of easy material and one video of difficult material in a counterbalanced order. Perceived mental effort and learning performance were measured for each condition. Results showed that there was a significant effect of task difficulty for both recall and transfer tests. Moreover, there was a two-way interaction with difficulty and spatial distance on the transfer test: When the material was difficult, participants performed poorer when the instructor was presented near the textual information than when she was presented further away. There was no effect of spatial distance when the material was easy. Future designers can consider customizing the online learning systems based on learners’ experience with the content and their familiarization with online technologies, as well as other factors to increase the motivation Motivation  of the learners.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

For the floating random walk (FRW) method, the pre-characterization approaches must be employed to accurately handle multi-dielectric structures. In this chapter, we improve the pre-characterization approach in Yu et al. ( 2013 ) by permitting the cubic transition domains to contain three or four dielectric layers. This results in the techniques of pre-characterizing and utilizing these multi-dielectric-layer transition cubes. Then, a unified pre-characterization scheme is proposed to suit arbitrary multi-layer dielectric profiles. It avoids the pre-characterization dependent on specified dielectric profile, and preserves high accuracy. Experiments on the test cases under actual manufacture technologies show that the improved pre-characterization approach averagely brings 13X speedup over the approach in Yu et al. ( 2013 ), with affordable memory overhead. The experiments also reveal the significant error caused by the dielectric homogenization approach in a commercial FRW solver. With the comparisons to other pre-characterization schemes, we finally show that the unified dielectric pre-characterization scheme exhibits the highest accuracy while costing the least memory usage, for test cases from IC and FPD design.","['Engineering', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation', 'Engineering Mathematics']"

Trustworthiness of AI results require very detailed and careful validation of the applied algorithms, as some errors and biases could reside deeply inside AI components, which might affect inclusiveness, equity, justice and irreversibly influence human lives. It is critical to detect them and to reduce their negative effect on AI users. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to bias detection. Using the Deep Learning (DL) models as examples of a broader scope of AI systems, we make the models self-detective of the underlying defects and biases. Our system looks ‘under the hood’ of AI-model components layer by layer, treating the neurons as similarity estimators – as we claim the main indicator of hidden defects and bias. In this paper, we report on the result of applying our self-detection approach to a Transformer DL model, and its Detection Transformer object detection (DETR) framework, introduced by Facebook AI Research (FAIR) team in 2020. Our approach automatically measures the weights and biases of transformer encoding layers to identify and eventually mitigate the sources of bias. This paper focuses on the measurement and visualization of the weights and biases of the DETR-model layers. The outcome of this research will be our implementation of a modernistic Bias Testing and Mitigation platform.

A modification of the Petrov–Galerkin method is applied to find numerically the eigenfrequencies and eigenforms of the rod when its surface is free of loads. According to this approach, local stress-strain and momentum-velocity relations are replaced by an integral equality. Approximate solution to the eigeproblem is based on polynomial semi-discretization of displacements and stresses: a finite-dimensional expansion in powers of two lateral coordinates is used. The rod’s motions are decomposed into independent groups of eigenmodes due to axial symmetry. Four of these groups are considered, namely, torsional, longitudinal, and two type of bending vibrations. At the lowest approximation order, the governing equations are reduced to two differential systems of fourth order for bending and two systems of second order for longitudinal and torsional motions.

They may affect the equilibrium of the internal environment. The relationship between physical exercise and muscle fatigue has particularly attracted attention, by many researchers for more than a century. Such a relationship is very complex and still needs further research. Human locomotion analysis is used extensively by physicians for pre-treatment analysis. In general, human locomotion can be defined as sequences of cyclic and repeated gestures. Previous analyses have proved the cyclostationarity behavior of vertical ground reaction forces (VGRF) recorded during walking and running. In this article, the Random Slope Modulation (RSM) is introduced as a new model for characterizing cyclostationarity. This model presents the impact of random slope variation on the cyclic spectrum of the signal and, hence, it lends itself the ability to extract information about the cyclostationary properties and structure of the signals in question. The model is applied in the study of biomechanical signals where it considers the slope as a specific measure extracted from the VGRF. We show that the calculated slope is random and different for every passive peak which visualizes the random character of VGRF signals. This randomness introduces a cyclostationarity of order 2. Hence, the obtained signal presents a random phenomenon through a slope that varies randomly, but is repeated periodically. The results show that the slope and polynomial random coefficients of the passive component of the VGRF can provide interesting information concerning biomechanics running and concerning fatigue associated with long-distance running.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis']"

In 2015, the authors proposed a change in the analysis, according to which, when the nonlinearity iterations do not converge, the analysis proceeds to the next integration step. In this paper, this change, and no other change, is applied to seismic analysis according to the seismic code of New Zealand, NZS 1170.5:2004. The purpose is to clarify whether the change can increase the analysis efficiency. The possibility of improving the efficiency is shown via analysis of a tall building’s structural model. The observations are explained, discussed, and generalized. As a main result, the change proposed in 2015 may considerably improve the efficiency when the tolerance is sufficiently small and is ineffective when the nonlinearity tolerance is sufficiently large.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis']"

Detection and processing of multiple signals are crucial for many synthetic biology applications. A variety of logic circuits operating in living cells have been implemented. One particular class of logic circuits uses site-specific recombinases mediating specific DNA inversion or excision. Recombinase logic offers many interesting features, including single-layer architectures, memory, low metabolic footprint, and portability in many species. Here, we present two automated design strategies for both Boolean and history-dependent recombinase-based logic circuits. One approach is based on the distribution of computation within multicellular consortia, and the other is a single-cell design. Both are complementary and adapted for non-expert users via a web design interface, called CALIN and RECOMBINATOR, for multicellular and single-cell design strategies, respectively. In this book chapter, we are guiding the reader step by step through recombinase logic circuit design, from selecting the design strategy fitting to their final system of interest to obtaining the final design using one of our design web interfaces.","['Life Sciences', 'Bioinformatics']"

Therefore, it isn’t easy to actively engage students and improve their performance in academics through conventional teaching methods. This paper reports on incorporating active learning activities into electronic courses that give academic improvement and active student engagement that instil creative and critical thinking. We explore the orchestration of dynamic teaching–learning practices in Analog Electronics (AE) and Electromagnetic Theory and Transmission Lines (EMTL) courses. This paper outlines the required methods of student-centric activities. It articulates how these methods are assigned to students and how they perform better in mid-term and end semester examinations. This paper emphasizes on ARCS model, use of ICT in STEM courses, efficient assessment tools, and constructive feedback to students.

The beam is assumed to be sufficiently long to consider 2D flow and has symmetric as well as asymmetric shape morphing curvature while oscillating in a fluid. The fluid-structure interaction problem is modelled by considering the unsteady Stokes equation. The resulting 1D boundary integral problem is solved by the boundary element method (BEM) numerically in MATLAB to obtain the desired pressure distribution on the beam. It is found that as the frequency oscillation of the rigid beam is increased, both the damping as well as added mass effects are decreased at different rates due to the gradual decrease in unsteady viscous layer. Finally, the hydrodynamic coupling effect on the beam is demonstrated at $$\beta =0.1$$ . However, for increase in the symmetric and asymmetric shape morphing parameters, the hydrodynamic decoupling appears lower than the gap ratio 5. The cantilever beam with optimal shape morphing parameter can be useful for the optimal designs of atomic force microscopy (AFM).","['Engineering', 'Nanotechnology and Microengineering', 'Mechatronics', 'Machinery and Machine Elements']"

This paper describes an agent-based model to determine the spatio-temporal distribution of Sahelian transhumant herds and their impact on vegetation. Three scenarios based on different values of rainfall and the proportion of vegetation that can be grazed by transhumant herds are simulated. The results of the simulations show that the impact of Sahelian transhumant herds on vegetation is not significant and that rainfall does not impact the alley phase of transhumance.

In data mining, data segregation is an important step in extracting useful information. Dividing strategies such as decision tree, neural network, SVM, Naive Bayes, and KNN which makes this task difficult due to a problem such as random selection of key parameters. Here we propose a crop prediction system using a decision tree and compare the results of the proposed system with the different class dividers. Decision tree has been shown to be a powerful modeling and predictive tool, which increases its effectiveness. Crop prediction methodology is used to predict the correct yield by sensing different soil parameters and atmospheric-related parameters. Parameters such as soil type, pH, and temperature. For that purpose, we used a cutting tree. Agricultural researchers around the world emphasize the need for an effective way to predict and improve crop growth. The complexity of yield prediction is very high due to various multi-sided metrics, and the lack of modeling, which leads to crop losses. It works in the form of a dynamic collection of a variety of crop data reviewed in history to predict crop yields and improve agricultural decision-making accurately. The proposed system will incorporate measurement data obtained from storage and IoT sensors, pH sensor, weather department, and application of the machine–machine learning algorithm, predicting the most appropriate yield according to current environmental conditions. This gives the farmer a variety of crops that can be grown.

We show that the basic building blocks of normal cones can be completely characterized in terms of subsets of the domain, independently of the particular realization of a p -box. Moreover, we then demonstrate how the building blocks can then be related to extreme points corresponding to a particular realization.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It can be costly and difficult to detect, traditionally requiring hours of assessment by a trained clinical. Recently, machine learning models have been trained to screen for depression with patient voice recordings collected during an interview with a virtual agent. To engage the patient in a conversation and increase the quantity of responses, the virtual interviewer asks a series of follow-up questions. However, asking fewer questions would reduce the time burden of screening for the participant. We, therefore, assess if these follow-up questions have a tangible impact on the performance of deep learning models for depression classification. Specifically, we study the effect of including the vocal and transcribed replies to one, two, three, four, five, or all follow-up questions in the depression screening models. We notably achieve this using unimodal and multimodal pre-trained transfer learning models. Our findings reveal that follow-up questions can help increase F1 scores for the majority of the interview questions.

Computing table similarity is a critical part of this process. Current Transformer-based language models have been successfully used to obtain word embedding representations of the tables to calculate their semantic similarity. Unfortunately, obtaining word embedding representations of large tables with thousands or millions of rows can be a computationally expensive process. The present work states the hypothesis that much of the content of a table can be deleted (i.e. rows can be dropped) without significantly affecting its word embedding representation, thus maintaining system performance at a much lower computational cost. To test this hypothesis a study was carried out using two different datasets and three state-of-the-art language models. The results obtained reveal that, in large tables, keeping just 10% of the content produces a word embedding representation that is 90% similar to the original one.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

A direct soil-structure interaction (SSI) analysis method can be implemented to simulate this phenomenon; however, this direct method is not easy for engineers to use. The goal of the present paper is to propose a simplified approach using the substructure method to model the nonlinearity of the liquefiable soil in a system of soil-structure interaction. The proposed approach and the related herein developed MATLAB code have been employed to evaluate the shear modulus of different types of soils regarding the seismic (earthquake-induced) excess pore water pressure ratio using the cumulative absolute velocity at each solution iteration. This procedure is implemented for the calculation of the dynamic stiffness (spring and dashpot coefficients) of the soil-structure system in order to be used in the substructure method presented in the NIST GCR 12-917-21. To assess the accuracy of the proposed approach, several multiple degree of freedom (MDOF) SSI systems have been studied using the Newmark-beta solution method. First, a comparison between the results of the proposed technique and a simulation using the finite difference method (FDM) shows that the present technique has a good accuracy.

Traditional preventative maintenance techniques are complemented by human visual inspection, in turn complemented by artificial intelligence vision techniques. The primary objective of this paper was to determine the most accurate deep learning model for use in corrosion detection; to achieve this, we devised an experimental comparison that tested five machine learning algorithms for the detection of corrosion from image data. The deep learning that forms the basis of algorithms used to solve object recognition problems traditionally requires large amounts of training data. As this data requires manual labelling by a person who is expert in the domain of corrosion, it is difficult and expensive to obtain; time and expense that increase considerably as more sophisticated pixel-level annotation is applied. We discovered that high levels of accuracy (98%) can be achieved using deep learning to detect corrosion using samples annotated with simple, image-level labels. We achieved this headline accuracy through the application of transfer learning using models that had been trained on the ImageNet dataset. With many deep learning algorithms to choose from, we systematically determined the most accurate model to use as a basis for further experimentation.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

These results show that random forests combined with FFT are a viable technique for attaining high recall when detecting grand mal epileptic seizures in short periods of time. CHB-MIT dataset was utilized for parity also showing good performance.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Machine Learning', 'Robotics and Automation']"

At the same time, the authors try to find a practical impulse or evidence for a general reflection on the treatment of emotions as transitional states, which at some point may lead to the emergence of new emotional qualities ascribed to phenomena (objects or events) perceived by the agent. Since there is a dispute in the literature about the meaning and usefulness of ‘private’ emotions, the article attempts to present in a transparent and technical manner the problem of hypothetical qualia against the background of selected theories of emotions, taking into account the cultural aspect or division. By treating qualia as an expression of individual emotional diversity and learning capacity, qualia can be assigned a quite technical role in modeling the human mind and in implementing autonomous robots and agents.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Computational Intelligence']"

Still, it is responsible for significant levels of morbidity in many regions of the world, with about 12 million cases annually, and about 600,000 fatalities. Diagnosis of typhoid poses a lot of challenges because its clinical presentation is confused with those of many other febrile infections such as malaria, yellow fever, etc. In addition, most developing countries do not have adequate bacteriology laboratories for further investigations. Decision support systems (DSSs) have been known to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the diagnosis process, in addition to improving access; however, most existing decision support models for the diagnosis of diseases have largely focused on ‘non-tropical’ conditions. An effective decision support model for the diagnosis of tropical diseases can only be developed through the engineering of experiential knowledge of physicians who are experts in the management of such conditions. In this study, we mined the experiential knowledge of twenty-five tropical disease specialist physicians to develop a decision support system based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The resulting model was tested based on 2044 patient data. Our model successfully determined the occurrence (or otherwise) of typhoid fever in 78.91% of the cases, demonstrating the utility of AHP in the diagnosis of typhoid fever.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

One of the challenges for quality control is to ensure the uniformity of density distribution. However, current areal density maps obtained from a beta transmission equipment are insufficient to identify variation and defects at the required level. As areal density maps can be interpreted as images, image super-resolution convolutional neural networks (CNNs) promise to reconstruct high-resolution areal density maps with fine texture details. However, for this promise to be realized two challenges need to be overcome. First, generating areal density maps is expensive, and only limited training data is available. Second, current 2D CNNs cannot provide sufficient accuracy in depth. Therefore, we propose a 3-layer voxel representation to adapt 2D CNNs to the particular application of Miralon sheets. Moreover, we also study the transform domains to provide more distinguishable features for density distribution patterns. Our results demonstrate that appropriate data augmentation is essential to achieving accurate results and transform domains could provide special information based on image contents. Using our proposed techniques, a high-resolution areal density map, which is rich in 3D information, can be obtained by leveraging 2D image super-resolution CNNs.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Mathematical Models of Cognitive Processes and Neural Networks']"

This has a profound impact on the working lives in almost all professions. Hence, people have been advised to work from home. However, working from home has several limitations and on average will cause financial losses to an individual. This has given rise to a dilemma where each person has the choice of working from home or going outside with the incentive of earning more capital but also increasing the risk of capturing the virus. We have modeled this situation using an n-player game where each player is trying to maximize their payoff, i.e., trying to make as much money as possible but limiting the risk of catching the virus. We aim to predict the proportion of a population cooperating, i.e., the following work from home guidelines at a particular stage of spread.

First, the swarm is divided into alliances based on the distance between UAVs, then members within each alliance compete for becoming the navigation UAV with others based on the information concentration. Only the navigation UAV communicates with the virtual leader UAV directly. On this basis, an extra repulsive force that is perpendicular to the virtual leader UAV's trajectory is imposed on navigation UAVs of the swarm. The weighting factor of the attractive force of virtual leader UAV to navigation UAV is introduced, which is an adaptive factor related to the distance between the virtual leader UAV and the navigation UAV in the alliance. These strategies not only ensure the swarm can effectively avoid large obstacles, but also solve the local minima problem in traditional artificial potential field methods.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Multiagent Systems', 'Systems Theory, Control']"

This chapter will focus on two elements aiming at understanding, predicting, measuring and quality-assuring constructs with examples from memory measurements: (i) explicit methods for testing theories of the measurement mechanism and establishment of metrological standards and (ii) substantive theories explaining the constructs themselves. Building on entropy as a principal explanatory variable, analogous to its use in thermodynamics and information theory, we demonstrate how more fit-for-purpose and valid memory measurements can be enabled. Firstly, memory task difficulty, extracted from a Rasch psychometric analysis of memory measurements of experimental data such as from the European NeuroMET project, can be explained with a construct specification equation (CSE). Based on that understanding, the CSE can facilitate the establishment of objective and scalable units through the generation of novel certified reference “materials” for metrological traceability and comparability. These formulations of CSEs can also guide how best to compose new memory metrics, through a judicious choice of items from various legacy tests guided by entropy-based equivalence, which opens up opportunities for formulating new, less onerous but more sensitive and representative tests. Finally, we propose and demonstrate how to formulate CSEs for person ability, correlated statistically and clinically with sets of biomarkers, that can be a means of providing diagnostic information to enhance clinical decisions and targeted interventions.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Health Informatics', 'Psychometrics', 'Health Administration']"

As public online presence grows and transactions take place around the world, it becomes important to identify and validate digital identities. In addition, larger organizations are collecting more and more personally identifiable information, leaving databases open to malicious intruders and untrusted individuals. The scenario of identity management is now changing with decentralized identity management solutions using blockchain technology which place the complete control of the user’s data with him/herself. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) management is a popular application for blockchain technology. During the six months that this investigation was conducted, several major attacks were carried out against companies that process large amounts of personal data. Equifax has lost over 140 million customer records, including blockchain identity management, digital identities, and self-governed identities. The SSI as a novelty in the identity management landscape is made possible with blockchain. It has been created for the ease of use, and anyone can understand and use the concept of self-sovereign identity. SSI can solve a variety of issues such as privacy, scalability, flexibility, proximity, and consent. This research paper attempts to answer the following research question. Is blockchain useful in IAM with SSI?

It is clear that membership degrees in fuzzy cluster analysis provide more information than crisp assignments of data objects to clusters. But fuzzy clustering has additional technical advantages compared to classical clustering approaches. Fuzzy clustering algorithms are less prone to converge to undesired results that correspond to local optima of the underlying objective function that is used for clustering. Furthermore, fuzzy clustering enables the definition of cluster validity measures that cannot be used in the context of crisp clustering. These purely technical advantages can be exploited to define fuzzy clustering algorithms that search for single clusters step-by-step. Finally, it is demonstrated how the approach of finding single clusters can be modified to estimate reference intervals or “normal ranges” in laboratory medicine.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Here, we have proposed a prognostic method to distinguish those influential users of online social media, based on network analysis. The susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model has been used for simulation of the propagation of information. For the particular seed nodes which have been chosen by practicing different centrality measures, detailed relative learning in terms of infected nodes is also exhibited. Selection of seed nodes through centrality measure is computationally exhaustive; therefore, we form a composite model, where the original social network is decomposed using the k-core, and centrality nodes are obtained from that decomposed network. Centrality measurements thus derived from the generated network are used as the seed of information propagation. Another important result derived from the empirical study is that not only the influential nodes, but neighbors of the influential nodes also have a greater impact on maximizing the effect of rumors.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics']"

In this method, two scalar quantities f and $$g_p$$ g p are defined and differentiated to arbitrary order using the Leibniz product rule to obtain higher order time derivatives of the variables which are implemented in the Taylor series expansion of the solution. Previously, this method has been proved to be highly precise and computationally efficient in propagating Two-body trajectories with full spherical harmonics gravity and atmospheric drag perturbation. More recently, this method has been implemented in propagating gravity and drag perturbed State Transition Matrix (STM) with machine precision level of accuracy. An expansion of the procedure to compute $$J_2$$ J 2 gravity perturbed Higher Order State Transition Tensors has also been presented in the subsequent work. In this paper, the method is further expanded to incorporate up to $$J_6$$ J 6 gravity and drag perturbation in the computation of Higher Order State Transition Tensors. Four types of orbits are considered for numerical simulations: LEO, MEO, GTO, and HEO. First, RMS error of the unperturbed STMs comparing to the closed form solution of Battin are presented. Then, the error in the symplectic nature of the gravity perturbed STM and Higher Order State Transition Tensors are checked, showing double precision accuracy of the STMs and tensors. Finally, initial error of the states of the $$J_2-J_6$$ J 2 - J 6 gravity and drag-perturbed orbits are propagated using the computed perturbed Higher Order State Transition Tensors and compared against the results obtained using the perturbed STM, showing at least 3 to 4 digits of accuracy improvement while using Higher Order Tensors.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Computational Science and Engineering', 'Theoretical, Mathematical and Computational Physics']"

Functional MRI (fMRI) need rapid acquisition to follow dynamic processes. Radial directions, due to their quality of overfitting the k-space center, are particularly suitable to average the effects of movements and are hence often used in fMRI. The acquisition of a complete dataset could be too slow to follow dynamic processes and undersampling is required to improve temporal resolution. Undersampling is accomplished randomly, basing on Compressed Sensing (CS) constraints to reduce aliasing and structured artifacts after reconstruction. However, reconstruction could be improved and/or data can be further reduced if a-priori information is collected regarding the underlying image under reconstruction and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based strategies are used to drive the process. As an example of the effective synergy between AI and data-driven acquisition/reconstruction in radial MRI, we present a GReedy Adaptive Data-driven Environment (GRADE) for intelligent radial sampling that uses the power spectrum of the reconstructed image and AI-based superresolution strategies in an iterative acquisition/reconstruction process. A detailed description of the method is furnished and experimental results are reported. Results demonstrate that GRADE reduces data redundancy and converges first to high quality images with respect to other undersampling radial modalities, such as regular sampling and golden angle (GA).","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Health Informatics']"

DC algorithm (DCA) is an efficient method able to find good-quality solutions to DC programs in a short amount of time. Optimization problems with semi-continuous variables and cardinality constraint have many applications in practice; however, their resolution is very challenging and time-consuming by available solvers. Motivated by different existing reformulations and approximations of the zero norm, this paper proposes four reformulations and approximations for the binary restriction to get four different DC models associated with the original model with semi-continuous variables and cardinality constraint. Then, it presents DCA-based heuristics to solve each DC program. The proposed heuristics are then integrated into a hybrid algorithm. Computational experiments over datasets of index-tracking problem compare the four DCA-based heuristics. Further, the performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm is evaluated in comparison with the relevant methods in the literature.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Lesion is a suspicious part which has an unusual growth compared to skin and also appears as a smooth surface with size variation, indiscriminate shape, and unusual colors. Segmentation plays an essential and crucial role here. When an image is divided into segments, important features can be projected and processed instead of complete image. Some expert dermatologists can see the segmented part of lesion and conclude the chances of occurring melanoma and non-melanoma. This phase plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and detection of cancer. However, selecting an apt segmentation technique for various data set images is a major challenge in the medical field. Hence, this work addresses a selection of suitable segmentation method which has to confer a good result. In this paper, three approaches of segmentation techniques binary Otsu, marker-based watershed, and K-means clustering are implemented and compared especially for irregular border lesion. Segmentation results are evaluated based on quality assessment metrics of image such as mean square error, mean absolute error, structural similarity index, and peak signal-to-noise ratio, i.e., MSE, MAE, SSIM, and PSNR. On an average, it is observed that for marker-based watershed segmentation MSE and MAE values are reduced to 35% and 10%. PSNR values are increased to 15%, and SSIM has shown an increase of 70% when compared to other two methods. This research shows that marker-based watershed segmentation works well for irregular border lesion images of melanoma.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Statistics, general', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

The method is based on the use of a finite number of lines crossing the collocation node under consideration and therefore it is also called the Finite Line Method (FLM). In the method, the Lagrange interpolation formulation is used to construct the shape functions over each line. By differentiating the shape functions, a set of equations are established along each line and the Least-Square technique is applied to all lines’ equations to form an equation set to solve the first and second orders of partial derivatives of any physical variables with respect to the global coordinates. The distinct feature of the proposed method is that the derived spatial partial derivatives are directly substituted into the governing partial differential equations and related boundary conditions to set up the system of equations with physical variables, temperatures, at all collocation nodes as unknowns. As an application, the proposed method is used to solve the heat conduction problems and two numerical examples are given to verify the correctness of the proposed method.","['Energy', 'Energy Systems', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Structural Materials', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer']"

The survival rate decreases if the cancer is not detected at an early stage. Breast ultrasound (BUS) is emerging as a popular modality for breast cancer detection owing to its several advantages over other modalities. We proposed a novel deep learning framework named BUS-Net for automated lesion segmentation in BUS images in this work. However, every deep learning framework has disadvantages of its own; however, the drawbacks associated with individual models can be overcome when combined. Our proposed BUS-Net is an ensemble of three popular deep learning frameworks, namely attention U-net, U-Net and SegNet. The final segmentation map generated by BUS-Net is a pixel-level fusion on the outputs of each of the individual frameworks. The potentiality of BUS-Net was tested on a publicly available dataset named BUSI dataset. This dataset consists of 647 tumor images collected from 600 different female patients. To prevent biased results, the training and test set were separate. BUS-Net framework achieved an accuracy—93.19%, precision—93.18%, recall—88.75%, dice—90.77%, and volume similarity—95.55% for lesion segmentation in the test set. The degree of correlation between the lesion region segmented by the medical experts and that segmented by BUS-Net was high ( $$R^2 = 0.9131$$ R 2 = 0.9131 ). Further, the performance of BUS-Net was also compared with the state-of-the-art techniques. This comparison showed that BUS-Net maintains a tradeoff between precision and recall, proving the robustness, efficiency, and reliability of the framework.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics']"

Therefore, thermal management of Li-ion battery system is essential to eliminate heat generated inside the battery that leads to performance enrichment and eliminate thermal runaway. There have been different technologies implemented for battery thermal management which includes active cooling (forced air cooling, water cooling and thermoelectric cooler), passive cooling (phase change material (PCM) cooling, natural air cooling and heat pipe) and coupled cooling (Air + PCM cooling, water + PCM cooling, etc.) system. Among all the system, PCM integrated battery has gained huge attention just because of low cost, calm to operate and easy availability of PCM. In the present review article, a thermal management of Li-ion battery system incorporated with PCM has been studied according to different analysis methods. Paraffin, an organic kind of PCM is utilized in all the paper reviewed due to high heat storage capacity but less thermal conductivity and leakage during phase transformation creates problem. So, composite kind of PCM has been developed after mixing properties enhancing material in a suitable proportion with paraffin. Properties enhancing material must have good thermal conductivity and encapsulated in nature that can improve thermal conductivity and hold liquid PCM to eliminate leakage. Experimental, numerical and analytical investigations have been carried out to design battery with passive cooling system. From all these investigations, it was trying to find out the thermo-mechanical behavior of composite PCM and their performance during thermal management.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics']"

The conducted analyses confirmed the existence of differences both in the level of use of energy from renewable sources and the structure of its production. The changes in energy balances necessitated by Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and the Council and the goals stipulated in the Paris Agreement also unfolded differently in the countries studied. They resulted in the majority of members achieving the prescribed limits. The highest share of energy from renewable sources was recorded among northern European and Baltic countries. In contrast, it developed the fastest in Central and Eastern Europe. The lowest level of use of green energy was detected among the Balkan countries and in France.","['Energy', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Research Skills', 'Political Science and International Relations, general', 'Sustainable Development']"

Potential of AM in the Helicopter Domain,OriginalPaper,"A helicopter is a complex engineering machine which involves several subsystems (structure, propulsion unit, control system, among others). Their diversity and their operating parameters are an obstacle to improving and optimizing the overall aircraft design. Recent studies are focused on improving aerodynamics, propeller design, rotor performance, or structure. Focusing on the last one, the limitations that exist with current manufacturing processes highlight the difficulty of lightening it. Thus, additive manufacturing appears (AM) as a new candidate to be explored. In fact, by studying one of AM potentials, this article highlights a 25,7% in structure weight loss. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to present how AM could be applied to increase helicopter structure performance. Firstly, a summary of the current helicopter architectures in the market will be carried out, the goal is to identify and classify the principal and necessary components shared between them. Then, the selected AM potentials that could be applied to the airframe are presented. Next, the implementation of part consolidation in the structural design for lightweighting. Finally, based on the above collected information, a simplified modelling approach for AM will be proposed to implement in a first optimization study.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Computer-Aided Engineering (CAD, CAE) and Design']"

Geotextile was utilized to strengthen the soil. The model footing was constructed from a steel plate measuring 100 mm by 100 mm. The top layer spacing and the number of reinforcing layers were examined in this research. Additionally, the scale effect of model testing was numerically investigated by conducting a three-dimensional finite element analysis using (ABAQUS) on various sizes of square footing. Also, the impact of geotextile thickness and the behavior of sand on top of silty sand with three woven geotextiles on ultimate bearing capacity (BC) was studied. The experimental findings indicate that the system with three geotextile layers, and a top layer spacing of 0.25 B, where B is (the plate’s width), achieves the maximum bearing capacity. The numerical analyses indicated that the BCR decreases as the footing size increases (B). Also, it should be noted that as the thickness of the geotextile increases, the bearing capacity (BC) of the soil increases. A good agreement between the experimental and numerical results was observed when the numerical analysis findings were compared to those obtained from experimental investigations.","['Engineering', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Environment, general', 'Building Construction and Design']"

Industrialization, urbanization, and the increasing population of cities have the main role in this problem. Transportation agencies in almost all the countries are trying their best to alleviate the traffic congestion problem. This study develops a traffic congestion evaluation method, which is categorized into four states named low, medium, congestion, and serious congestion. Convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) neural network (NN) was trained to learn multivariate features as the inputs like categorized vehicular speed, time, and day of the week with respect to the traffic speed as an output of the whole stream. Trained model was used for short-term traffic speed prediction. Also, the prediction accuracy and stability of the Conv-LSTM NN has been compared with other neural network models, e.g., multi-layer perceptron (MLP), cascade forward back-propagation (CFBP), recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) NN, and convolutional neural network(CNN). Results confirm that the Conv-LSTM NN achieves higher prediction performance than the compared models. Python 3.8.3 was used for programming purpose. Model code automatically selects 80% and 20% time intervals of the datasets in a random way for training and testing, respectively, from the traffic data. Furthermore, Conv-LSTM NN was combined with the developed congestion evaluation method and then the traffic congestion state was predicted. Study results confirm that the Conv-LSTM NN can be successfully applied for the prediction of traffic speed and traffic congestion status with non-homogeneous traffic in the Indian context.","['Engineering', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Sustainable Development']"

All these researchers have taken a small sample size and provided a conclusion. Hence, further study is required with a larger number of samples for a better conclusion. Working with ink palm print and geometrical instruments on large sample size is a tedious task and hence computer-based method is required to identify triradii and to find the “atd” angle.

However, given the size of most LV systems, free-free testing is a challenge and often not feasible. With this, a test stand, typically the launch pad itself, is introduced as the means of support. This shifts the challenge to developing robust numerical methods for removing the influence of the launch pad from the integrated system modal test. The Space Launch System (SLS) is no exception where the mobile launcher (ML) is used to support the vehicle for the integrated modal test (IMT). For the IMT, it is well understood from pretest analysis with finite element models (FEMs) of the SLS and SLS coupled to ML that the ML has a significant influence on the SLS modal properties especially in the lower-frequency range where the primary SLS bending modes exist. An accelerance decoupling (AD) method has been formulated for the purpose of “subtracting out” the influence of the ML from the IMT results. With AD, the SLS decoupled frequency response functions (FRFs) are directly extracted from the IMT FRFs. The subject approach is aimed to utilize measured data only and achieve a robust FRF decoupling Scheme. AD is derived from a widely used coupling technique called “receptance coupling” (RC). The AD core equation reverses the RC process and utilizes a pair of auxiliary equations that enable the core equation to be resolved based on measured data only. In AD, the decoupled component FRFs are extracted from the coupled system FRFs with a transformation to remove the contribution of the “subtractive component.” This paper addresses the AD’s operational flexibility to resolve SLS free-free modal properties from coupled system measured data but also the possibility to include data from FEM if there is enough confidence in the FEM or if it is asserted that the effect to the final outcome is reasonable.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Fourier Analysis', 'Abstract Harmonic Analysis']"

Different social network measures labelled as “centralities” have previously been used in the network analysis community to find influential nodes in a network. It is debatable how valid these centrality measures for the political connection are. This paper aims not only to identify the political connection through social network analysis but to analyze the different levels of political connection through different centrality measures according to the country's institutional environment. For this purpose, we used data from a relationship-based economy like Pakistan from 2009 to 2015. We analyze the five different levels of political connection and examine their role through five social network measures: degree, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector, and eccentricity. Our finding demonstrates that degree, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector are not suitable measures for political connection role and control in the directors’ network. Closeness centrality gives a better understanding of how other directors are closed to politically connected directors and which level of political connection attracts the other directors but couldn’t explain how far a political director can access. We found eccentricity as the most suitable measure for the political connection and their different role. We also found the federal and provincial level political connections become more central and important through the eccentricity measure after the regime's shift from autocratic to democratic.","['Business and Management', 'IT in Business', 'Business Information Systems', 'Organization', 'Business and Management, general', 'Organizational Studies, Economic Sociology']"

During shale oil production, the fluids with high temperature are transmitted to the wellhead, and the wellbore temperature will rise extremely, which greatly affects the cement sheath integrity. In this paper, the linear expansion coefficient of cement stone under the temperature of 500 ℃ were measured. Based on the experimental data and the field data of shale oil well, the stage finite element modeling method was adopted to establish a casing-cement-formation (CCF) model considering the temperature and pressure coupling. The results revealed that the linear expansion coefficient of cement stone decreases linearly with the increase of temperature. When the temperature was less than 250 ℃, the cement stone expanded. However, when the temperature exceeded 250 ℃, it shrank. The maximum shrinkage ratio can be 25 × 10 –6 /℃ for the temperature of 500 ℃. The circumferential stress of the inner wall of cement sheath first increased rapidly, then slowly decreased to be stable. The larger the cement stone shrink ratio was, the greater the circumferential stress was. The maximum circumferential stress can exceed 10 MPa for the shrink ratio of 25 × 10 –6 /℃. It can be concluded that the circumferential stress appears in a tensile state under high temperature conditions, which can easily lead to the failure of the cement sheath seal. The strength of the cement stone should be considered when designing the cement slurry property. In addition to the decay performance, the expansion of the cement stone should also be designed to ensure that the cement stone does not shrink when subjected to high temperature conditions.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Computational Science and Engineering', 'Theoretical, Mathematical and Computational Physics']"

When energy dissipation structure is tested by RTHT, the damper is usually adopted as physical substructure and the structure is adopted as numerical substructure. In order to minimize the seismic response of energy dissipation structure, many dampers installed at different positions are often necessary. The dynamic response of dampers at different positions is different in seismic action. Therefore, more than one damper needs to be tested physically in RTHT, and multiple dampers loaded by multiple actuators in real time will increase control difficulty. To solve this issue, an offline hybrid testing method for energy dissipation structure is proposed based on machine learning, which avoids the challenge of control and stability caused by real-time loading of multiple actuators in RTHT.

The two equations are solved with trainloads as elementary moving load excitation, avoiding too complex models. This non-classically damped problem has been solved with a Runge-Kutta finite-difference method with temporal-spatial discretization. Furthermore, the authors experimentally validated the mathematical TTBI solution, comparing it with the displacement response of a case study. Specifically, at first, experimental modal bending stiffness parameters have been estimated to provide a representative equivalent EB beam model. Thereafter, the coupling effects of the ballast have been considered with a sensitivity analysis of the modelling parameters. Finally, the optimization to the actual experimental response of the model provided an estimate of the vertical ballast stiffness and its damping. The relevant difference in the damping of the experimental and mathematical model evidences the fundamental role of the ballast in adsorbing vibrations induced by the train passages.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The Damageability of these elements largely determines the possibility of further use of products containing them. Therefore, the adequate calculation of thin-walled element mechanical behavior is one of the urgent problems in the mechanics of deformable solids. The mathematical model is developed to describe the deformed state of the thin-walled rod with a non-uniform cross-section under arbitrary loading. The resolving equation is obtained to determine the angle of twist of the compound contour under the action of longitudinal forces. To confirm the validity of the developed model, a number of typical metal-metal and metal composite bars have been manufactured, for which experimental measurements of angular displacements in space relative to the selected frame of reference were taken. Results of calculation of the angles of rod twist show fairly good agreement with experimental values for angle bars with the composite reinforcing plate (the difference is 15…25%).

The diagnosis process is simplified by using machine learning algorithms. The learning capabilities and classification performance of such machine learning models are mostly influenced by the quantity and quality of the input features. Thus, the appropriate selection of a subset of the most prominent features for machine learning becomes essential to eliminate redundancy of high dimension or irrelevant measurements of the features. In this paper, a filter-based feature selection technique is introduced to select the optimal feature space. A Gaussian ant lion optimization (GALO) is put in with a filter-based selection technique to select the feature subset from a high dimension feature dataset obtained from the vibration signals of centrifugal pump under different health conditions (normal, clogging, wheel cut and blade cut). The K-nearest neighbour (KNN) classifier is applied to the selected feature subset to find the classification accuracy. In addition, the proposed method has been compared with other art of work. The results reveal that the proposed GALO-KNN with filter-based feature selection technique outperforms both in feature reduction and classification accuracy and secures the best feature subset with less computational effort. Thus, the proposed method is capable enough to perform the selection task and shows excellent potential in fault diagnosis.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics']"

Although several approaches to the problem have been introduced, they assume an environment without obstacles. In this paper, we introduce a method for the TSPN with polygonal neighborhoods taking polygonal obstacles into account. The method splits the problem into two subproblems: the Generalized Travelling Salesman Problem and the Touring Polygons Problem, which are solved sequentially. While the mature metaheuristic called Generalize Large Neighborhoods Search is employed to solve the first subproblem, the second one is solved by modifying the rubber-band algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms a state-of-the-art algorithm modified for the environment with obstacles by 10–20% in most cases.","['Engineering', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Robotics', 'Computational Intelligence']"

Similarly, micro electro-mechanical system (MEMS) sensors are spreading for monitoring applications, given their appealing costs. Considering the importance of data for a SHM-targeted decision-making process, a conscious use of these technologies requires a deeper analysis from a metrological point of view, to ensure reliability and robustness of the provided data. Consequently, in a multi-node sensing architecture, concepts like sensitivity of each node or data synchronization becomes of uttermost importance, especially if modal parameters extraction is sought. This paper is intended as a warning for designers of SHM monitoring architectures: can we simply replace standard sensing devices with low-cost systems and expect they perform as well as their “stronger brothers”? The answer to this question is tentatively provided by discussing results obtained in a testing campaign performed on some reinforced concrete beams, dynamically tested through two different monitoring systems: a standard, high-performance system exploiting high-sensitivity piezoelectric accelerometers and a low-cost MEMS digital accelerometers-based one, not coupled to a high performance data acqusition system, rather.

Four different lap joint samples are considered, each of them constituted by two aluminum plates connected with a different technology: one epoxy adhesive, one toughened acrylic adhesive, one acrylic foam tape, and one bolted joint, which is assessed for multiple preload configurations. For each of these cases, an experimental modal analysis is performed, a finite element model with input parameters from the datasheet of the bonding method is set up, and finally these joint parameters are updated with respect to the experimental reference.

In this research, unlike most current existing systems, we propose a classical to quantum mapping channel for zero-knowledge that will not be negatively affected by the existence of quantum technologies.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Medical items ranging from intravenous fluid containers to medical syringes are created to satisfy their demands using a range of thermoplastics and Plastic Injection Moulding (PIM). However, even advanced profile mouldings can suffer from dimensional inaccuracies. The current study advances our understanding of thermoplastics, specifically Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE) material moulding for medical syringe plungers using injection moulding equipment. Eight injection moulding input factors were investigated in order to decrease the depth sink marks and weight created during the injection moulding of thermoplastic LDPE material. The 27 trials were piloted in accord with Taguchi's Design of Experiment, and the variables were optimised using the newly developed Honey Badger and Capuchin Search Algorithms, as well as analysis of variance, for determining the most dominating parameter. The cooling time and melt temperature of the plastic injection moulded part are the most significant factors influencing the sink-mark depth and weight of the part, respectively, according to the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test.","['Engineering', 'Materials Engineering', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Structural Materials', 'Biomaterials']"

Efficient and reliable obstacle avoidance algorithms ensure the effective execution of cluster tasks. Based on the speed cone obstacle judgment, this paper presents a two-dimensional obstacle avoidance control method for the cluster formation situation, and integrates the artificial potential field factors to improve the collision avoidance effect in the formation. For dynamic scenarios, the algorithm decides an avoidance mode according to the collision judgment. In the avoidance mode, a tangent circular trajectory is planned according to the position of the assumed safety zone, and a smooth trajectory is generated in real-time. For static scenarios, the algorithm discretizes the obstacle surface, searching for the edge of the obstacle and the range of passable angles. According to the boundary phase, the tangent trajectory is efficiently generated. The study conducts simulation analysis on the static and dynamic scenarios, and obtains that the algorithm has a good effect on the realization of two-dimensional obstacle avoidance scenes, which can make the formation smoothly pass through the random obstacle area without falling into the blind corner of obstacles.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Multiagent Systems', 'Systems Theory, Control']"

Several analytical approaches have recently been employed to develop a correlation among welding parameters and weldment quality. Computational intelligence techniques are those that can simulate the relationship among weld process factors and weldment efficiency in a shorter period. The estimation of mechanical properties in this study was carried out utilizing an artificial neural network (ANN). An artificial neural network model developed to understand the relationship between tensile strength (UTS) of vibratory-assisted aluminium weldments to vibromotor voltage input and vibration time during welding. With the available experimental results, a model was created among vibratory aided gas tungsten arc welding (TIG) parameters and tensile strength (UTS) of 5052 H32 aluminium alloy weldments. The created ANN model is tested using results of the experiment. This trained ANN model can also predict the aluminium alloy weld joint ultimate tensile strength with an accuracy of 97.77%.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Materials Engineering']"

However, there are cases in which Human experts are needed to label the data, which may have a significant cost in terms of human resources and time. In these cases, it is often best to learn on-the-fly, without expecting for the whole data to be labeled. Often, it is desirable to guide the Human annotators into focusing on the more relevant instances: this constitutes the so-called active learning. In this paper we propose an approach in which a clustering algorithm is used to find groups of similar instances. Then, the procedure is guided with the objective of favoring the annotation of the groups that are under-represented in the labeled dataset. Results show that this approach leads to models that are, over time, more accurate and reliable.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This article aimed to develop a bibliometric analysis on Lean-Agile Education, mapping the global scientific production on this topic and focusing on the process of education management in the digital age. Therefore, an exploratory and descriptive study was developed with a quantitative approach based on the collection and treatment of secondary data. Between 2000 and 2021, only 34 articles were identified on the Web of Science database, organized into three categories according to management, pedagogical, and curricular content perspectives, mostly found in English and published in the US and Europe, with three publications from the Aalto University (Finland) affiliation. It was observed that this discipline does not follow the main bibliometric laws (Lotka’s Law, Zipt’s Law, and Bradford Law) with only 6 authors with more than one publication, high dispersion of journals responsible for publications, and frequency of words without constant proportion within the field of study, with emphasis on “software”, “lean”, “agile”, and “education”. Therefore, this bibliometric analysis pointed out trends for the area, indicating that Lean-Agile Education is a contemporary topic and still scarce in number and diversity of publications with an opportunity to go beyond new studies.","['Social Sciences', 'Science and Technology Studies']"

According to the maneuver characteristics of the fixed-wing UAV and the formation flight requirements, the FTP problem’s mathematical models are established, including the kinematic model, trajectory constraint, collision avoidance constraint, and formation constraint. Then, the formation flight process is modeled as the concatenation of multiple formation transformations and formation maintenances, and the FTP problem is formulated as a multi-phase optimal control problem. On these bases, a method for solving the FTP problem is proposed based on the Gauss Pseudospectral Method. The results of simulation and field experiments show that the proposed method can plan the formation trajectories of all UAVs that meet the relevant constraints and achieve the formation transformation and formation maintenance of UAV swarms.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Multiagent Systems', 'Systems Theory, Control']"

The present paper deals with a transient (steady and unsteady) combination between free convection and volumetric radiation in a closed enclosure in thermal incompressible fluid flows in a bi-dimensional, differentially heated enclosure with emitting, scattering and absorbing volume. In the equation of energy, the radiative heat flux was simulated using the CVFEM, (Control- Volume-Finite-Element-Method) in the RTE (Radiative Transfer Equation). The Navier–Stokes equations which describe natural convection were solved with a D2Q9 temperature and velocity flow distributions using Lattice Boltzmann BGK Method. Separate particle distribution functions in the LBM were used to calculate the density, velocity and thermal fields. The obtained findings in the current work were compared with literature and good validation are demonstrated. The streamlines, the horizontal and vertical velocities, midline temperature, and the isotherms were highlighted and discussed under various parameters such as Rayleigh number, convection radiation number, in both steady and also unsteady cases. The LBM-CVFEM was ascertained to be a reliable numerical technique for future engineering applications dealing with transient coupling heat transfer problems.","['Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Energy Storage']"

The prime mover for the generating block is the GE 9HA.02 gas turbine, and the power plant is the latest combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) commissioned in January 2021 and the world’s first commercial operation of the GE 9HA.02 fleet globally. Fuel consumption of the gas turbine is the primary concern as it which significantly affected by the gas turbine performance, which later translates to the power plant revenue to operate at optimum cost. Note that the fuel consumption of the CCGT is closely related to the Air Filter House (AFH) condition located at the most upstream component to protect the gas turbine from erosion, corrosion and fouling; as well as to achieve the required performance, efficiency, and life expectations. The present work aims to evaluate the value of pressure drop in the AFH and the fuel consumption. These two related parameters are significant for mitigation measures to achieve a cost-effective power plant operation. The operation data for both parameters based on the actual CCGT plant operation has been analysed from March to June 2021. Consecutively over the four months of operation, the AFH pressure drop had increased from 666.80 to 741.12 Pa (Pascal), translating to a total increment of 74.32 Pa or an average of 18.58 Pa every month. Separately, fuel consumption increased from 120,460.61 to 123,614.13 m 3 /h, a total increment of 3153.52 m 3 /h or an average of 788.38 m 3 /h for every month, which later translated to an average increment of fuel cost amounting to RM 767.86/h. The present results reveal that the AFH pressure drop has directly impacted the fuel consumption over the analysis period. On average, an increment of 1 Pa of the AFH pressure drop will increase fuel cost amounting to RM 41.33/h. It is expected that current air filtration elements can last within 41 months to achieve their allowable pressure limit but are subjected to environmental and operating philosophy changes. The analysis results could be the basis for early filter replacement, proper selection of filter elements and frequent conduct of online and offline compressor washing as recommended by the manufacturer.","['Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Energy Storage']"

Many carsharing operators, e.g., GoFun, offer incentives to flexible users for accepting alternative itineraries and also adopt parking reservation policies. In this paper, we propose a network flow model, where a user’s itinerary corresponds to a path in the network, and then develop a new path search heuristic algorithm that iteratively improves a given solution by solving shortest path problems. We use real data from GoFun as an example to conduct extensive computational experiments.

Hilbert marginal spectrum (HMS) is used to understand EEG signals as they are highly nonlinear and nonstationary signals, and hence, traditional Fourier analysis (TFA) method fails to represent amplitude of each frequency. The Hilbert spectrum works as a two-step process in which signal is separated into intrinsic mode functions, and then, Hilbert transform is applied to the result to obtain frequency spectrum (FS). The proposed methodologies useably developed an automatic seizure detection model in which frequency represented by HMS is fed into support vector machine (SVM), and hence, seizures are detected by comparing EEG signals with Fourier frequency analysis. In this paper, it is even proved that the developed method is more effective than the existent method by comparing the results obtained from both the methods on same database.

A type of code smell, which is common in software projects, is “duplicated code” bad smell, also known as code clones. These types of smells generally arise in a software system due to the copy-paste-modify actions of software developers. They can either be exact copies or copies with certain modifications. Different clone detection techniques exist, which can be broadly classified as text-based, token-based, abstract syntax tree-based (AST-based), metrics-based, or program dependence graph-based (PDG-based) approaches based on the amount of preprocessing required on the input source code. Researchers have also built clone detection techniques using a hybrid of two or more approaches described above. In this paper, we did a narrative review of the metrics-based techniques (solo or hybrid) reported in the previously published studies and analyzed them for their quality in terms of run-time efficiency, accuracy values, and the types of clones they detect. This study can be helpful for practitioners to select an appropriate set of metrics, measuring all the code characteristics required for clone detection in a particular scenario.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Professional Computing']"

In the present experimental study, the vibrations generated by the shaft rotor bearing system in presence of shaft crack(s) and bearing races fault(s) have been analyzed. Vibration signals of healthy and defective shaft bearing system have been captured using of National Instrumentation (NI) data acquisition module and LabVIEW software. The captured vibration signals were analyzed in time domain and frequency domain for the defect detection using MATLAB software.

The presence of peaks at critical frequency ( F cr ) and its harmonics, while shaft rotates in subcritical speed (1/3, 1/2) range, admit the presence of shaft crack. Moreover, the change in regular shape of orbit plots at the subcritical speed also identifies the cracked shafts.

It has been established that the «longevity» of the boundary dynamic and thermal layers of the surrounding air-heated surfaces of metallic friction elements at the open brake friction pairs are different. What unites them is that the boundary heat layer «sticks» to the metal surface, and the dynamic boundary layer «sticks» to the bottom of the main flow of the surrounding air. The frequency of application of the brake is the main factor in the break-up of the boundary heat layer of the air, which is a kind of insulator for convective heat exchange. The rotation speed of metallic friction elements during injections and open brake friction pairs determines the laminar or turbulent mode of washing with air streams of their surfaces. The dependencies of the total coefficient of resistance (C) on the Reynolds number (Re) during the longitudinal washing by the flow of air with a variable angle of attack (45–125°), the outer surfaces of the rim of the pulley, and the brake drum are determined, By separating zones of constant and significantly decreasing values of coefficient C. The method of calculating heat transfer coefficients which are «closing» in estimating heat transfer coefficients, has been developed.","['Engineering', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Engineering Design', 'Materials Engineering']"

A three-dimensional microchannel of 750 µm width, 500 µm depth and 50mmlength was constructed and a fluid flow inside this channel was simulated considering a flow rate of 420 µl/min. The model uses the Navier–Stokes equations with no-slip conditions. As a first step of the simulation process, a particle tracing model was implemented in a laminar flow domain with isothermal conditions. Later a temperature gradient was imposed normal to the flow direction and the field was solved under non-isothermal conditions. Results reveal that the particles motion is significantly influenced by the presence of thermal field. Variation of temperature gradient and its effect on thermophoresis phenomenon was presented in detail.","['Energy', 'Energy Systems', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Materials Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

The paper reviews the structures and comparative efficiencies of dynamic and impact oscillation dampers. Recommendations for optimization of some oscillation dampers tunning parameters for process operations with relative rotation of the tool and workpiece are provided based on the research conducted. The optimization criterion is assumed to be a reduction to the minimum of the peak amplitudes of the main system oscillations with mass in the entire frequency band characteristic of fine boring. The efficiency of oscillations damping is greatly influenced by changes in the parameters of the machining system with a dynamic oscillations dampener with viscous friction. In particular, the suppression of object oscillations using a vibration damper with a variable stiffness of its main mass fastening is studied. The results of studies of seven types of oscillation dampers for cantilever boring bars are presented. Comparison of the efficiency factors of boring bars oscillation dampers is assessed by the amplitude-frequency characteristics and the ultimate stiffness values of boring bars during boring.","['Engineering', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Engineering Design', 'Materials Engineering']"

Accurate interpretation of these scans to detect small lytic bone lesions is time intensive. A functional deep learning) algorithm to detect lytic lesions on CTs could improve the value of these CTs for myeloma imaging. Our objectives were to develop a DL algorithm and determine its performance at detecting lytic lesions of multiple myeloma. Methods Axial slices (2-mm section thickness) from whole-body low-dose CT scans of subjects with biochemically confirmed plasma cell dyscrasias were included in the study. Data were split into train and test sets at the patient level targeting a 90%/10% split. Two musculoskeletal radiologists annotated lytic lesions on the images with bounding boxes. Subsequently, we developed a two-step deep learning model comprising bone segmentation followed by lesion detection. Unet and “You Look Only Once” (YOLO) models were used as bone segmentation and lesion detection algorithms, respectively. Diagnostic performance was determined using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results Forty whole-body low-dose CTs from 40 subjects yielded 2193 image slices. A total of 5640 lytic lesions were annotated. The two-step model achieved a sensitivity of 91.6% and a specificity of 84.6%. Lesion detection AUROC was 90.4%. Conclusion We developed a deep learning model that detects lytic bone lesions of multiple myeloma on whole-body low-dose CTs with high performance.

A cryogenic common bulkhead (CBH) tank is one of the best packaging solutions that utilize a single tank with a common bulkhead separating two independently pressurized compartments containing liquid hydrogen (LH2) at 20 K and liquid oxygen (LOX) at 77 K. A CBH tank can serve as a good replacement to the current cryogenic stage of Indian Space Research Organization’s (ISRO) launch vehicle consisting of a truss-type intertank structure. A CBH tank eliminates all the major issues currently associated and encountered with a truss-type intertank structure. A sandwich-type CBH with a thermal insulation capacity and required mechanical performance is considered. A CBH core made of the foam-filled honeycomb (FFH) was found suitable in terms of the mass and space requirement compared to the previously existing concepts of a pure foam or a pure honeycomb core. An FFH core offered a maximum mass saving of 475 kg with respect to the current GSLV MkIII configuration. Manufacturing feasibility and NDI techniques are studied for the development of a CBH dome in a CBH tank. A decoupled test setup for testing the thermal and mechanical performance of the CBH material is planned, keeping in mind the complexities of handling cryogenics. The initial test results from our recent development for the thermal setup are presented and were found satisfactory for further testing with variable conditions and environments.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Machinery and Machine Elements']"

Three pump models were considered, with M2, M3 and M4 respectively representing their discharge sections. They were operated at high rotational speed and flowrate. Their stress distributions and their pressure limits were investigated both by experimentation and by using the finite elements software ABAQUS. The TRESCA criterion, the equivalent plastic strain (PEEQ), and the strain energy density (SENER) are the three fracture mechanical criteria which were further applied for the analysis of the discharge sections pressure limit. Furthermore, PEEQ was found as the most relevant criterion because it underestimates the values of the ultimate pressure. It was used in combination with the linear regression method for the formulation of a more suitable model. A global regression equation was then presented. Based on this equation, it is possible to predict ultimate pressure for any discharge section geometry.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Materials Engineering', 'Classical and Continuum Physics']"

The Von mises stress theory was used to determine the stress, resultant load and displacement. The results obtained from the FEA simulation were compared with the mechanical properties of the hydraulic press brake. The maximum stress induced is significantly lower than the tensile strength of the hydraulic press brake. Hence, the stress induced due to bending cannot cause the cast alloy to yield. Also, the buckling force significantly exceeds the resultant force giving no chances for buckling. The designed hydraulic press brake is flexible enough to control using hydraulic cylinders and enhances sufficient strength and rigidity during clamping and loading conditions.","['Engineering', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering', 'Computer-Aided Engineering (CAD, CAE) and Design']"

The interventions that constitute vision rehabilitation are tailored to each patient’s functional goals and personal preferences. This chapter describes the theory, structure, and mechanics of an adaptive patient-reported outcome measure – the Activity Inventory (AI). The AI was developed to identify each patient’s unique set of functional goals within a hierarchical framework, to specify the cognitive and motor activities ( i.e. , tasks in different functional domains) the patient customarily performs to achieve his or her personal goals, and to elicit ordinal patient ratings of the importance and difficulty of each goal and the difficulty of relevant subsidiary tasks under goals that meet or exceed defined importance and difficulty criteria. The theoretical assumptions of a Rasch psychometric model that is employed to estimate measures of the patient’s overall visual ability from goal difficulty ratings and ability in each functional domain from task difficulty ratings before and after vision rehabilitation are presented and the results for a large group of low vision patients are reviewed. This chapter then explores the issue of how individual patient preferences must be factored into the outcome measures to determine the utility of functional improvements from vision rehabilitation. A theoretical framework for incorporating the utility of individual vision rehabilitation outcomes is offered and its application to functional outcome data is demonstrated.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Health Informatics', 'Psychometrics', 'Health Administration']"
doi:10.1007/978-981-19-2635-8_7,en,Efficient Gain Parameter Selection Approach for Sliding Mode Control with Application to Rotorcraft Trajectory Tracking Control Design,OriginalPaper,"In most extant flight trajectory tracking control schemes, such as sliding mode control, gain parameter selection is time-consuming owing to the lack of explicit methods or rationales for the selection. Therefore, we herein propose a simple and efficient parameter selection method for sliding mode control. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we designed several types of trajectory tracking control laws for a rotorcraft. We derived the relation between gain parameters and desired damping ratio/desired natural frequency by utilizing modal analysis to transform trajectory tracking error as a second order system with respect to position and heading angle. Thus, we rationally determined gain parameters based on the expected system response, which corresponded to the classical response expected in a second order system. After implementing our method to the trajectory tracking control law for a Bo-105 rotorcraft in simulations, we determined that tracking performances can be upgraded or degraded based on damping ratio and natural frequency. In our controller design, as the desired damping ratio increased, although no significant differences exist at high damping ratio, undesired oscillatory responses disappeared. Further, the effects of variation in desired natural frequencies are not as significantly evident as those due to variation in damping ratio. However, the effects of desired natural frequency can be observed in the heading angle of the current trajectory tracking control design; as the natural frequency increased, the tracking accuracy increased. Therefore, the proposed method can serve as a guideline for tuning many parameters involved in the design of an advanced control law.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

Most of the empirical formulas used to predict the elastic modulus are limited to natural aggregate concretes (NAC). The formulae developed for recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) are constrained by experimental conditions since there is a considerable variation in recycled aggregate properties from place to place. In the present study, swarm based soft computing technique is used to overcome this issue. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained by both standalone Levenberg-Marquardt back-propagation (LM-BP) technique and a hybrid of LM-BP and elephant herding optimization (EHO). The developed model is trained by 400 datasets obtained from literature which include seven inputs (i.e., water to cement (w/c) ratio, replacement of NA by RA in volume (r), coarse aggregates to cement (CA/C) ratio, fine aggregate to total aggregate (FA/TA) ratio, saturated surface dry specific gravity (SGSSD) of mixed CA(NA + RA), water absorption ( $$W_a$$ ) of mixed CA and cube compressive strength ( $$F_c$$ )) and one output as elastic modulus of RAC. The performances of the developed models are evaluated using standard statistical measures like MSE, r and MAE. The developed hybrid model yields ’r’ of 0.9966 and 0.9935, MSE of 0.4765 and 0.4807, and MAE of 1.1080 and 1.1888 for training and testing respectively which outperformed standalone technique of LM-BP in every aspect for predicting the elastic modulus of RAC.

However, the distance travelled by swirling flow varies according to the swirler’s design configuration. As a result, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the heat transfer performance and friction factor of a new turbine-like decaying flow swirler (TDS). The distance traversed and decays downstream the tube by the created swirling flow will then be determined. The TDS is a rigid turbine or compressor consist of four twisted blades at 172.2° set at the entrance of a fully developed 1.5 m tube with a dimensionless length (L/D) of 93.75. A 60:40% water and ethylene glycol mixture was employed as a working fluid for the turbulent flow with Reynolds numbers ranging from 4583 to 35,000. The results indicate that the maximum relative heat transfer is 1.16 and the highest relative friction factor is 1.47 at the lowest Reynolds number tested. For Reynolds numbers less than and equal to 10,136, the thermal hydraulic performance achieved unity. The obtained relative heat transfer is deemed to be poor in comparison to several publications. The swirl flow finally entirely decays after L/D = 70.32 after being visualised through the vortex core and cross-sectional plane of the tube, contributing to a reduced heat transfer performance. In conclusion, TDS performance can be optimised for a lower dimensionless length using the same design configuration, or the design configuration should be modified to increase the generated swirl flow intensity.","['Energy', 'Energy Storage', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering']"

Plenty of numerical schemes can be employed in predicting and analysing the discontinuities flow phenomena that may present in the high-speed flow. These schemes have been integrated into software packages such as Open-source Field Operation and Manipulation (OpenFOAM) and ANSYS, which incorporate a graphical user interface (GUI) that complicates user interaction and are computationally demanding. The previous implementation of the Flux Vector Splitting (FVS) schemes is limited to a typical wave propagating flow only. Hence, the objective of this research is to develop a first-order Flux Vector Splitting (FVS) schemes and extend the solution capabilities to flow with two shocks such as the Woodward-Collela blast wave problem. Three FVS schemes have been selected, Steger-Warming, Van Leer, and Liou-Steffen scheme. Execution of these schemes over the test cases has shown different flow patterns according to each test case's extremities. The ability of the schemes in capturing shock is also analysed. The results over the one-dimensional test cases have shown that the Steger-Warming scheme produced the largest dissipation. In contrast, the Liou-Steffen scheme has shown itself as the most accurate, with very few overshoots and undershoots. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK) method augmented with second-order Time Variation Diminishing (TVD) has been previously implemented but limited to internal flow within a body surface. This research aims to extend the capabilities of the method for previously untested geometries such as flow over a wedge and a blunt-body. The results obtained from the scheme exhibits oblique shock waves at the compression corners and expansion waves at expansion corners. The presence of the waves is apparent at Mach number M∞ = 2.0 for the inlet, wedge, and bump channel geometries, while bow shocks can be simulated using the blunt-body geometry. The results obtained for the one-dimensional and two-dimensional problems confirm the shock-capturing ability of these schemes.","['Engineering', 'Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation']"

A method of associative information retrieval has been developed, based on determining the degree of similarity of text strings by calculating the Levenshtein distance. Similarity criteria between the entered words and words in the database have been developed, which take into account the peculiarities of the Russian language and provide for the possibility of typical errors during entering text from the keyboard. Based on expert assessments of typical keyboard text input errors (case mismatch; erroneous input of characters located nearby on the keyboard, ordinal mismatch of consecutive characters; spelling errors during entering hard and soft vowels, voiced and unvoiced consonants), additional criteria for detection of similarity of 2 characters during calculating the Levenshtein distance have been developed. The method is implemented in a medical decision support system for prescribing drugs in dermatology. Associative search is performed during entering data from the keyboard and forming a request to the “Diagnosis” text field. A test check of the method was carried out, as a result of which various types of distortions of the query word, which may occur during entering this word from the keyboard were performed, and the results of associative search in the database are given. Test verification confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the developed method.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

These services are offered by private operators without any government subsidy and are loosely controlled via paratransit unions in many countries such as India. Poor service quality of these modes creates barriers in the provision of an integrated transit experience. Thus, there is a need for formal regulatory policies or advisory guidelines to improve their service quality by taking into consideration users’ perception. These policies and guidelines can be developed through determining the Level of Service (LOS) scales for different service quality attributes and then determining their priority so that their shortcomings can be addressed. In this research, we extend our earlier work on LOS scale development to determine the priority of various service attributes and their implications in policy formulations for fixed route paratransit services in Kolkata, India. Further, both stated and derived importance techniques are utilised to ensure the inclusion of service aspects that could be adopted in future. RIDIT analysis is applied to estimate the level of importance of attributes from stated importance data and derived importance is determined using the partial log-likelihood (PLL) technique. Unlike earlier studies, this research highlights that improvement of paratransit service operations can be only achieved through the integrated effort of operators, union authorities, regulatory authorities and city officials.","['Engineering', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Sustainable Development']"

The shock response of these systems is of critical importance in their design and must therefore be studied. While experimental investigation of shock response offers accurate results, this approach is costly and requires highly specialized and unique facilities. In contrast, numerical investigation of shock events can be an effective alternative; however, modeling the systems accurately can be challenging. In this paper, the application of Real-Time Hybrid Substructuring (RTHS) to study the system response to a shock event is proposed. RTHS is a cyber-physical testing method, combining both experimental and numerical testing. The RTHS approach is intended to fully incorporate the dynamic interaction between the structure and the excitation source and realistically capture all dynamic phenomena. In this preliminary study of an RTHS shock test, the impact of a swinging pendulum on a mass–spring–damper system is investigated. This highly dynamic event requires precise actuator control and dynamics compensation. This work makes use of a model-based feedforward compensator, namely a minimum phase inverse compensator. To reduce any remaining frequency-dependent time delay or magnitude tracking errors, this compensator is combined with a P-type Iterative Learning Controller. The interaction force profile is studied for varying eigenfrequencies and mass ratios of the impacted mass–spring–damper system. The tests are able to replicate the free vibration response of the system accurately. Despite a good learning performance of the Iterative Learning Control, there are still tracking errors in the initial impact phase. Future work will look to improve actuator control and performance.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Civil Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

However, the tilt-rotor transition on trajectory planning presents a challenge, as performance constraints of different modes must be considered and a trajectory planning algorithm is required to optimize a collision-free and short trajectory with low fuel consumption and small cost. To address these challenges, this paper adds performance constraints of the tilt-rotor UAV to the hybrid algorithm by combining the A* algorithm and the artificial potential field method; meanwhile, the rationality of trajectory planning is improved by setting the tilt-rotor transition region separately in the global.

Therefore, this study aims to identify the relationship between river ecosystems and benthic macroinvertebrate ecological indices for river health assessment. There were a total of five sampling sites selected along Sungai Mengkibol, Sungai Madek and Sungai Dengar in Johor. Benthic macroinvertebrates and six in-situ parameters were collected and measured. Meanwhile, riparian river compositions, canopy cover, large woody debris, substrate compositions and velocity were measured for assessing the river habitat. Ecological indices were analysed and correlated with other parameters. The results obtained reaffirms that river discharge had an influence (p < 0.05) on the composition of the benthic macroinvertebrates caught in the sampling area. Rivers that have reached canopy cover recorded a higher diversity, richness, evenness indices and EPT taxa compared to the least or those of poor canopy cover. The results obtained from the chi-square test shows that there is a significant association (p < 0.05) between physicochemical water quality with dominance index, evenness index and EPT composition.

The bacterial pathogens develop AMR by two types of mechanisms, one is intrinsic resistance due to the mutations in chromosomal genes and another is extrinsic resistance by the acquisition of external plasmid-mediated genes. The key to diagnose AMR lies in the DNA sequence of bacteria harboring the resistance-conferring mechanisms. The advancements in technology have generated a plethora of genomics data that can be utilized for the identification of diagnostic markers. Moreover, machine learning (ML) has created novel opportunities to significantly solve healthcare problems using bioinformatics techniques.

The successful implementation of these algorithms, especially on complex and intricate problems, indicates their importance in artificial intelligence (AI). This review addresses the role of NII in combating infectious diseases using genomic data as well as the future perspective of its use in information processing, decision-making, and optimization for the diagnosis of AMR.

Several studies have demonstrated effectiveness of vibration-based damage identification techniques (VBDITs) in detecting distress in bridges. In such techniques, damage is defined as undesirable changes in the structural dynamic response assessed by comparing its current damaged state to an undamaged reference state. Information from such a reference state may not be available at the time of assessing the current state. Therefore, a reference-free VBDIT has been developed which defines damage as unexpected dissimilarities in the dynamic response of the locations that are anticipated to respond to ambient excitations in a similar manner. To detect and quantify the damage-induced dissimilarities, the technique adopts discrete wavelet transform—a powerful signal decomposition tool—and combines it with spectral entropy through a relative analytical procedure. In this paper, the efficacy of the developed technique is experimentally evaluated through identification of load-induced damage in slab-on-precast concrete girder specimens. Following failure, each damaged specimen was intermittently excited by application of a low-frequency vertical cyclic load. A pair of accelerometers was used to measure vibration signals of the slab and the girder in the vicinity of their connection. The technique was successful in identifying the load-induced damage in the specimens. The results were verified by the test data obtained through extensive instrumentation and visual inspection of the damage. Utilization of this technique can expedite the decision-making process regarding the required repair and maintenance of in-service bridges.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

RS algorithm is very suitable for embedded code transplantation and can quickly generate the shortest parking path due to its low computational complexity, so it is widely used in the parking path planning algorithms.

In order to solve the curvature instantaneous problem of the RS algorithm, this paper proposes a continuous curvature parking path planning algorithm, that is, to optimize and upgrade the RS algorithm with clothoid and straight line, and change the connection of arcs and straight lines used by the RS algorithm to clothoid arcs and straight lines, and so on the basis of retaining the advantages of RS algorithm, it can effectively solve the problem of curvature mutation problem during parking process. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is tested and verified by simulation and real vehicle experiments in two common parking scenarios.

In this study 5% and 10% of Portland cement was replaced with wastepaper sludge ash (WSA) powder. According to particle size distribution of concrete components, WSA improves particle packing and helps to form more dense concrete structure, which is confirmed by improved water absorption and open porosity of the tested concretes. WSA slightly reduces compressive strength of concrete at 28 days of curing. However, flexural strength of concrete with 5% cement replacement at 56 days of hardening is slightly higher than that of control concrete, which can be related to prolonged hydration of WSA.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Sustainable Development', 'Renewable and Green Energy']"

The results of processing the statistical data on the number and causes of downtime for individual SRS are generalized, which made it possible to identify the causes as control parameters in the system of differential equations for all probabilities of states of a closed system of mass maintenance of track machines with a given expectation. The model of controlling the state of track machines in the phase-space of machine complexes, is divided by a hyperplane into two subsets—serviceable and faulty (failure), in which the vector of its states in the process of repair works is subject to fluctuation.

In this type of arrangement, a complex flow interaction exists between wakes from the upper and lower wings, but it has never been focused on in previous research. Thus, this study investigates the effect of wake interaction on the aerodynamics of two coaxial FRWs by using the lattice Boltzmann method and explores the influence of rotation speed, flapping phase difference ( $$\Delta \theta$$ Δ θ ), and wing vertical distance between two wings on the lift and rotating moment, which determine the rotation speed of actual FRW. With inverse flapping (i.e., $$\Delta \theta =\pi$$ Δ θ = π ), the wings interact strongly, and the MAV can reach the maximum rotating moment. An increase in vertical distance between the two wings and rotation speed can weaken the interaction. Our design allows for high rotating speed and low wing loads, thereby reducing the torque requirements on the motor. This study can enhance our understanding of the complex wake interaction produced by multiple FRWs at low Reynolds numbers and provide theoretical guidance for the design of MAVs, especially FRW MAVs.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

This article outlines the influence of soil consistency on the pullout behavior of plate anchors buried in reinforced clay. The experimental tests are carried out in unreinforced and reinforced soil conditions at different consistency index of soil ( I c  = 0.15 to 0.6). The square plate anchors are placed at embedment ratios (H/B) 1 to 6 and loaded vertically. In reinforced soil conditions, a single-layer reinforcement in the form of a geotextile sheet is positioned at a depth of 0.25  H above the anchor, where H is the embedment depth of the plate anchor measured from the ground surface. The size of geotextile sheet is taken as four times the width of the anchor plate. The embedded plate anchor is subjected to monotonic pull, at a rate of loading 3.5 mm/min. The applied displacement and the corresponding pullout loads are recorded. The variation of pullout capacity and breakout factors with embedment ratios and consistency index are presented. It is found that the inclusion of geotextile reinforcement increases the resistance against pullout load with less ultimate displacement of anchor. The ultimate pullout capacity of the plate anchor was considerably enhanced with an increase in the consistency index of the soil.","['Engineering', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Building Materials', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences']"

The A1050-H14 aluminum alloy of 0.8 mm sheet thickness was adopted. Elastic-plastic 3D finite element (FE) models with orthotropic anisotropy assumption were developed. The anisotropic plastic behavior of the aluminum alloy was modeled by using the Hill’s 1948 yield criterion (also called Hill48 criterion). To identify the initial yield stress and the strain-hardening of the material, two reference directions such as the rolling direction (RD) and the transverse direction (TD) were tested. The Hill’s coefficients were determined under plane stresses condition of tensile test and the use of experimental r-values. For comparison, other isotropic 3D FE models, governed by the von Mises criterion, were carried out. The load-displacement relationship and the final shape of deformed flange were predicted. The thickness measured at the end of the flange for 0 $$^{\circ }$$ ∘ and 90 $$^{\circ }$$ ∘ was controlled by varying the clearance between the punch and the die. The corresponding evolutions of thickness showed that the occurrence of ironing is dependent to the sheet orientation. The validation by some experimental results demonstrated that the best prediction is attributed to the orthotropic anisotropy assumption referring to the TD.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Materials Engineering', 'Classical and Continuum Physics']"

Identification, characterization, and detection of damages at the early stages in a plate structure avoid the further growth of damages and prevent the structural failure. In this paper, the strain energy and flexibility matrix-based damage detection procedure is adopted to detect single as well multiple damages in a plate structure. Toward this, a 4-noded plate element is utilized to discretize the rectangular plate with 6° of freedom (dof) at every node. The flexibility matrix is calculated using the natural frequency and mode shape. This method detects the damage in the plate by an increase in flexibility matrix of the damaged one. The damage indicator is then computed by evaluating the changes in strain energy of a structural plate using the coefficients of the flexibility matrices. The modal parameters were extracted from the FE analysis software Abaqus. Nine illustrative examples with damages at various locations are induced by decreasing the modulus of elasticity at the specified elements in plate structure, in order to determine the effectiveness of the method. The numerical result shows that the adopted damage detection procedure can be able to locate the structural damages in plates with lower modes, and the magnitude of the evaluated damage index depends on the severity of the damage.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Building Materials']"

The dependence of the time of complete emptying on the shape of the vessel was found. A feature was observed when the liquid flows out of the paraboloid: the uniformity of the level decrease and the deformation of the free surface. To explain such an anomaly of the process of outflow from a vessel of a parabolic shape, a hydrodynamic model is proposed based on the idea of the movement of particles of an ideal liquid through current tubes of various curvature that completely fill the volume of the paraboloid. Analytical expressions of the main kinematic parameters of the outflow (emptying time, acceleration of liquid particles), as well as the equation of the deformed free surface and its rate of decrease are obtained. The proposed work provides for a series of experiments on emptying vessels of various geometric shapes of the same overall dimensions, as well as a description of the results obtained using a hydrodynamic model based on the flow of liquid through curved current tubes.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology', 'Building Materials']"

While the overall concept of emotional labor has gained acceptance over time (Grandey and Gabriel in Annual Review of Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behavior 2:323–349, 2015), these distinctions have created challenges for researchers studying emotional labor (Callahan and McCollum in Managing emotions in the workplace , Routledge, 2002b).

Limitations of post-hurricane debris removal resources often impede the timely debris removal operation for recovery, thereby intensifying the impact of a disaster. In such trying situations, the planning of temporary debris management sites (TDMS), to serve as designed buffers for the sorting, storing, and processing of debris becomes important for the resilience of a local debris management system. This study develops a framework to find the optimal locations for TDMSs, which meet geographic requirements (i.e., related to their land use, land cover, and proximity to natural and built environments) while minimizing the threats imposed to the communities health and safety due to delayed debris removal operations. Specifically, we performed a geographic information system (GIS) analysis to find possible locations for TDMSs based on various geographic requirements by federal government agencies, such as the US EPA and FEMA. Further, we developed a simulation model to evaluate debris removal performance with various TDMS site options in a post-hurricane planning scenario. Using the AnyLogic Optimization Experiment, the optimal TDMS locations were explored in a way that minimizes the overall debris collection time and adverse impacts on community health. To demonstrate the implementation of the proposed framework, we investigated as a case study the debris removal operation for Liberty County, Florida, in response to a hypothetical hurricane event.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

In the current paper, a new technique is proposed, which meets the industry's desires to reduce drag and save pumping energy by mounting small streamlined protrusions in the pipe’s short segments’ inner wall. The protrusions are functioning as turbulence modifiers by changing the turbulence structure in the flow near the wall. Series of experimental measurements were carried out using two configurations of TMs in 0.0572-m-diameter GI pipe, with water flow covering Reynolds number range from 55,000 to 110,000. The current study focuses on the effect of the population of the TMs on drag reduction. The results demonstrated drag reduction in the low population case, which has 30 TMs separated by 4.8 mm, by approximately 6.3%. The high population case showed an increase in drag. However, it is possible to push the boundary for drag reduction efficiency limit by further investigation of configurations of TMs. It is highly recommended to investigate the technique with a different population and more geometries of the turbulence modifiers.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks', 'Energy Storage']"

To ensure sufficient load-bearing capacity of structures despite these changes, actions may be monitored using structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. Environmental actions involve time-dependent and non-scheduled loads, e.g., wind and snow loads. In current SHM systems, these loads are mostly traced locally. However, local monitoring may cause inaccuracies, as certain load phenomena, such as wind turbulences, or snow accumulations in specific parts of structures, may not be registered. A holistic, global recording of loads acting on structures has rarely been established since a multitude of sensors is cost intensive, and the integration into the building envelope is challenging. This paper investigates slender layered piezoresistive sensors to measure loads resulting from environmental actions, focusing on wind and snow loads. The sensors operate based on changes of externally applied pressure, leading to variations in the electrical resistance of a piezoresistive material. Next to strategies for quantifying structural loads using sensor technology, first, alternatives of force sensors are discussed. Subsequently, the low-cost technical fabrication of the piezoresistive pressure sensors is presented, and implementation, calibration, and validation of the pressure sensors are conducted. Finally, the validation results of the sensors are discussed, and an outlook on future work is presented. In summary, the sensors investigated offer a wide range of applications for monitoring structural actions on surfaces, serving as a basis for estimating the load-bearing capacity of structures reliably.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

NIRS has been widely adopted as a monitor of the adequacy of brain tissue oxygenation in anesthesiology and critical care medicine and is also used intraoperatively to monitor the perfusion of the spinal cord and some other somatic vascular beds. Measurements of rScO 2 are affected by patient factors, disease states, physiologic alterations, and the variable technology and algorithms incorporated in the design of commercial monitors. It is essential that clinicians understand the technology that underlies NIRS-based cerebral oximetry so that monitoring data can be interpreted correctly. Cerebral oximetry is influenced by a variety of physiologic inputs that can alert clinicians to dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) and other vital organs.

In an HDS, the two categories of dynamics with disparate time scales are assumed to be coupled through slowly varying system parameters. PSW was proposed as a practical algorithm to process sampled field measurement data, which has a lower dimensionality than the total number of system states, and resolve the hidden dynamics through nonlinear time series analysis. Since its introduction, PSW has been used successfully in many engineering applications. These applications range from estimating of slow-time multivariate parameter drifts in electromechanical systems, identifying physiological fatigue, to tracking and characterizing damage evolution in mechanical and biomechanical systems. PSW tries to resolve the underlying slow-time dynamics by investigating how the original high-dimensional fast-time nonlinear dynamical system’s manifold changes over a longer period of time over which the slow subsystem’s effects kick in. Despite its success in the applications mentioned above, there is no systematic discussion regarding selecting the parameters to ensure a reasonably good estimation of the underlying slow-time dynamics. Furthermore, there were six variables involved in the original PSW algorithm, randomly selecting these parameters takes one almost infinite amount of time to figure out a somewhat optimal set of parameters P $$\mathcal {P}$$ to make the tracking work. The PSW algorithm has a solid theoretical background but may seem like a gray-box to a black-box data-driven method if one uses it for the first time. Practitioners definitely should not anticipate a random set of parameters to work out, and they may get lost in searching for such a set of parameters. As a primer study, this extended abstract tries to provide a rough strategy to systematically select a set of parameters that yields reasonably good or even optimal tracking results. First, a brief graphical illustration of how the PSW algorithm works is discussed. Then, simulations with various types of fast-time and slow-time dynamics will be conducted to guide parameter selection. These systems are well-known nonlinear oscillators derived from mechanical and electrical systems to make the illustrations approachable. Simulations with known damage dynamics are conducted to further illustrate the power of PSW algorithm when an optimal parameter set is used.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Automotive Engineering']"

A more and more popular solution to this problem consists in applying obfuscating techniques, in particular at the source code level. Informally, the goal of obfuscation is to conceal the purpose of a program or its logic without altering its functionality, thus preventing reverse-engineering on the program even with the help of computing resources. This allows to protect software against plagiarism, tampering, or finding vulnerabilities that could be used for different kinds of attacks. The many advantages of code obfuscation, together with its low cost, makes it a popular technique. This paper proposes a novel methodology for source code obfuscation relying on the reference LLVM compiler infrastructure that can be used together with other traditional obfuscation techniques, making the code more robust against reverse engineering attacks. The problem is defined as a Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization (MOCO) problem, where the goal is to find sequences of LLVM optimizations that lead to highly obfuscated versions of the original code. These transformations are applied to the back-end pseudo-assembly code ( i.e. , LLVM Intermediate Representation), thus avoiding any further optimizations by the compiler. Three different problem flavours are defined and solved with popular NSGA-II genetic algorithm. The promising results show the potential of the proposed technique.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Education, general']"

The impacts of cutting parameters such as feed rate, cutting speed, and depth of cut on output responses such as cutting forces, flank wear, and surface roughness were investigated using a Box-Behnken design based on response surface methodology (RSM). To find the optimum cutting condition, a newly developed hybrid optimization method, namely RSM-linked Artificial Gorilla Troop Optimization Algorithm and Dingo Optimization Algorithm, was utilized. The flank wear along with cutting force was recorded when the depth of cut was less while better surface finish was achieved with lower cutting speed. Additionally, analysis of variance was used to determine the most important component in each of the three responses, followed by a confirmatory test that revealed a high degree of agreement between anticipated and experimental results.

In order to solve the problem that traffic flow is difficult to predict because of the sharp nonlinearity and randomness, a deep learning framework, i.e., the temporal convolutional network (TCN) was explored to capture the nonlinear spatiotemporal characteristics of traffic flow. By adjusting the hyper-parameters of TCN, a traffic flow predictor is proposed. Besides, this paper adopts a method to calculate the designated cross-section traffic volume of freeways from toll data, which makes up for the inability to obtain traffic volume at some cross-section locations due to damage or lack of traffic detection equipment. Through data merging, data cleaning, data reconstruction, data filtering, a traffic flow data set which was selected as the data input with a time interval of 15 min was constructed based on the toll data of Shaanxi Province freeway network from December 2018 to April 2019 as the data source. The TCN model was compared with the SVM, SAE, LSTM and GRU models in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). The prediction results of multiple cross-sections showed the TCN model performs best with superior prediction accuracy, which indicate the TCN model has good robustness and generalization ability. The traffic volume calculation algorithm may provide a practical method for deriving the traffic volume without installing any additional regularly maintained detectors and equipment on the freeway.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-16075-2_17,en,Computing with Words for Industrial Applications,OriginalPaper,"More and more industrial applications are facing the problem of imprecise information handling. Computing with Words (CW) is a mathematical model for approximate knowledge representation, reasoning, and processing of natural language. The very basic idea of CW is to use words instead of numbers for computing and reasoning using fuzzy sets and logic. However, the implementation of this approach in the project requires certain knowledge. This paper presents our initial efforts towards building of a methodology and library based on the extended version of CW, CWiPy. CWiPy can be effectively used to apply CW techniques easily without any prior knowledge in this field. So, developers can add it to an existing system and use it as a black box (plug and play). In CWiPy, the traditional CW was extended to process a bigger variety of linguistic hedges, enhancing the system expressiveness. CWiPy provides an API that allows handling of fuzzy variables, sets, hedges, and quantifiers. Results show that CWiPY can be easily applied in real-life industrial applications to deal with imprecise information and provide help for experts. Two different usage scenarios of the library are presented as a proof of concept: natural language query processing and database summarization .","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Drawing in the classroom as a knowledge transfer strategy in theory instruction has not yet been explored in the literature. In both the applied and empirical literature, we found only two documented cases that specifically refer to teacher-generated drawing as a strategy. It is argued that teacher involvement in strategy through practice creates a stimulating environment for instruction by practicing collaborative drawing between teachers and learners. Involving both through joint and simultaneous drawing allows for a more inclusive classroom environment by allowing for interpretation and visual communication of theoretical content during oral presentation. We experienced the strategy in 3 different classes at an external higher education institution to explore teaching practice. In order not to bias the results, we used students completely unknown to the researcher. The outlined method approaches a theoretical content by creating representative drawings during class. At the end of each experience session, the evaluation of the impact of the strategy was collected from the students through a questionnaire survey that intersected with the empirical qualitative survey conducted by the session's follow-up researcher. It was concluded that the teacher-generated drawing strategy works by enabling playful learning through its differentiating approach and challenging students in theoretical lessons with something they do not expect, thus optimizing motivation and understanding of the content. It provides feedback to the teacher so that he can clear or clarify any doubts.","['Architecture / Design', 'Industrial Design', 'Digital/New Media', 'Structural Materials', 'Music']"

LLPS plays a critical role in the cell through the formation of membrane-less organelles, but it also has a number of biotechnical and biomedical applications such as drug confinement and its targeted delivery. In this chapter, we present a computational efficient methodology that uses field-theoretic simulations (FTS) with complex Langevin (CL) sampling to characterize polymer phase behavior and delineate the LLPS phase boundaries. This approach is a powerful complement to analytical and explicit-particle simulations, and it can serve to inform experimental LLPS studies. The strength of the method lies in its ability to properly sample a large ensemble of polymers in a saturated solution while including the effect of composition fluctuations on LLPS. We describe the approaches that can be used to accurately construct phase diagrams of a variety of molecularly designed polymers and illustrate the method by generating an approximation-free phase diagram for a classical symmetric diblock polyampholyte.","['Life Sciences', 'Biochemistry, general', 'Bioinformatics']"

Also, because most welding robot applications are taught and played, they must be reconfigured each time they engage in a new duty. This takes time, and welding settings must be improvised for each new weld job. Hence, this study addresses these concerns by proposing an alternate way of automatically recognizing weld joint types. This paper suggests an effective way to classify the weld joint type using the feature extraction technique. This research aims to create a fusion model that uses sophisticated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to recognize Welding joints from a dataset. The suggested hybrid model incorporates the essential characteristics of both; the CNN and the SVM classifier. In this fusion model, CNN is an automated feature extractor, while SVM serves as a classifier. The model is trained and tested using the Kaggle Weld joint dataset (for Butt and Tee Joint) and an in-house dataset (for Vee and lap weld joint). The collection comprises a variety of weld joint photos captured from various perspectives. CNN’s receptive field aids in the automated extraction of the most distinguishing aspects of these images. The experimental findings show that the suggested framework is successful, with a recognition accuracy of 99.7% over the mentioned dataset. Accuracy is determined using the k-fold cross-validation method, where k = 10.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

By introducing second- and third-order nonlinear terms (opposite in sign) into diffusion coefficient matrices, bistable energy or mass diffusion occurs with two different steady states, identified as “0” and “1”. In particular, we study heat conduction in a two-terminal three-body system. This bistable system exhibits a macro-scale thermal memory effect with tailored nonlinear thermal conductivities. Finite-element simulations confirm the theoretical analysis. Also, we suggest experiments with metamaterials based on shape memory alloys. This framework blazes a trail in constructing intrinsic bistability or multistability in diffusive systems for macroscopic energy or mass management.","['Physics', 'Optics, Lasers, Photonics, Optical Devices', 'Thermodynamics', 'Optical and Electronic Materials', 'Materials Science, general', 'Theoretical, Mathematical and Computational Physics', 'Condensed Matter Physics']"

Today, the Greenhouse farming rate is increasing due to the protection of crops from diseases, increasing production, minimizing production, stability and security, etc. But there are many possible ways that insects can enter greenhouse farms. So protecting the crops in a greenhouse farm will be so difficult for a farmer to spray insecticide, and the growth rate of crops will also be decreased. To decrease the burden, this automatic insecticide sprayer will be helpful to do insecticides. In this device, we use a motion sensor to detect the motion of harmful flies which entered the greenhouse farm. Since the device was automatic, there will be no need for farmers to take care of plants to protect them from insects. In this device, we used solenoid valves. It helps us to spray insecticides only in the detected region and in the other regions spraying will not be done, and we can save the wastage of insecticide.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer']"

The proposed procedure relies upon surrogate modeling based on a multi-fidelity (MF) deep neural network (DNN), conceived to map damage and operational parameters onto sensor recordings. Within a stochastic framework, the MF-DNN is adopted by a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling procedure to update the probability distribution of the structural state, conditioned on noisy observations. The MF-DNN enables to locate and possibly quantify the presence of damage, and its multi-fidelity configuration effectively blends datasets featuring different fidelities without any prior assumption. The training datasets are generated with physics-based models of the monitored structure: high fidelity (HF) and low fidelity (LF) models are considered to simulate the structural response under varying operational conditions, respectively in the presence or absence of a structural damage. The MF-DNN is a composition of a fully-connected LF-DNN, which mimics sensor recordings in the undamaged condition, and of a long short-term memory HF-DNN, which is exploited to enrich the LF approximation for the considered damaged scenarios. By framing the model updating strategy as an incremental or residual modeling problem, the MF-DNN is reported to provide numerous advantages over single-fidelity based models for SHM purposes.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Electric machines of this type are in demand in various fields of industry due to the simplicity of design, high reliability, long service life, low cost of manufacture and rather good indicators of energy efficiency. However, despite the undeniable advantages of this type of electric motor, there are also disadvantages that do not allow increasing its competitiveness. To eliminate gaps at the design stage, these studies were conducted aimed at changing the geometry of the operating part of the switched reluctance machine so that the result was a decrease in the electromagnetic torque ripple and material consumption. Reducing the material consumption of the operating part of the motor of this type will reduce costs for the manufacturer, increase profit and profitability of production. The calculated indicators of economic efficiency—net present value and internal rate of return—allow us to make a conclusion about the economic feasibility of the project for the production of the switched reluctance motor in the case of modernizing these design features. Thus, a positive economic effect is created at the stage of production of these motors.

An important aspect to consider in writing is an adequate segmentation of ideas, which in turn requires a proper understanding of where to place paragraph breaks. However, these decisions are often performed intuitively, with little systematicity in sequencing ideas. Thus, an automated method of detecting the optimal hierarchical structure of texts using quantifiable features could be a valuable tool for learners. Here, we aim to define a framework grounded in Cohesion Network Analysis to establish the structure of a text by modeling paragraphs as clusters of sentences. The analogy to clustering enables us to identify paragraph breaks that maximize inter-paragraph separation while ensuring high intra-paragraph cohesion. Our approach consists of two steps acted on texts without paragraph breaks. First, the number of paragraphs is automatically inferred with an absolute error of 1.02 using a Recurrent Neural Network, which relies on text features and cohesion flow. Second, paragraph splits are detected using two algorithms: top k which selects the largest cohesion gaps between adjacent utterances, and divisive clustering which iteratively splits the text into paragraphs.

This study aimed to simulate implantation process and evaluate the press-fit effect imposed at this stage on the primary stability outcome. The femur was modeled as an elasto-plastic material with element deletion based on cumulation of plastic strain represented as damage. The implantation phase was simulated using a displacement constraint that led to implant self-positioning by frictional contact. A subsequent force-controlled, loading-unloading cycle corresponding to the peak of a gait cycle was applied. Implantation force and work, implant subsidence and relative micromotions during the loading cycle were quantified. The modeling strategy was performed on two levels of hypothetical initial press-fit to capture the extreme influence of press-fit on the subsequent outcomes. The implantation force was 21.5% higher for the high press-fit approach. The implant remained more stable during the loading cycle for low press-fit model based on subsidence values. Micromotions showed also a significant dependency on press-fit. The median values of micromotions were below 150 µm for both press-fit models, which is in good agreement with the literature.

The porosity effect is included in material modelling by means of modified rule of mixture. The in-plane edge loads acting on plates are seldom uniform in nature during the operational condition. And hence, vibration and stability characteristics of the FGM plates comprising porosity is analyzed considering nonlinearly varying in-plane edge load incorporating Finite element (FE) method. The numerical outcomes obtained are compared to those reported in the literature to help decide the formulation's correctness. The effect of geometric configuration, volume fraction exponent, porosity and loading on vibration and stability characteristics of FGM plate member with porosity is investigated.","['Materials Science', 'Structural Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

Restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic made it very difficult or impossible for laboratory classes to take place, resulting on a fast transition to simulation as an approach to guarantee the effectiveness of teaching. Simulation environments are powerful tools that can be adopted for remote classes and self-study. With these tools, students can perform experiments and, in some cases, make use of the laboratory facilities from outside of the University. This paper proposes and describes two free tools developed during the COVID-19 pandemic lock-down that allowed students to work from home, namely a set of simulation experiments and a Hardware-in-the-loop simulator, accessible 24/7. Two approaches in Python and C languages are presented, both in the context of Robotics courses for Engineering students.

The electrical resistivity (R) was measured in dog bone specimens after a thermo-mechanical aging (TMA). Then, it was predicted in diabolo tests samples. The diffusion limited oxidation (DLO) effects on the resistivity evolution is taken into account by replacing the aging time “ t ” by an equivalent time “t eq ”. The DLO was described by the basic fickian reactive diffusion model. The thick specimens, TMA treated, was cut into nearly equal thickness layers, to measure the electrical resistance from the surface to the bulk of the sample. Some of the key observations from the experiments is the decrease of (R) with the increase of CB amount and TMA time. The R evolution pointed the presence of thermally activated degradation in the material (scission-formation mechanisms/fillers and chains movement). The electrical resistivity profile in cylindrical hourglass-shaped specimen elucidate a heterogeneous oxidative process due to oxygen diffusion/consumption through the material. This fact suggest that DLO has a strong effect on carbon black aggregate movement and formation in the material matrix. The predictive ability of the model shows a good agreement with the experimental measurements.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Materials Engineering', 'Classical and Continuum Physics']"

doi:10.1007/124_2021_55,en,Movement of Aquatic Oxygenic Photosynthetic Organisms,OriginalPaper,"Many phytoplankton organisms are denser than their aquatic medium, and so sink relative to the surrounding water. Decreasing cell density relative to the medium allows upward movement, using gas vesicles in cyanobacteria and decreasing the density of the vacuole in large-celled eukaryotes. Upward movement can also occur in organisms with flagella. These three mechanisms can maintain the organisms in the photic zone with a small estimated minimum energy cost relative to those of cell growth (<0.2% in eukaryotic algae and cyanobacteria). When there is limited circulatory water movement in the upper mixed layer the capacity for upward movement relative to surrounding water allows the possibility of periodic vertical migration, making use of opposing gradients of the resources of photon flux density (high near the surface) and nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron (high near the chemocline). For non-flagellate organisms, increased density is needed for the downward portion of the migration. Periodic vertical migration also occurs for flagellates near the surface of muddy or sandy substrates, avoiding excessive light or the possibility of removal in overlying water in tidal habitants. Such movements are also possible in these habitats, and microbial mats on rocky substrata, for cyanobacteria and pennate diatoms with gliding motility. Estimates of the minimum energy cost of periodic vertical migration in these benthic habitats are again a small fraction (10 −4 %) of the estimated minimum energy cost of growth. High frequency variations in sinking rate of a planktonic marine diatom appear to require a larger fraction of the energy used in cell growth (probably at least 16%) than other mechanisms considered here. The limited data available suggests that the lack of flagella on male gametes of algae (rhodophytes), have little effect on outbreeding and algae diversification. Other dispersal mechanisms (seagrass pollen, wave-driven macrophyte movement) affecting algae outbreeding are discussed.","['Life Sciences', 'Plant Sciences', 'Forestry', 'Plant Biochemistry', 'Ecosystems', 'Plant Genetics and Genomics', 'Plant Physiology']"

The efficiency of COVID-19 diagnosis has become highly significant. As deep learning and convolutional neural network (CNN) has been widely utilized and been verified in analyzing medical images, it has become a powerful tool for computer-assisted diagnosis. However, there are two most significant challenges in medical image classification with the help of deep learning and neural networks, one of them is the difficulty of acquiring enough samples, which may lead to model overfitting. Privacy concerns mainly bring the other challenge since medical-related records are often deemed patients’ private information and protected by laws such as GDPR and HIPPA. Federated learning can ensure the model training is decentralized on different devices and no data is shared among them, which guarantees privacy. However, with data located on different devices, the accessible data of each device could be limited. Since transfer learning has been verified in dealing with limited data with good performance, therefore, in this paper, We made a trial to implement federated learning and transfer learning techniques using CNNs to classify COVID-19 using lung CT scans. We also explored the impact of dataset distribution at the client-side in federated learning and the number of training epochs a model is trained. Finally, we obtained very high performance with federated learning, demonstrating our success in leveraging accuracy and privacy.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

However, the interaction between mechanical and flow condition that occurs in the peripheral artery using independent computational model of cardiovascular system is still poorly resolved. This study aimed to systematically review the recent progress on the implementation of CFD and FSI in PAD from 2017 to 2021.

Lack of directly available field performance data is mitigated using a high-fidelity finite element model and a probabilistic understanding of the aerodynamic loads under different flight regimes, simulating realizations of the spar’s performance in service. Debonding damage between laminates was included in the model at different locations in the spar, with various damage sizes. Under the expectation of a fiber optic measurement system being used for data collection, the target measurements are uniaxial strain, measured in several paths throughout the spar. Given measured strain, the damage assessment problem is probabilistically formulated by defining local buckling from debonding as the observable damage, which is fundamentally characterized by load-dependent buckling eigenvalues. This FE physical model is highly computationally intensive, so machine learning was used to build a “run time” surrogate model to learn the relationships between inputs – loads and damage conditions, and outputs – strain and buckling eigenvalues. In addition, other surrogate models were created to solve the inverse problem, linking strain data to damage classification (size and location). Finally, the probabilistic frameworks are demonstrated and damage criticality assessment, which is directly related to the buckling load, is performed via Gaussian process regression.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

doi:10.1007/124_2022_57,en,Evolution of Holobiont-Like Systems: From Individual to Composed Ecological and Global Units,OriginalPaper,"Higher Plants or Animals with microbial companions constitute holobionts, being spatiotemporal interaction networks as (co-)evolutionary selection units. As intrinsic interaction patterns also prevail at hierarchically different scales of ecological organization, organismic associations scale-invariantly represent holobiont-like systems (HLSs). This essay explores how high-ranking HLSs (ecosystems, biosphere) do evolve, in particular, under the conventionally gene-centric view at the Darwinian principles of mutation, heredity, and selection. Re-visiting evolution theory, shortcomings by DNA-restricted interpretations impede perceptions of HLS evolution, notably, at hierarchically high ecological scales. Any HLS is discernable as a selection unit, however, through considering genericness by widening DNA-encoded to structurally and functionally stored information upon historical contingencies in “E vo D evo E co ” processes, relating evolution, development, and ecology. On such grounds, HLS evolution proceeds through adaptive cycling and sequential selection, examining predictability versus stochasticity of aggregated information for adaptiveness to environmental variation. Each turn mirroring evolutionary advancement, cycling does not require resource-related competition as evolutionary driver. However, selection is reflected in competition in a sense of facing the challenge to maintain internal stability upon environmental changes. Such challenge becomes evident also in biospheric HLS Earth evolution through traded contingency effects upon manifold biogeochemical impacts. Although repeatedly inciting global species mass extinctions, such were pulse generators towards niches diversification and ecological complexity, owed to recurrent valuing scrutiny of sequential selection. Abandoning gene-centric perspectives, HLS evolution is borne by oscillating phases of consolidation versus renewal.","['Life Sciences', 'Plant Sciences', 'Forestry', 'Plant Biochemistry', 'Ecosystems', 'Plant Genetics and Genomics', 'Plant Physiology']"

The specific portions (information nuggets) of such documents may talk about specific aspects, and similar aspects of information can be seen across top k retrieved documents. We have proposed an information retrieval framework using the fine-tuned BERT model that identifies such aspects across top k documents and identifies such aspect based information in the form of information nuggets. Similar information nuggets are clustered based on their contextual relevance to specific aspects of the query. This work also applies topic-assisted query expansion to prune the final retrieved set of information nuggets, and the final retrieved set of information covers diverse aspects of user information needs.

The CMD is a recently proposed method that extracts single mode components from measured multimodal free structural responses. These components can be then processed, in time domain or in frequency domain, for identification of modal parameters, and ultimately, for structural health monitoring. The aim of the CMD is thus similar to the aims of other well-known mode decomposition approaches, such as the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) or the variational mode decomposition (VMD). However, in contrast to the EMD, the CMD-processed responses retain the characteristics of the free response (satisfy the equation of motion of the same structure) and they have thus a clear, well-defined physical meaning. In comparison to the VMD, the formulation of the CMD is much simpler: the CMD combines linearly recorded structural responses in a way that simultaneously (1) amplifies the selected modal component and (2) constrains/suppresses other components. The amplification/suppression process is quantified in terms of the FRF peaks or, in case of closely spaced modes, in terms of FRF derivatives.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Training data can be simulated using physics-based models. However, this is dependent on model verification and validation (V&V), meaning assembly-level data is still required. Hierarchical V&V is a novel technique in the field of SHM. The aim of hierarchical V&V is to remove the necessity for assembly-level validation data. Instead, the process entails the V&V of subassembly-level models, which are then combined to produce an assembly-level model using dynamic substructuring (DS). This simplifies the data acquisition process in order to reduce the associated difficulties and costs. This paper focuses on the role of DS in the hierarchical V&V process for SHM. DS allows substructures to be used to create an assembly model, and for simultaneous uncertainty propagation. This allows confidence to be established in the assembled models without requiring assembly-level data.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

This paper presents methods to solve this problem. Specifically, the shortest path between two given points in the 3D space of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is generated, and the generated path is traced. Moreover, the designed controller is introduced. The path generation algorithm is based on the existing path generation algorithm pertaining to the Dubins curve. The path generated by this algorithm can satisfy the constraints regarding the minimum allowable turning radius; moreover, the algorithm involves rapid computation and can be applied for path generation in real time. Notably, in this algorithm, the shortest path to fixed initial and final points is geometrically obtained in a 2D plane; however, real aircraft path generation problems must be implemented in 3D. Therefore, a path in 3D space is generated by deriving a solution through a numerical technique, using the same principle as that of the problem in 2D. Furthermore, the line-of-sight guidance algorithm corresponds to basic waypoint guidance. The proposed 3D path tracking approach is implemented using a nonlinear controller, resembling those of line-of-sight guidance algorithms. The controller guarantees, under certain assumptions, asymptotic tracking of the path, in terms of both the position and attitude. Finally, we adopt a sliding mode controller, which is a robust controller that can ensure high control performance and stability even under uncertainties. The proposed controller satisfies the constraint through the saturation function, specifically, by introducing the constraint on the angular velocity to the existing sliding mode controller. The stability of the designed controller is verified considering Lyapunov stability, and the performance of the proposed algorithm is verified through numerical simulation.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

However, running of thermal power plant results into the release of objectionable pollutants. One way to have a control on these pollutants is the use of renewable energy sources like solar and wind. However, these sources are intermittently available and hence it is important that the quick backup and balancing is needed when renewable source is not available. In these situations, use of gas turbine is a good option. This paper considers the numerical analysis of the combined intercooled, reheat and regenerative cycle. Objective of this work was to develop ANN model, understand the various parameters, there effect on gas turbine performance and optimize the cycle parameters for maximum efficiency. Analysis shows that for turbine inlet temperature 1200 K and compressor inlet temperature 293 K the optimum pressure ratio is 9 and thermal efficiency is 32%. Analysis of the gas turbine cycle was performed for different pressure ratio, turbine inlet temperature, compressor inlet temperature, and heat exchanger effectiveness. Data obtained from the analysis was then used for the development of the prediction model using artificial neural network. The developed model has root mean square error equal to 0.00018 and the regression coefficient of the trained network is 0.99. This way the developed mathematical model was validated, and it has a good predictability.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Their main advantages are in the precision and speed of the cut over relatively thick plates and the cleanliness and quality of the welds and coatings. Plasma torches used for cutting and welding are generally of relatively low power, 10 to 40 kW. Their design is based on the use of a hot cathode, operating in a transferred arc mode, with the part to be cut or welded acting as the anode to make use of the high heat fluxes associated with anode root arc attachments. Cutting and welding torches differ, however, in their performance objectives and accordingly in the nature of the plasma gas used. Cutting torches tend to use essentially oxidizing gases at high flow rates in order to enhance the cutting efficiency and get rid of metal dross, while welding torches use inert or reducing atmosphere in order to avoid contamination of the weld spot with debris of metal oxide. Plasma torches used for PTA coating also operate in the transferred arc mode to create a pool of molten metal at the coating location in which the coating materials in the form of a fine powder are uniformly dispersed. Once the molten metal cools and freezes, it creates a metal matrix composite coating, which is often used in hard facing or rebuilding of worn-off parts.","['Engineering', 'Materials Engineering', 'Tribology, Corrosion and Coatings', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Plasma Physics']"

These structures are submitted repetitively to loads such as strong winds, varying temperatures, and increasing roadway or railway traffic. The trainload accounts for a relatively significant portion of the fatigue of critical members. Usually, trains consist of different numbers of carriages, and they cause different levels of stress. Consequently, the induced fatigue damage varies accordingly. This paper proposes an adaptive multi-category train schedule validation approach based on fatigue reliability using bridge monitoring data. The method involves three steps. Firstly, the typical train categories are identified based on long-term train weigh-in-motion (WIM) data, and their percentages are obtained. Secondly, the stress responses under each type of train are collected to establish a database, and fatigue damage is calculated to generate the probability density distribution. Thirdly, the number of different types of trains can be obtained for a typical train daily schedule, and the fatigue damage is calculated and checked with the design fatigue life. The case study of a suspension bridge is used to verify the approach, and conclusions are drawn from the perspective of the bridge management.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The active vibration control (AVC) has been widely used in the field of vibration damping in rotary structures. In this article, deriving analytical solution of lateral vibration and active vibration control of a wind turbine (WT) blade are investigated. First, a new semi-analytical solution is developed to obtain the lateral deflection of a wind turbine blade under external loadings. We propose a method to map a wind turbine blade to an Euler-Bernoulli beam with the same conditions, in order to find vibration and dynamic responses of the blade by solving analytical vibration solutions of the Euler-Bernoulli beam. Piezoelectric (PZT) material is used in this research as an actuator-sensor to excite the structures and sense the responses. The governing equations of the beam with piezoelectric patches are derived based on the integration of the piezoelectric transducer vibration equations into the vibration equations of the Euler-Bernoulli beam structure. Finite element model of the wind turbine blade with piezoelectric patches is developed. A unique transfer function matrix is derived. The beam structure is projected to the blade by using a unique transfer function matrix which is derived by exciting the structures and achieving responses. The results obtained from the mapping method are compared with the results achieved from the FE model of the blade. A satisfying agreement has been observed between the results. Next, in order to suppress the transverse vibration of the wind turbine blade, piezoelectric ceramic patches are used as an actuator in combination with linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control system. The obtained results show that the proposed smart control system contains PZT patches and LQR control system is able to efficiently suppress lateral vibration.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Solid Construction', 'Complexity', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Structural Materials']"

However, these models are usually not continuous, which could make convergence difficult. Moreover, they can be difficult to tackle when using expression graphs to calculate derivatives (e.g., when using automatic differentiation) during the resolution of optimization problems. This is due to the computational need to use branches when dealing with conditionals. This study presents a mesh-based contact model adapted to deal with gradient-based optimizations and automatic differentiation. A tracking example of a knee prosthesis contact, integrated into a full-body muscle-driven model, is presented. Kinematics and dynamics data were tracked during an overground gait trial. The results show that the accuracy of knee contact force estimations is comparable to other studies (RMSE medial contact force = 50.8 N, RMSE lateral = 81.6 N), and the computational time (3 h and 20 min) is acceptable to be run in a conventional PC.

Inspired by the previous study of a cone-derived waverider conceptual design that achieved a significant increase in of lift-to-drag ratio ( $$L/D$$ L / D ), a concave study is examined on the waverider (supersonic) configuration. The main purpose of this study is to increase $$L/D$$ L / D value as well as to reduce the sonic boom strength by designing the lower side of the waverider configuration. The effect of the concave shape added on the bottom side of the body is examined in this study. The numerical simulation approaches are used to evaluate the objective performance functions of $$L/D$$ L / D and sonic boom strength. As a result, the effect of the concave shape added on the lower surface of the body influences the sonic boom strength. Various types of concave models are examined and important design knowledge for the waverider configuration is extracted. Strong shock waves on the lower side of the body cause high-pressure regions to generate higher lift force, and its efficiency depends on the concave position and/or size.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-05509-6_25,en,Segmentation Based on Image Analysis of Concrete,OriginalPaper,"Most constitutive relations that are used to capture the mechanical response of concrete are based on the assumption that concrete is homogeneous. However, it is a well-known fact that concrete has three distinct regions, namely - aggregate, mortar and Interface Transition Zone (ITZ). One of the reasons for assuming that concrete is a homogeneous material is to simplify the problem for finite element analysis (FEA). The damage behaviour of concrete depends upon the interaction of these three regions. Hence it is necessary to have a clear demarcation of the three regions for discretization and further analysis. It is well known that damage is initiated in the ITZ, which is a weak, porous and heterogeneous region of cement paste around aggregates whose thickness ranges from 9–50 µm. Due to the vast scale difference in the ITZ with aggregate, the ITZ of concrete cross-section is either computer-generated or manually inserted. While generated images are very limited by the algorithms/procedures employed, manual insertion of ITZs on real images takes time and is prone to certain uncertainties. An algorithm that processes the images of concrete for more reliable identification of the location of the ITZ and provides control on its thickness, colour and the minimum size of the aggregates to be included can drastically reduce human-induced error and enable faster and more reliable processing of existing images. In this work, an image processing algorithm is developed using OpenCV and NumPy, which are open source libraries in Python. The concrete image is processed by multiple means like log transformation, erosion, dilation, bilateral filtering and adaptive gaussian thresholding, which significantly improve the identification of different regions in concrete which further enhances appropriate FEM meshing. A contour feature extraction tool called canny edge detection is used to identify the aggregate and to draw the ITZ. The damage predicted through the FEM analysis of the problem domain that is processed by the proposed algorithms is validated by comparing it with the experimentally obtained damage patterns. The proposed algorithm performs better on computer-generated images than the images of actual concrete cross-sections. The accuracy of this algorithm on computer-generated images is over 75%, and it achieves over 90% accuracy on real images. The resulting image is also comparable to images that are computer programmed to have ITZs. Our algorithm enhances the accuracy of FEM analysis of images through the inclusion of ITZ and enhancement of the features of the image.","['Materials Science', 'Structural Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

It seems inevitable that driverless and human-driven vehicles will coexist. The difficulties in building new AV roads will be overcome by the coexistence of traffic, and this method builds on already-existing road infrastructure. Attempts to combine human and autonomous-driven cars have raised a crucial issue in road traffic management: What effects can be expected when a certain number of autonomous vehicles coexist peacefully with human-driven vehicles in terms of efficiency and safety? Two-dimensional (2D) lateral and longitudinal vehicle behavior defines traffic coexistence. It is adapted and improved upon the car-following model idea to effectively depict a mixed traffic system. For secure, slick, and effective mixed-traffic management, the “Cell Reservation-based Intersection Control Management Strategy” is suggested. The key contributions of this research include a guide to mixed traffic integration pattern, an extension of the existing 1-dimensional homogeneous car-following model strategies to a 2-dimensional heterogeneous traffic system, an improvement in human-driven vehicle performance when autonomous vehicle inter-vehicle distance is adjusted, and a method for harmonising speed in mixed traffic. A physics agent traffic simulator is created and used to test three traffic management strategies, including the traffic light method, the collision avoidance with safe distance method, and this proposed method, in order to determine the benefits of the cell reservation traffic control strategy.

Despite the solid motivation behind DOFS-based SHM systems, their implementation for real-time structural assessment is still unsatisfactory outside academia. One of the main reasons is the lack of rigorous methodologies for uncertainty quantification, which hinders the performance assessment of the monitoring system. The concept of Probability of Detection (POD) should function as the guiding light in this process, but precautions must be taken to apply this concept to SHM, as it has been originally developed for Non-Destructive Evaluation techniques. Although DOFS have been the object of numerous studies, a well-established methodology for their performance evaluation in terms of PODs is still missing. In the present work, the concept of Probability of Delamination Detection (POD 2 ) is proposed for a DOFS network; Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) Double-Cantilever Beam (DCB) specimens equipped with DOFS have been tested under static loading, and the strain patterns along with the relative observed delamination size have been collected to generate an adequate database for the POD analysis, suggesting a reference methodology to quantify the performance of DOFS for delamination detection.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

It is known that the arch profiles of bistable arches in their two force-free equilibrium states are related to each other through a bilateral relationship. The closed-form analytical form of the bilateral relationship helps in designing the as-fabricated profile of the bistable arches when their toggled shape is completely specified. However, in certain cases, the arch profiles cannot be designed solely using the bilateral relationship. In this paper, we address such cases and present a design method to obtain arch-profiles using shape optimization in conjunction with the bilateral relationship. Such cases include: (1) arch-profiles that are partially specified in the first or/and second states; (2) arch-profiles that extremise the travel have a prescribed change in slope and have a specific ratio of travel between stable and unstable states. Towards this, the arch-profiles are represented using a set of finite variables corresponding to the mode weights of the basis set in which their shape is described. We formulate the optimization problem for each design case with the constraint to restrict the solutions in design space where the arches are bistable. After describing the procedure for numerically solving the optimization problem, design of arch-profiles using this method is illustrated through examples.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics']"

Among various damage detection techniques those that identify the damage based on changes in the natural frequencies of the system are widely adopted. Detection of the damage location and its severity based on the observed frequency change, however, is an inverse problem where usually a search algorithm and a model update procedure are required to match the output of a damaged model with the observations. Capturing small damage requires analysis at higher frequencies. Wavelengths get shorter at higher frequencies therefore; the standard finite element simulation of wave propagation phenomena requires a high resolution of the discretization. Using standard finite element approaches, this may rapidly exceed the available computer resources, rendering the numerical simulations unfeasible. To avoid limitations of FEM in numerical modelling, the spectral element method has been adopted by many researchers as a viable option, in which the element shape functions are built based on the frequency content considered in the analysis. In the present work, the spectral element approach is adopted in the context of damaged elastic beam analysis to minimize the size of the model in spatial discretization of the damaged beam. The Wittrick-Willams procedure has been implemented to identify the natural frequencies from the frequency- dependent dynamic stiffness matrix of the system. Numerical cost of each step of the spectral analysis is illustrated. The genetic algorithm has been used for the search of the damaged case and the frequency range for a successful outcome is illustrated.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

Glazing element is considered as a constant thickness non-closed cylindrical laminated shell when exposed to interlayer film heat sources. The number of layers and their layout and physical properties are arbitrary. Convective heat exchange occurs on the shell surfaces. The temperature influences have been obtained by solving the nonstationary heat conduction problem. Deformation of the shells is considered on the basis of the refined theory of the first-order accounting transverse shear strains in each layer. The problem solution is built in analytical form by the embedding method. According to the method, the complex-shape shell is virtually embedded within an auxiliary enveloping laminated cylindrical non-closed simply supported shell of rectangular planform shape with the same composition of layers. An auxiliary shell is one whose contour shape and boundary conditions yield a simple analytical solution. The thermal stresses in five-layer aircraft elements have been investigated. The results were validated by comparison with test data. The method suggested can be used for designing heating systems and determining temperature stresses in the laminated glazing of different transport vehicles.","['Engineering', 'Mechatronics', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computational Intelligence']"

The fast-paced development of cheaper but reliable devices has allowed to collect a huge amount of data to deepen the knowledge of the structural behavior over time of existing structures under service conditions. This paper shows the use of MEMS sensors, both clinometers and accelerometers, for continuous structural health monitoring on concrete bridges. A dense sensing monitoring approach is applied, and data are analyzed and compared in near-real time with a threshold set based on an updated reference FE model of the bridges. A case study is presented, where anomaly detection algorithms based on key performance indicator evolution in time have efficiently identified and localized damages triggering repeated proactive maintenance interventions. Attention is given to the seasonal influence on both the static and dynamic response of the bridges, and on the misleading effects on the damage detection and diagnostics processes. This approach is part of a wider framework aimed at an industrial application of SHM, in which the specific aspects covered in this paper have been identified and analyzed on multiple similar concrete bridges under continuous monitoring, of which evidence is provided.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The increased use of connected medical devices makes such an ecosystem more vulnerable and increases the cyber-attack surface. Traditional security methods are insufficient to deal with such a high degree of interconnected medical and IoT devices. There is a need for security approaches based on concepts of collaboration, cooperation, autonomy and dynamism to ensure timely security of the whole healthcare ecosystem. This work adopts swarm-based principles with multi-agent systems to meet collaboration, distribution and robustness requirements, thus improving the healthcare ecosystem’s security. The paper presents a swarm-based agent-to-agent communication model founded on the collaboration among primary and supervisor agents to acquire new knowledge related to the healthcare ecosystem. The proposed model is based on the direct collaboration between primary agents that provides supervisor agents with local security-related information and the indirect collaboration between supervisor agents that exchange stigmergic information through the environment to make a collectively informed decision. The communication model is implemented using the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) approach. The preliminary results show the communication model’s robustness, scalability and responsiveness for securing the healthcare ecosystem.","['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-04094-8_9,en,Quantification of Bias Errors Influence in Frequency Based Substructuring Using Sensitivity Analysis,OriginalPaper,"The methodology to divide complex systems into several subsystems is a common practice in the field of structural dynamics. Structural dynamic analyses can be carried out more efficiently if subsystems are analysed separately and later coupled using dynamic substructuring techniques. However a reliable experimental application of frequency based substructuring (FBS) remains a challenge as it requires highly accurate acquisition of subsystems’ frequency response functions (FRFs). Even a small error from the measurement campaign can yield erroneous coupling results. The measurement errors can be either random or systematic, with the latter often referred to as bias. Impact excitation is popular in dynamic substructuring due to the fast FRF calculation for each impact location. However, deviations in the location of excitation as a typical example of measurement bias affect the FRFs throughout the whole frequency range. This paper proposes a novel methodology to characterize bias errors in FBS based on the small deviations in impact excitation from typical experimental measurements. The deviations are utilized to reconstruct a range of bias-affected FRFs. These are then used in the global sensitivity analysis in order to characterize how each impact location affects an arbitrary quality indicator, such as FRFs reciprocity or passivity. Therefore, the effect of bias can be evaluated directly from a single measurement campaign, without the need for a numerical model. The proposed approach is shown on a synthetic numerical example, where the advantages and limitations are outlined. Virtual point transformation is applied to obtain admittance matrix at the substructures’ interfaces. Hence, virtual point reciprocity is proposed as a criterion to quantify bias error influence. Finally, an application of frequency based substructuring on beam-like structure is depicted.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Civil Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

The spectral CT imaging, especially photon-counting multi-energy spectral CT imaging, can effectively improve the reconstructed image quality and has the distinctive ability of material decomposition and identification, which has important theoretical and application value in the fields of medical diagnosis, non-destructive testing and security inspection, etc. However, the presence of non-ideal effects in spectral CT imaging systems limits the accuracy of basis images. To achieve high accuracy of material decomposition and high quality of basis images, a novel and robust direct iterative basis material image reconstruction method based on maximum a posteriori expectation–maximization algorithm (MAP-EM-DD) is proposed. Furthermore, by incorporating polar coordinate transformation into MAP-EM-DD, MAP-EM-PT-DD method is proposed. The iterative formulas of MAP-EM-DD and MAP-EM-PT-DD methods are derived. To evaluate the proposed methods, a simulated cylinder phantom with inserts that contain polyethylene, hydroxyapatite, salt water, air, and aluminum is established. The proposed methods are quantitatively evaluated for comparative studies. Simulated experimental results show that the proposed methods can remarkably reduce the noise of basis images and error of material decomposition and improve the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of each material-specific region. Compared with the image domain material decomposition based on FBP algorithm (FBP-IDD), MAP-EM-DD method can reduce the noise levels of basis images up to 63.6% and the error levels of each material-specific region up to 62.1%. Simultaneously, the CNRs of each material-specific region are improved up to 237.3%. Compared with MAP-EM-DD method, MAP-EM-PT-DD method can reduce the noise levels of basis images up to 23.6%, the error levels of each material-specific region up to 36.3%, and the reconstruction time of basis images by 14.1%.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Microwaves, RF and Optical Engineering']"

Lubrication oil properties are being monitored periodically to ensure the quality of the oil is always good. Currently, oil change activity is conducted in time-based manner based on engine manufacturer recommendation. Therefore, lubrication oil will be discarded even though it is still useful. The idea of this paper is to consider multiple variables to assess the quality of lubrication oil as a higher number of variables are expected to give a more accurate prediction. In this study, multiple regression and artificial neural network (ANN) model were compared by assessing the R squared value and prediction error when predicting lubrication oil age. Spearman’s correlation was applied to the lubrication oil analysis data to assess the relationship between lubrication oil age with oil analysis parameters and identify the parameters that are highly correlated with oil age. Total base number (TBN), oxidation, iron (Fe), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) were identified as parameters that were strongly correlated with oil age. Multiple regression and ANN were applied to predict the oil age using these parameters as the predictor variables. Both models were compared based on its R squared value and prediction error namely mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute deviation (MAD). Multiple regression presented a better prediction accuracy with higher R squared value of 0.9249 and lower prediction error. However, the P value for the model were more than 0.05 which may be due to the multicollinearity that exist between the independent variables. The R squared value for ANN is considerably high with value of 0.758, which proved its ability to predict the desired oil age.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks', 'Energy Storage']"

The optimal diagram was presented according to the criterion of the maximum speed for the lifting mechanism. Also, the optimal movement diagram was presented under restrictions on the loss number of the lifting mechanism components. A generalized structural diagram has been synthesized, which makes it possible to analyze nonlinear oscillatory lift systems, as objects of regulation, with arbitrary parameters of the lifting mechanisms and arbitrary laws of their control. Recommendations are proposed for improving the quality of the dynamic modes of lifting mechanisms due to vibration damping. The solution of minimizing the vertical vibrations of the elements of lifting mechanisms arising in dynamic modes by forming the required mechanical characteristics of the engine with specific rigidity parameters is considered. Dependencies of the damping coefficient of the equivalent vibrational link on the rigidity of the mechanical characteristics, the recommended values of the rigidity of the mechanical characteristics on the values of the mass ratio, and the maximum value of the damping coefficient on the mass ratio are given.

However, the methods to create the test geometry, which typically require arduous hand measurements and approximations of rotation matrices, are crude. This leads to a lengthy test set-up process and a test geometry with potentially high measurement errors. Test and analysis delays can also be experienced if the orientation of an accelerometer is documented incorrectly, which happens more often than engineers would like to admit. To mitigate these issues, a methodology has been created to generate the test geometry (coordinates and rotation matrices) with probe data from a portable coordinate measurement machine (PCMM). This methodology has led to significant reductions in the test geometry measurement time, reductions in test geometry measurement errors, and even reduced test times. Simultaneously, a methodology has also been created to use the PCMM to easily identify desired measurement locations, as specified by a model.

The main motivation behind using deep learning methods for community detection comes from the brilliant performance results shown by deep neural networks in various fields. Using unsupervised learning models, the problem of community detection can be solved. The high-dimensional feature space representation of the network data leads to a complex neural network architecture that requires a high number of trainable parameters. Deep learning-based models can transform the high-dimensional graph data of complex networks into simple, low-dimensional space or latent representation. The transformation of network representation to latent representation consists of meaningful features of the network data. This mapping preserves the structural information of the network later on, which clustering algorithms can be applied to the converted latent representation. This survey paper provides an overview of the traditional and deep learning-based methods of community detection, followed by a discussion on the challenges and future directions of community detection.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This trend is visible in the changing age structure of the population as the proportion of older people is growing while the proportion of working-age people is reducing. The demographic changes in the EU result in the decreasing percentage of working-age people and the increasing relative number of pensioners. The coming decades will see a significant rise in older adult numbers in the total population. The increasing life expectancy and ageing are putting a strain on the economy while also demanding to improve society’s well-being, meet the needs of older people and make use of their potential and abilities. Older adults require support in the form of care, especially in the case of a low independence level. One technology that can significantly improve the quality of life of older people is humanoid robot (for example the Rudy Robot). This paper aims to analyse and evaluate this technology in terms of different groups of criteria: competitiveness, demand, technical, social and ethical, ecological, and ease of use. These criteria were initially identified and then examined to see which of them the respondents thought were the most important. According to the respondents the most important criteria are demand and technical aspects. Therefore, the article analyses the Rudy Robot in more detail in terms of these two groups of criteria. It was also checked whether age, gender of the respondent, place of residence and education had an impact on the assessment the Rudy Robot. The survey was conducted in Poland at the turn of 2020 and 2021 with people over 40 years of age. The representative research sample consisted of 1152 respondents (all respondents were Polish citizens from all voivodships). This type of research has not been conducted in Poland so far.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This paper centers on image restoration in remote sensing quick-view systems. Through calculating the two-level screw target matching image, the ratio of power spectrum density could be estimated quickly. Then Wiener filtering method is implemented to restore blurred images. To restrain the ringing artifact in quick-view system, different weights are introduced on the edge of the target when implementing Wiener filter.

Common data models are an immanent feature of systems engineering applications that can be used to reduce the number of interconnections between software modules. Using common open-source data structures in airship design helps engineers in evaluating and visualizing early designs using several methods.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-14623-7_28,en,Method of Assessing the Pressure Generated by the Water Packer Saturated Packer,OriginalPaper,"For today, the simplest and most reliable way to isolate geological beds when pumping wells is to use packers, which are elastomers capable of increasing in volume when in contact with certain formation fluids. The most significant indicator for the elastomers used in packers is the degree of their swelling, which provides layer isolation during construction and operation of wells. In this case, considerable pressure is applied on the wall of the tubing string, which can lead to its deformation. The purpose of this work is to create a method for determining the stresses caused by swelling of the packer for further assessment of the possibility of deformations in the tubing string. This article describes design of the device, which is used to assess the amount of deformation of the momentless shells caused by swelling of the elastomer samples used in the production of packers. The magnitude of the shell displacements was used to estimate the pressure that caused these displacements. In this case, the equations of the theory of momentless shells were used. It was assumed that the working conditions of the elastomer created by the device correspond to the working conditions of the packer, when its deformations along the pipe axis are almost absent, and the greatest radial pressure on the pipe occurs. An important condition is the choice of the shell material, for which a grid with a mesh size of 0.056 mm was proposed. The choice of such a material, on the one hand, is due to the need for unhindered access of water to the elastomer samples, and on the other hand, the need to exclude the possibility of blocking the cells as a result of its swelling. Obtained pressure values can be used for choosing one or another type of elastomer for the packer, taking into account the geometric parameters and mechanical properties of the tubing string.","['Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Regional/Spatial Science']"

Social distancing interventions for Covid-19 have changed the way people communicate. People used to meet at cafes, streets, and other places, and these socialising occasions seemed luxurious due to social separation. Thus, the demand for online matchmaking has increased inevitably. Matchmaking apps in the market commonly use collaborative filtering (CF) that recommends matches based on user ratings or preferences. As a result, users are overloaded with match choices. In addition, CF has a cold-start issue. Thus, we aim to find a performing hybrid recommendation model that can overcome CF’s weakness. In this study, we built two recommendation models for matchmaking: (i) content-based filtering + distance similarity + collaborative filtering (CBF+DS+CF), (ii) content-based filtering + demographic-based filtering + collaborative filtering (CBF+DF+CF). We then compared them with (iii) collaborative filtering (CF). These three models perform matching calculations and recommendations based on user’s profile data and latent preferences, i.e., likes, dislikes, and profile searching. We implemented these three models in a mobile application and conducted a usability test. CBF+DF+CF is found to be the best recommendation model for matchmaking.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In some cases (for example, in case of the COVID-19 disease), the phenomenon has several waves, which needs to apply multilogistic (multiwave logistic) curves in order to perform realistic investigation. In product design, the logistic curve can describe the lifecycle of a product. A product lifecycle can be finished by the significant decrease of the market, but in some cases, several new developments and innovations can regenerate the increase of the market by starting a new boom. This renewing process can invoke several waves of the phenomenon, which will make necessary the application of multilogistic curves for the correct study. This multiwave behaviour of the product lifecycle makes this phenomenon very similar to the time history of the COVID-19 disease which also has several waves, because of the newer and newer virus variants. Analysis and comparison of several phenomena described by logistic curves, or bi- logistic, tri- logistic or multilogistic curves can be made easier by the application of the EBSYQ (Evolutionary Based SYstem of Qualification and comparison of group achievements) comparison and qualification system. The similarity between the multiwave characteristics of the product lifecycle and coronavirus time history makes possible to apply several results, skills and methods of comparison and investigation, which were developed and used previously during the analysis of several waves of the disease also for the case of product lifecycle analysis.","['Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering']"

This implies a great demand for a highly efficient model order reduction technique to not only reduce the computational effort but, more importantly, provide reliable displacement predictions on certain degrees of freedom (shrouds). The latter becomes more critical in bladed disks with shroud contacts, since the promising results from contact models are limited by the accuracy of displacements predicted by reduced-order models for shroud degrees of freedom. In this study, some notable reduction of order methodologies based on substructuring, namely, fixed interface (Craig-Bampton), free interface (Rubin), and dual Craig-Bampton, and the mixed interface method, which is a combination of free and fixed interface methods, are investigated. The center of attention in this work is the modal contributions of components to the final result and the influence of modal characteristics of substructures on the efficiency of a particular reduction technique. To this end, the methods are examined by a different number of retained modes. The effect of adding up more vibration modes to the reduction basis on the accuracy and computational cost for each reduction technique is compared for predefined error tolerance. It is concluded that the physical characteristics of the blade and disk components significantly affect the forced response of the bladed disk system. Consequently, it can be capitalized on to find a more effective reduction technique for the specific geometry of shrouded blisks to address high computational cost and accurate forced response required in specific areas.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Civil Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

We suggest how non-profits could re-use data they already generate, along with open public data, to address their data challenges and gaps, including to evidence their social impact. Second, we explain why non-profits should aim for data capability that differs in relation to context, comparing it with data literacy and data maturity as outcomes. We propose benefits from collaborating with data and data analytics because it enables access to wider resources and more holistic solutions. We end by summarising the current relationship between citizens who are often in non-profit data as clients and customers and the lack of routine ways for non-profits to engage citizens in data work. We highlight this space of working with citizens as one where experiments and new ideas are forming. We suggest non-profits need to invest in skilling-up and resourcing within their organisations, so they are competent to work with citizens and data.","['Social Sciences', 'Social Policy', 'Politics of the Welfare State', 'Social Work and Community Development', 'Comparative Social Policy', 'Sociology, general', 'Public Policy']"

By varying submerged depth ( h/D ) and roller rotation ( ω rad/s), we demonstrated the different changes in interfacial structures due to cusp-induced air entrainment. Deviation in the cusp-shaped entrained thickness ( H ) and length of air filament (angular position (θ)) due to numerous submerged depth, roller rotations and effect of capillary number on various submerged depth has been explained thoroughly in this present investigation. The effect of viscosity, surface tension, gravitational force and rotational inertia on the entrainment pattern is also a subject of this present investigation.

An Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) Approach,OriginalPaper,"In developing countries like India, mostly barrier toll plazas are present, where the approaching vehicle driver has to choose a particular toll lane for the transaction, whether it is a Manual Toll Collection (MTC) or Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) system. Further, mixed traffic conditions prevail on the roadways in developing nations, and the same has been observed at the toll lanes. Dedicated lanes are present for different vehicle classes at toll plazas for a seamless transaction. The approaching vehicle driver chooses the lane, which causes the minimum delay to him/her and thus causes mixed traffic conditions at toll plazas, i.e., the presence of different vehicle classes in the dedicated lanes. Due to these mixed traffic conditions, the operations at toll plazas get hampered, leading to bottleneck formation, causing delays to users. Hence, it is necessary to monitor the lane choice behavior of the drivers’ at toll plazas to minimize his/her own delay. The present study evaluates the factors affecting the lane choice behavior using the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and thus computes the most affecting factor for lane choice behavior at toll plazas under mixed traffic conditions. The factors are modeled using the user perception data collected in the pairwise comparison matrix as per the AHP scale. The factors considered for the present study are queue length, lane changes, Proportion of heavy vehicles, Proportion of trailers, and approach lane. It is also found that the queue length affects lane choice the most, carrying a weight of 0.32, followed by Proportion of HCV (0.28), while the lane changes (0.09) were the least affecting factor. These factors are helpful to monitor the traffic at the toll plaza to avoid the situation of congestion. Further, the AHP weights can be used with any Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method to form an algorithm of lane choice for connected autonomous vehicles.","['Engineering', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

As an example, the calculation, based on deformations and deflection of flexible threads reinforcing honeycombs, of the rotational speed of honey extractor rotor with honeycomb frames, was made by the developed computer program. The introduced and refined correction factors of the initial mass of the product compensate for the deformation resistance of the honeycomb. In the process of research, the calculated value of the degree of filling of honeycomb products was established—0.131. The regression expression of the magnitude of the deflection of the threads on the rotor speed was revealed. The dependence of the effective rotor speed of the honey extractor rotor on the radius of the circumscribed circle of the placement of the frames was established.

This work establishes a software-defined networking (SDN) based architecture for edge/cloud computing services in 5G heterogeneous networks (HetNets), which can support efficient and on-demand computing resource management to optimize resource utilization and satisfy the time-varying computational tasks uploaded by user devices. In addition, resulting from the information incompleteness, we design an evolutionary game based service selection for users, which can model the replicator dynamics of service subscription. Based on this dynamic access model, a Stackelberg differential game based cloud computing resource sharing mechanism is proposed to facilitate the resource trading between the cloud computing service provider (CCP) and different edge computing service providers (ECPs). Then we derive the optimal pricing and allocation strategies of cloud computing resource based on the replicator dynamics of users’ service selection. These strategies can promise the maximum integral utilities to all computing service providers (CPs), meanwhile the user distribution can reach the evolutionary stable state at this Stackelberg equilibrium. Furthermore, simulation results validate the performance of the designed resource sharing mechanism, and reveal the convergence and equilibrium states of user selection, and computing resource pricing and allocation.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication']"

However, due to cross-axial responses in single-axis, the net response of multiple single-axis vibration tests results in an overestimation of the severity of the service environment. In practice, over-testing has been a result of the limitations associated with physical experimentation, which indicates a need to improve simulation methods and accuracy of current lifetime test strategies. In this chapter, single- and multi-axis experimental vibration tests of the Box Assembly with Removable Component (BARC) model are simulated with implicit and explicit methods using the commercial FEA tool ABAQUS, where the multiple observed outputs are vibrational responses in the three translational degrees of freedom. The model looks to validate physically obtained experimental data by replicating certain boundary conditions and service environments.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Complexity', 'Materials Science, general', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation']"

Finding new and effective technologies can help all the farmers yield good quality crops with better profits across all categories of crops. In this paper, a BiCropRec framework for crop recommendation has been proposed which integrates latent semantic indexing for topic modelling. The BiCropRec model is knowledge centric and uses two distinct classifiers in order to increase the heterogeneity of classification. The model integrates upper domain ontologies and a knowledge graph and uses several semantic similarity computation schemes to yield best in class recommendation maintaining a high diversity index. Experimentations have indicated that the proposed BiCropRec framework has yielded much higher performance measures when compared to the baseline models. BiCropRec has furnished an overall F-measure of 97.66% with a very low false discovery rate of 0.03.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-21203-1_22,en,Learning to Classify Logical Formulas Based on Their Semantic Similarity,OriginalPaper,"An important task in logic, given a formula and a knowledge base which represents what an agent knows of the current state of the world, is to be able to guess the truth value of the formula. Logic reasoners are designed to perform inferences, that is, to decide whether a formula is a logical consequence of the knowledge base, which is stronger than that and can be intractable in some cases. In addition, under the open-world assumption, it may turn out impossible to infer a formula or its negation. In many practical situations, however, when an agent has to make a decision, it is acceptable to resort to heuristic methods to determine the probable veracity or falsehood of a formula, even in the absence of a guarantee of correctness, to avoid blocking the decision-making process and move forward. This is why we propose a method to train a classification model based on available knowledge in order to be able of accurately guessing whether an arbitrary, unseen formula is true or false. Our method exploits a kernel representation of logical formulas based on a model-theoretic measure of semantic similarity. The results of experiments show that the proposed method is highly effective and accurate.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In this study, a coupled finite difference–discrete model was adopted with which to analyze the shear behavior of a sand–smooth geomembrane interface. The model was validated using experimental data. The numerical results show that the effects of normal stress and surface hardness on the interface strength depend on the shear mechanism (sliding or plowing) at the interface. There exists a critical normal stress at which the mechanism transforms from predominant sliding to predominant plowing. There is a high level of coupling effect between normal stress and surface hardness on the interface strength. Micro–topographical analysis of geomembrane provides clear insights into the shear mechanism at the interface, supporting the results obtained from interface shear tests. No shear band is formed during shearing for a sand–smooth geomembrane interface. The shear resistance of sand–smooth geomembrane interface relies on interface indentations and characteristics rather than on the formation of a shear band.","['Engineering', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Civil Engineering']"

The sybil node impersonates like an authenticated user by bogusly generating node identity and sends the false/biased data to wireless sensor nodes and gateway nodes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a security mechanism that uses outlier detection and trust estimation to detect the false/biased data generated by the sybil attack. Outlier detection is performed over the estimated trust and sensed data to detect the node outliers and data outliers which in turn used to detect the sybil attack and the false data injected by it. Further to it, triangle inequality between the nodes based on the geographical position of the nodes is used to detect the sybil attacks in the Wireless Sensor Network. Based on the node outlier detection and data outlier, sybil attack and false data injected by it in the network is identified and removed. The proposed security mechanism is experimented in a Wireless Sensor Network using ZigBee nodules and Raspberry Pi. Based on the empirical analysis, the median based outlier detection performs well than the hampel identifier and z-score. So, in the proposed system, the median based outlier detection method was used to detect the node outliers and data outliers. The experimental results show that the proposed method detects the sybil attack with more than 90% of detection rate and prevents the attack consequences from the decision making in the gateway node.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Proper scheduling ensures ‘When’ a particular activity is carried out, while the routing guarantees ‘Where’ is the activity executed. This paper emphasizes the collective use and elaboration of computational techniques for optimum scheduling and routing of material flow in an industrial environment achieved by amalgamating traditional techniques and methodologies with modern computational solutions. This computational piece of program deployed in and for the industry is programmed in python language along with further post computation enhancement that is done using Project Libre’s .xml file support. The program computes the minimum possible production time for given inputs subjected to constraints applicable and also the most optimum route for smooth material flow throughout the floor. A user-friendly U.I. has been developed along with further analysis aided by modifying the .xml file to provide the Gantt chart for floor level reference. A substantial increment in production activity was observed which also led to the establishment of an autonomous system for scheduling and routing.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Machinery and Machine Elements']"

The motivation is to characterize the projectile-target interaction at early time scales, which includes both the target and projectile response. Prior work has focused on demonstrating the utility of in situ diagnostic techniques for investigating the physics of failure of high-strength metallic and ceramic targets; however, less work has been done to experimentally quantify the projectile deformation. Digital image correlation has been identified as a promising technique to provide real-time, full-field characterization of the dynamic failure behavior during ballistic impact. In instances where the material response is multiaxial, DIC provides one of the only practical means of collecting full-field 3D data. Stereo DIC involves applying a speckle pattern to the target surface and tracking the deformation using two synchronized cameras. This allowed for the 3D reconstruction of deformation histories. The focus of the current study is to understand the limitations and uncertainty of ultra-high-speed DIC for measuring high-rate deformation. Copper long rods were launched into ceramic anvils at a range of velocities (250-500 m/s) to characterize the axial strain and strain rate. A methodology is presented for implementing ultra-high-speed DIC in addition to concurrent multiflash X-ray imaging.","['Materials Science', 'Materials Science, general', 'Biomaterials', 'Structural Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

It functions as a heat pump moving heat from one side of the device to the other. The growing adoption of electric vehicles, growing inclination toward renewable energy sources, and increase in demand for energy-efficient consumer electronics are the key factors driving the thermoelectric devices market. However, the high cost of thermoelectric modules, design complexity and heat dissipation issues restrain the market growth. The reduced size of the thermoelectric elements is one goal for TEC module manufacturers. Various benefits can be achieved if TEC is made lighter and smaller. When the size of a TEC is reduced, however, we run into issues with heat transfer. It is difficult to transfer heat (source to sink) when end plates are small in cross-section. Increasing the gap between the TE elements would almost certainly solve the issue. But conduction, convection, and radiation heat losses increase substantially. In recent years, new techniques to design thermoelectric coolers have made significant progress. We summarize recent progress in the design of sustainable thermoelectric cooling devices in this review, which have been established to enhance various performance requirements and add new functionality.","['Energy', 'Energy Systems', 'Renewable and Green Energy', 'Materials Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

It was found that the STL of the carpet with direct foaming process is much worse than the separate foaming process carpet when the boundary condition was Bonded-Bonded. Then a full vehicle SEA model was developed to predict the sound pressure level (SPL) at the front-left (FL) driver’s headspace. In parallel, a test was conducted to measure the SPL response at the same space after the floor was assembled on the vehicle.

The feats of human creativity and innovation provide our conspecifics too much to marvel at and feel proud of what human civilization has achieved in the course of its evolution down the ages. However, despite all our technological sophistications, we have failed to achieve this glory without compromising the ecological balance of nature. The ecological fallout of anthropogenic activities makes us ponder over the drawbacks inherent in man-made technologies. From this perspective, insects emerge as serious competitors to man because their intriguing evolutionary history is a unique success story which saw their domination in all habitats and resulted in their unprecedented diversity without disturbing the environment and its delicate balance. This is such a remarkable thing that tempts us to learn a lot from insects and come up with novel, environment-friendly, and more efficient technologies. Many branches of life sciences such as genetics, molecular biology, developmental biology, and chronobiology have benefitted so much from the studies on insects that insect models have become indispensable for their growth. Interestingly, insects have been an inspiration behind many of the technological advancements of our contemporary world.

A comprehensive understanding of the process and subsequent improvement of soil management practices is an important step in developing sustainable agriculture and other land uses. This can not only increase the quality and productivity of arable lands, but also reduce carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere. Currently developed SOC models are characterized by the multitude of considered factors: biological and physical processes, chemical reactions, influence of weather, crop and soil conditions. The importance of subsoil carbon also has been recognized, and a number of layered SOC models emerged. As decomposition of organic matter depends greatly on the soil physical characteristics such as moisture and temperature, these layered carbon models require corresponding estimates to remain consistent. In this study, we take the RothPC-1 layered carbon decomposition model, and supply it with a comprehensive physical soil water and heat flow model. The two models are interconnected in a way that the carbon model uses the estimates of soil moisture and temperature from the moisture model, and the physical soil properties are then modified according to the simulated content of organic matter. The model simulations were conducted for three sites in Ukraine. The experiment covered a period between 2010 and 2020 and involved only data from the open datasets.

This modification was carried out as the conventional 2D-SWD equations often require special treatment when applied to complex braided rivers. The modified model is then applied to two different flow domains of the Brahmaputra river viz. at the braided reach near Umananda Island and reach with a series of spurs dyke near Majuli island. The stability of the model is checked using Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition. The maximum flow depth in the braided reach is observed as 15–18 m, and near the spur dykes, it is found as 35–37 m. Model simulated flow depth and velocity are compared with the field measured data. The model’s computational accuracy near the flow-hydraulic structure interaction zone is evaluated with two different boundary conditions: no slip condition and reflecting boundary condition. Based on root mean square error (RMSE) and Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), the reflection boundary condition shows superior in simulating the velocity profile (RMSE = 0.11, NSE = 0.60) as compared to no slip condition (RMSE = 0.28, NSE = 0.22). These findings suggested that the water surface gradient in the modified 2D-SWD model gives more flexibility for application in the braided river.

This paper introduces the Aligned Marker Space (AMS) method to close this gap and allow using straightforward deflection-difference-based damage detection methods for various civil engineering structures. The method involves transforming vision data into a new morphed space to straighten complex geometries along one dimension. Data transformed using this approach can be used as an input to various damage detection algorithms, including local (e.g., second-derivative-based or wavelet-based algorithms) and global approaches (e.g., trend detection and line-segments method).

But it is difficult to predict the cases when lightning strikes the current-carrying parts of electrical equipment. Therefore, it is necessary to have calculations on the distribution of fields during a lightning strike. This chapter presents models of the electric field in the vicinity of long thin wire rods and a model of the distribution of electric fields in the presence of an ionized streamer zone near the lightning top. The processes of corona at the tops of grounded rods, which imitate protected objects and lightning rods, are analyzed. The physical modeling of electromagnetic processes during the development of the corona on rod electrodes with different vertices has been performed.","['Energy', 'Energy Systems', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Control and Systems Theory']"

A plethora of automated or semi-automated inspection systems have been engineered to enable the robotic manipulation of specific types of sensors. Robotic inspection systems are usually operated through off-line programmed tool-paths. This approach works well when an accurate model of the part is available and the robotic inspection takes place in a well-structured environment, where the part position is precisely registered with respect to the robot reference system. However, it makes the inspection setup for each new part very time-consuming and dependent on the skills and experience of the robot programmer. Moreover, the real geometry of a part may significantly deviate from its digital counterpart, resulting in inaccurate tool paths. This work introduces a new approach capable of conferring full autonomy to robotic sensing applications, providing a breakthrough in the state-of-the-art. As a result of this work, fully autonomous single-pass geometric and volumetric inspection of complex parts, using one single robotized sensor, becomes possible. This concept can find wide applicability to the open problems of structural health monitoring of the modern age.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

As the world health organization adduced, technological proceeds in cardiac function assessment have become the nucleus and heart of all leading research studies on CVDs. Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is the most functional and convenient tool used to test the range of heart-related irregularities. Most of the approaches present in the literature on ECG signal analysis consider noise removal, rhythm-based analysis, and heartbeat detection to improve the performance of a cardiac pacemaker. Advancements in ECG segment detection and beat classification have a limited evaluation and still require clinical approvals.

An efficient HI should satisfy prognostic requirements such as monotonicity, trendability, and prognosability in such a way that it can be effectively used as an input in a prognostic model for remaining useful life estimation. However, discovering or designing a suitable HI for composite structures is a challenging task due to the inherent complexity of the evolution of damage events in such materials. Previous research has shown that data-driven models are efficient for accomplishing this goal. Large labeled datasets, however, are normally required, and the SHM data can only be labeled, respecting prognostic requirements, after a series of nominally identical structures are tested to failure. In this paper, a semi-supervised learning approach based on implicitly imposing prognostic criteria is adopted to design a novel HI suitable. To this end, single-stiffener composite panels were subjected to compression-compression fatigue loading and monitored using acoustic emission (AE). The AE data after signal processing and feature extraction were fused using a multi-layer LSTM neural network with criteria-based hypothetical targets to generate an intelligent HI. The results confirm the performance of the proposed scenario according to the prognostic criteria.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

This health crisis has gotten worse with the new corona virus variant, which transmits even faster leading to critical shortage in hospital care beds and ventilators. To address this shortage, efforts are directed towards the fast construction of HCFs or conversion of non-medical facilities into temporary medical ones. However, there is a lack of structured support systems behind the decisions made. Disaster management has recently been growing in importance. It mainly addresses humanitarian logistics and emergency responses in case of disasters using various methodologies including operation research approaches. However, it did not tackle yet the emergency cases of pandemics and outbreaks. Accordingly, this paper presents the framework for a decision support system (DSS) that would help arrive at the best decision for fast provision HCFs in a timely and cost-effective manner amid health crises. The DSS consists of two modules: (1) first module determines the optimum structural system for fast construction of new HCFs considering the construction cost and duration and the associated life cycle costs, and (2) the second module determines the optimum selection of candidate non-medical facilities that can be converted into temporary HCFs considering multiple attributes. The proposed DSS will help policy makers respond quickly to pandemic crises and confine its disastrous impact on the society.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

Time-domain methods have certain advantages compared to feature-domain methods. For example, statistical analysis may be more reliable, because the data dimensionality is often low and the number of data points large. In addition, the algorithm can be fully automated, because system identification is not necessary. In this paper, autocorrelation functions (ACF) replace the direct response measurements in the time-domain data analysis. ACFs have many advantages compared to the actual time history records. Their accuracy can be controlled by choosing a proper measurement period. Spatiotemporal correlation between the ACFs can be utilized, because they have the same form as a free decay of the system for stationary random processes. This makes it possible to manage with a smaller number of sensors. In the proposed method, a spatiotemporal covariance matrix is estimated using the ACFs of the training data from the undamaged structure under different environmental or operational conditions. Using novelty detection techniques, an extreme value statistics control chart is designed to detect damage. The direction of the largest discrepancy between the training and test data is used to localize damage. A numerical experiment was performed by simulating vibration measurements of a bridge deck under stationary random excitation and variable environmental conditions. The excitation or environmental variables were not measured. Damage was a crack in a steel girder. ACFs outperformed both direct measurement data and virtual sensor data in damage detection. Damage localization was successful in all cases.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Structural Materials', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

However, in real constructions, inclined cracks always take place. Therefore, they should affect the strength of the beams. This influence is greater the greater the width of the opening of these cracks. The type of reinforcement—double-sided or three-sided clamps—also affects the strength. Normally, they are combined into one group. To answer the question about the influence of the type of clamps, prototypes reinforced with these carbon fiber clamps were tested according to a single method. The paper presents the research results of the strength of oblique sections of reinforced concrete beams reinforced with double-sided carbon fiber clamps. The efficiency of composite reinforcement is estimated when the value of the cut span changes, which is equal to 1.5; 2 and 2.5h 0 . At the same time, the degree of influence of the initial cracks on the bearing capacity of the oblique section was analyzed. Recommendations for taking into account the influence of the width of the initial inclined cracks on the strength of beams are proposed.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

Modern fleets often comprise of clusters of similarly deteriorating assets, due to customisation or diversity in their operational settings. As such, the prevalent techniques of using a single fleet-wide model or independent cluster-specific models for modelling the times-to-failures are associated with high bias or high variance respectively. The problem of high variance is especially prominent for the asset clusters with where relatively fewer failures are observed. This paper proposes that statistical hierarchical modelling systematically mitigates the problem of high variance for the clusters with sparse data using shared higher level models for the cluster-specific model parameters. A hierarchical model of the Weibull density functions is shown in this chapter as an example because of the popularity of the Weibull distributions in reliability applications. Failure trajectories from a fleet of simulated turbofans are used herewith for the experiments that compare the advantage of the proposed hierarchical model over independent or fleet-wide models for modelling the observed times-to-failures.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Both passive and active methods of targeting delivery have been proposed, often with particular emphasis on cancer treatment. Passive methods rely on the overexpression of a biomarker in diseased tissue that can then be used to target the therapy. Active techniques involve physically guiding therapeutic agents toward the target region. Since the motion of magnetic particles can be remotely controlled by external magnetic fields, magnetic technologies have the potential to drive and hold drugs or other cargo at the required therapeutic site, increasing the localized dose while minimizing overall exposure. Directed motion may be generated either by simple magnetic attraction or by causing the particles to perform swimming strokes to produce propulsion. This chapter will compare the different strategies using magnetic nanotechnology to produce directed motion compatible with that required for targeted cargo delivery and magnetically assisted therapies and assess their potential to meet the challenges of operating within the human body.","['Life Sciences', 'Biological Techniques', 'Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences/Technology']"

Therefore, we propose a novel and highly secure symmetric-key cryptography, symKrypt for short, to defend against diverse attacks and provide tighter security than the conventional cryptography. Our proposed algorithm uses multiple private keys to encrypt a single block of a message. To generate the private keys, we again propose a true-random number generator, called Grando, and a pseudo-random number generator, called Prando. Moreover, symKrypt keeps secret about the bit mixing of the original message with the private keys. Also, the number of private keys is kept secret. In addition, the private keys are generated dynamically based on the initial inputs using a pseudo-random number generator which is highly unpredictable and secure. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the capabilities of symKrypt and provide experimental demonstration using millions of private keys to prove its correctness. Furthermore, we demonstrate the proposed pseudo-random number generator algorithm experimentally in NIST SP 800-22 statistical test suite. Our propose random number generators, Grando and Rando, pass all 15 tests in the NIST SP 800-22 test suite. To the best of our knowledge, symKrypt is the first model to use multiple private keys in encryption yet lightweight and powerful.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Information Systems and Communication Service', 'Management of Computing and Information Systems']"

The videos captured by a camera are prone to various distortions such as noise, smoke, haze, low or uneven illumination, blur, rain, and compression, which affect visual quality. Automatic identification of distortions is important when enhancing video quality. Video quality assessment involves two stages: (1) classification of distortions affecting the video frames and (2) ranking of these distortions. A novel video dataset was utilized for training, validating, and testing. Working with this dataset was challenging because it included nine categories of distortions and four levels of severity. The greatest challenge was the availability of multiple types of distortions in the same video. The work presented in this paper addresses the problem of multi-label distortion classification and ranking. A vision transformer was used for feature learning. The experiment showed that the proposed solution performed well in terms of F1 score of single distortion (77.9%) and F1 score of single and multiple distortions (69.9%). Moreover, the average accuracy of level classification was 62% with an average F1 score of 61%.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computers and Education', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.

All existing studies of metamaterials assume that the structure is intact and undamaged. However, all real-world structures will eventually experience some damage (e.g., due to manufacturing defects, material inclusions, handling damage, corrosion, etc.). For metamaterials to be placed in service in real applications, an understanding of their behavior in the presence of damage is necessary. This chapter explores two related concepts: structural health monitoring (i.e., damage detection) and damage tolerance (i.e., robust performance in the presence of failures). Central to both concepts is the fact that metamaterial damage creates highly localized modes near the damaged location, which may cause undesirable high local stresses. Damage can be detected by observing the presence of these modes, and damage tolerance can be improved by designing the metamaterial in such a way as to tailor these local modes to mitigate the stress increases.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Solid Construction', 'Complexity', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Structural Materials']"

This is a quite complex mathematical problem and well-known scientific literature usually offers a solution only in graphic or tabular form. One of the main problems is the highly nonlinear dependence of results on supports stiffness at free vibrations and stability loss. In the paper, these difficulties are overcome by approximation of nonlinear dependencies using the least-squares method and getting analytical quadratic approximating functions instead. As a result, we get a closed-form solution for the problem in the form of a fourth-degree resolving equation that has an analytical solution. This solution allows determining support stiffness which provides the first eigenfrequency of a two-support beam and its first critical force. Replacing the strongly nonlinear dependencies with simpler quadratic functions, however, adversely affected the calculation error which can reach 10%. To reduce this error, it is recommended that the stiffness of both supports be equal or of the same order.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Mechatronics']"

The remaining energy of LiB is the very important parameter determined continuously by estimating LiB’s state of charge (SoC). SoC estimation is one of the main functions of the battery management systems (BMS). This article presents the use of two sigma-point Kalman filters (SPKF) to estimate accurately the SoC of the LiB based on the second-order model of the cell. The LiB’s average SoC and the zero bias of the current measurement through the LiB are estimated by the first SPKF, while the second filter is applied to calculate the SoC differences between LiB’s average SoC and the modules’ SoC in the LiB. To improve the SoC accuracy of the LiB modules, a second-order RC equivalent circuit model (SECM) of the cell is used, and the influences of temperature, voltage hysteric, measurement errors, and zero bias of current measurement on the SoC estimation of the LiB are taken into account. To verify the method, the experimental test is conducted in the LiB with cells connected in parallels and series. The simulation and experimental results are analyzed to prove that the SoC estimation of the modules in the LiB is higher accuracy, and the LiB’s average SoC errors are less than 1.5% at different temperatures ranging from − 5 to 45 ℃. The calculation time consuming is shorter, and the calculation complex is reduced significantly.","['Engineering', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security']"

We describe here a new tractography method based on polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PSOCT). PSOCT obtains fiber orientation information by measuring the optic axis of a birefringent sample, similar in conventional polarized light microscopy (PLM). However, PSOCT does not require sample sectioning and can acquire 3D tissue image nondestructively. A Jones calculus-based algorithm is introduced to extract “local” optic axis from the intrinsic “cumulative” PSOCT measurements. A dual-angle imaging approach can be implemented to image the absolute 3D fiber orientation in space. With its high resolution, rapid scanning speed, and depth-resolved imaging, this PSOCT-based tractography provides a promising tool for studying the important function-structure relationship in fibrous tissues.","['Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Biomedical Engineering/Biotechnology', 'Medical and Radiation Physics', 'Diagnostic Radiology']"

The roots of different species stabilize the ground by their tensile strength. However, how the tensile strength is governed by different root and shoot characteristics is less known. In this study, root tensile strength was investigated, and root and shoot characteristics were simultaneously measured. An experimental relationship between the root tensile strength and root diameter was developed. First, feature selection methods were applied to identify the critical characteristics affecting root tensile strength. Furthermore, the machine learning (ML) models were developed using individual methods (Sequential Minimal Optimization Regression (SMOreg), Instance-based Learning (IBk), Random Forest (RF), Linear Regression (LR), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)) and ensemble methods (ensemble via MLP and LR models). Results showed that the ensemble via the MLP outperformed all other individual models as well as the ensemble via the LR. The root mean square error of the ensemble via MLP was 3 times better compared to the experimental model based upon a power relationship between root tensile strength and the root diameter. The need for studying the complexity in relationships of various attributes of vegetation using ML models is discussed.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Statistics, general']"

Indeed, detecting rotor imbalances in wind turbines starts by first isolating and then assessing the energy of the 1P harmonic, leading to a feature that is efficient but not failure mode agnostic. While different engineered features can be used concurrently, some anomalies in the acceleration signal might remain undetected by the algorithm, even though they are visually noticeable to a human in the signal’s spectrogram. Thus, this project aims to build an AI algorithm capable of detecting anomalies in spectrograms, agnostic of their origin, providing an early warning for potential structural issues. The proposed algorithm infers spectrograms of acceleration signals through a deep autoencoder. Anomalies are identified based on a custom reconstruction error. A sensitivity analysis is performed for two types of anomaly, in which waveforms with different energy levels are artificially added to an acceleration signal measured from an offshore wind turbine (OWT). For a 1P harmonic anomaly representing 20% of the total signal energy, the proposed approach yielded an efficiency (AUC) equal to 96% thanks to a novel reconstruction error, which significantly increased the performances.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

Further, an attention mechanism is used to determine which features are most relevant for classification.

Solving the differential equations, based on the Euler method, makes it possible to illustrate the movement curves: displacement, speed, and acceleration. The used model is based on a bibliographical study and specifically on the existing vibrational models of bolted assemblies. Several analytical models are reviewed, to propose a discrete model with two degrees of freedom, for a one bolt assembly, with bolting stress, and excited longitudinally by a transient force. The model was found capable of predicting the dynamic responses of the two assembled parts. The description of the contact interface by a cubic stiffness allowed realistic responses, to conclude that the retained model is accurate.

In this work, Single Minute Exchange of Die (popularly known as SMED) is adopted as one of the lean tools to overcome the difficulty. Efforts are made to implement SMED in a small-scale industry of a nonwoven fabric bag manufacturing company. Nonwoven fabric bags are an alternative to single-use plastic carry bags. Being alternate to single-use plastic bags these bags drags a lot of market demand and faster delivery. A wide range of nonwoven carry bags find wide application in varied industries for packaging purposes and also is used in mall culture. Manufacturing of Nonwoven carry bags comes in different patterns, different sizes, and different colors. Customers ask for a large variety of bags with smaller lots, which is the biggest challenge for the industry to manufacture smaller lots having more variety of bags. Because of the longer changeover times the industries are manufacturing bigger lots with the least variety of bags, which in turn creates a problem of incompetence in the market by the industry. Hence an economical and faster method of changeover have to be adopted. In this work, the set-up time for fabric roll (raw material) was considered for improvement. Implementing SMED, the change over time is decreased, and thereby productivity improvement was obtained. Also, there was a good improvement in the reduction of raw material wastage.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films', 'Energy Systems']"

A method for setting up the waiting area and coordinating the traffic signal between the approach lanes and the loop lanes is proposed. With the help of the loop lane space, the through and left-turn waiting areas are set up, and the traffic flow in each direction at the roundabout is separated by a coordinated traffic signal, in order to improve the utilization rate of the space resources of the roundabout. Under saturation constraints, delay calculation models are established based on the traffic states of the approach lanes and the loop lanes, and a signal control parameter optimization model is established with the goal of minimizing the delay. The simulation results show that the proposed method can satisfy the required conditions for roundabouts with high traffic volume.","['Engineering', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Energy Policy, Economics and Management', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

This rationalization was achieved thanks to the geometric properties of principal patches arising from a Triply Orthogonal system of Surfaces (TOS). By using such a system we were able to generate a curvilinear coordinate system where the coordinate lines are principal curves on the respective surfaces in the TOS. Next, generate 3D components (voxels) where each voxel is a curvilinear cube where its sides are principal patches, and its edges are principal curves obtained by intersecting two neighboring surfaces from each of the three families in the TOS. These voxels are then rationalized into rational-voxels having planar/developable faces and straight/planar edges. The design model allows for five degrees of design freedom for choosing: (1) the shell-slice type in the TOS, (2) the shell-slice thickness, (3) the voxel-assembly method, (4) the rational-voxel type and (5) being either a solid or a hollow voxel-assembly.

The impact response of multilayer structures is simulated using the equations of the generalized two-dimensional discrete structure theory. It is based on expanding all the components of the displacement vector of each layer into power series for the transverse coordinate. This theory takes into account all the components of the strain tensor in the layers and the spatial character of the strain of the multilayer structure close to the impact point. The impact of a ball with a homogeneous steel plate and a sandwich with a soft filler is considered. The paper also describes the experimental method for investigating the properties of materials under high deformation rate conditions. The specimens were investigated experimentally with a constant deformation rate. A pneumatic gun launches the projectile to cause tension of the specimen and dynamometer bar. The wideband strain gauge method is used to register their deformation. The true tension diagram of the material investigated is found from the equality of longitudinal forces in the specimen and dynamometer bar. The data obtained on the dynamometer bar are definitive ones for building this diagram, whereas the data obtained on the specimen are used for controlling the constancy of the specimen deformation rate. The strength properties of steel flat specimens were investigated under conditions of static and high-velocity loading. The strength parameters of the material are found to increase substantially with an increasing deformation rate.","['Energy', 'Energy Systems', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Structural Materials', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer']"

Their static and dynamic structural performance is fundamental to ensure a proper thermal insulation. Two multi-material composite beam topologies were tested in a three-point bending, while one was subjected to an experimental frequency response analysis. FEM models were created for the composite beams, using beam elements (BEAM189) and solid elements (SOLID186) with a shared topology configuration. Their capacity to predict the static and dynamic behaviour of the beams was assessed by comparing the numerical results with the experimental and analytical data. It is shown that the three-point bending behaviour of the physical beam could not be realistically captured by the 1D beam elements model, as their cross section with different components could not be coupled due to the relatively low stiffness of the polymeric components. However, the eigenfrequencies from the beam elements were very close to those measured experimentally, meaning the dynamic modulus at low strain values could keep the beam’s cross section in-plane during the experiment. On the other hand, the 3D solid elements had the opposite outcome, agreeing with the experimental three-point bending test but not with the experimental modal analysis.","['Materials Science', 'Materials Science, general', 'Classical and Continuum Physics', 'Materials Engineering', 'Characterization and Evaluation of Materials']"

However, the integration of humans within Industry 4.0 need to be considered as many industrial settings still make use of mixed environments. Within these environments the completion of processes are dependent on the cooperation between human workers and automated systems. At this time there is limited research on the development of collaborative decision-making where the human’s adjustment and acknowledgment to the method is taken into consideration. A research gap identifying the lack of processes involving collaborative decision-making, has been established as the productive setup of an automated system relies greatly on the Human–Machine Interaction (HMI) between the machines and the human operator. The case study of a water bottling plant is utilized in this research to create a separation between the collection of tasks that need to be done by a machine as well as a human related to a Smart Manufacturing Environment. Even though the new technologies employed in Industry 4.0 may predict or detect a shift in procedure, human intervention and decision-making are still of critical importance. The paper initially discusses how the water bottling plant was modeled. Secondly, the paper then discusses collaborative decision-making with reference to possible models for collaborative decision-making and introduces a HMI used for intervention in the automated process. The paper is rounded off by discussing the results and impact of collaborative decision-making in the automated procedure related to the case study.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-17457-5_6,en,A Theoretical Investigation of the Impact of Blood-Endothelium Mechanical Interactions on the Cerebral Nitric Oxide Biotransport,OriginalPaper,"Cerebral nitric oxide (NO), a small diffusive molecule, plays a critical role in brain’s functionality. More precisely, NO acts as a neuro-glial-vascular messenger that aids various chemo-mechanical communications among brain cells, blood, and cerebral vasculature. A disequilibrium in the NO bioavailability and/or a delay in (or lack of) interactions of NO with other molecules due to, for instance, inflammation can lead to the onset and progression of cerebrovascular diseases. Mathematical models of cerebral NO biotransport can provide essential insights into mechanisms of cerebrovascular diseases that may lead to the development of better preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods. In this chapter, a two-dimensional space-fractional reaction-diffusion equation is proposed to model cerebral NO biotransport. The equation uses spatial fractional order derivatives to describe NO anomalous diffusion caused by the experimentally observed entrapping of NO in circulating endothelial microparticles. Cerebrovascular diseases cause an increase in the amount of endothelial microparticles and thus may lead to an enhanced anomalous diffusion of NO. The model includes the NO production by synthesis in neurons and by shear-induced mechanotransduction in the endothelial cells, and the loss of NO due to its interactions with superoxide and hemoglobin. The blood-endothelium mechanical interactions contribute to the shear-induced production of NO. Perturbation series solutions for the coupled blood-endothelium mechanics are adapted from literature for two cases: impermeable and permeable endothelium. Thus, the viscous dissipation at the blood-endothelium interface can be calculated analytically. The model generalizes a published one-dimensional model of cerebral NO anomalous diffusion in which the blood flow effect on the vascular wall was modeled as a mere oscillatory boundary condition. Numerical simulations suggest that for NO anomalous diffusion of fractional order 0.85 and in the presence of endothelial permeability and blood flow, the NO concentration at the endothelium increases in time which agrees with studies of stroke.","['Materials Science', 'Materials Science, general', 'Biomaterials', 'Structural Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

Unfortunately, current methods require too much user involvement and fail to capture their true preferences. In fact, to avoid the nuisance of manually setting preferences, users usually accept the default settings even if these do not conform to their true preferences. Norms can be useful to regulate behaviour and ensure it adheres to user preferences but, while the literature has thoroughly studied norms, most proposals take a formal perspective. Indeed, while there has been some research on constructing norms to capture a user’s privacy preferences, these methods rely on domain knowledge which, in the case of AI technologies, is difficult to obtain and maintain. We argue that a new perspective is required when constructing norms, which is to exploit the large amount of preference information readily available from whole systems of users. Inspired by recommender systems, we believe that collaborative filtering can offer a suitable approach to identifying a user’s norm preferences without excessive user involvement.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The present paper explains the creation of an Asset Score based upon which prioritisation strategy is arrived for maintenance works for a road network. The road having the highest Asset Score would be given the highest priority for maintenance and likewise will be continued for the remaining roads. Asset Score is created by using a multi-criteria decision-making tool, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The parameters used for determining the asset score included pavement condition rating, traffic volume (total traffic and number of commercial vehicles), number of access points, crash rate, drainage factor and congestion. The pairwise comparison matrix for AHP is constructed based on experts’ opinion acquired through survey. The AHP calculations are carried out in normal method and on Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. The results achieved in two cases were similar. Asset scores gives the prioritization order of road which in turn helps the highway engineers and planners to identify the stretch where the maintenance has to be done, the type of maintenance required and ensure allocation of resources which aids in an effective maintenance. Moreover, the advanced options on GIS software assist to perform analysis which makes the computations easier. GIS can be used not only for mapping but the advanced options enhance the GIS as a powerful tool for analysis.","['Engineering', 'Construction Management', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences']"

First, the time-varying modal parameters of the structure are identified using the input–output dynamic data recorded during a damaging seismic event by employing a short-time windowing approach. Then, the identified modal parameters are used to update a linear FE model of the structure using a Bayesian approach. Global sensitivity analysis based on Sobol’ indices is employed to select the most influential parameters for the model updating stage. The evolution of the equivalent stiffness of different elements of the FE model are tracked and their estimation uncertainties are also quantified. The method is verified using numerically simulated data of a two-dimensional nonlinear FE model of a nine-story steel frame.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Structural Materials', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

The scope of the complexes is indefinite and poorly formalized environments. It is possible to achieve the desired efficiency of such complexes mainly by improving the intellectual component of their control system and a separate unit in particular. However, it should be noted that the vast majority of research in this area remains at the theoretical level. There is a gap between primitive behavior models of artificial entities, for example in swarm robotics, models of their interaction and expectations from practice. The situation is aggravated by the requirements of secrecy, miniaturization, and low power consumption. The work objective is to propose an approach to developing software for intelligent control systems for a separate network node with a given autonomy degree in performing tasks. To propose relatively simple algorithms for giving a network node the intelligent behavior properties under power consumption and speed restrictions; to provide the ability to study the situation and make decisions, both independently taking into account the data received from other network devices and as part of a group. Methods. The paper uses the methods of fuzzy set theory, the theory of building fuzzy models and networks, as well as approaches and algorithms for building on-board intelligent control systems. Results. It is shown that the required algorithms can be developed after identifying typical situation classes and successful action methods in real conditions. This basis makes it possible to develop formal behavior models (patterns) for implementation in the node management system.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It is important to identify input process parameters for maintaining stable and continuous trouble-free operation. A priori modelling and solution of governing phenomenological equations to achieve this requires tedious computational efforts. As an alternative in this work we have employed Machine learning to build data driven EFC classification models to predict stability of any given set of operating conditions. We have used accurate input data for certain combinations of parameters along with their respective output classes to build robust classification models. We used Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest classifiers for this purpose. We created four different data sets with different process parameter combinations and number of relaxation modes. We also used the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to handle data imbalance. Our simulation results indicate that prediction of stability/instability classes for different process parameters can be achieved with high degree of confidence with robust machine learning models.,"['Engineering', 'Data Engineering', 'Statistics, general', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Storage Representation', 'Data Structures and Information Theory']"

Technology has allowed us to utilise imaging techniques for the visualisation of anatomical features, pathology and correlating physiological functions in a non-invasive manner which is atypical to traditional forms of anatomical investigation. These imaging methods develop integration between anatomy and clinically oriented medical study as well as biomechanics. The progressive research in anatomy can benefit from the vast field of biomechanics which allows for precise and conclusive results regarding the biomechanical integrity of anatomical structures and allows for intricate planning of procedures. 3D imaging techniques have enhanced the modelling of internal structures which are especially essential when implemented as diagnostic tools. An integration of these modalities into medical training accommodates for a more clinically orientated and immediate visualisation as produced when utilising ultrasound imaging which has the added advantage of 3D modelling and manipulation.

From the literature, it has been found that, using apparent shear force (ASF) concept at the interface of floodplain and main channel, the accurate discharge can be predicted. ASF is a function of various non-dimensional parameters such as channel width ratio (α), relative flow depth (β), main channel aspect ratio (δ), relative roughness (γ), bed slope (S 0 ), Froude number (Fr), and side slope (m). In this paper, an attempt has been made to model ASF by considering the aforementioned non-dimensional parameters. A total of 152 datasets have been collected from various literatures related to ASF. In the recent days, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques are widely used to model hydrological and hydraulic flow problems. In this research work, two soft computing techniques such as support vector machine (SVM) and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) have been utilized to model apparent shear force at the two-stage channel. First, SVM has been successfully used in classification and then extended for regression analysis. The SVM classification methods are based on the principle of optimal separation of classes. The computation is critically dependent upon the number of training pattern and selection of hyper-parameters for regression. There are four types of SVM named as cubic SVM, fine Gaussian SVM, medium Gaussian SVM, and coarse Gaussian SVM. In ANFIS modeling, different membership functions have been utilized. All types SVMs modelling and ANFIS modelling are performed using MATLAB tool. Sensitivity analysis has also been performed to check the strength of developed model.

The application of validated techniques would not only allow the detection of overloads or structural changes according to the load-bearing behavior, it would also allow the verification of the original structural analysis. Based on an experimental modal analysis, tried and tested methods to determine the tensile forces of cables in the operating condition have existed for many years. Due to the slenderness of the cables, even normal forces have a large influence on their natural frequencies: The higher the tensile forces, the higher the geometrical system stiffness, which increases natural frequencies. An equivalent effect occurs when considering load-bearing elements subjected to compression, whereby larger compressive forces lead to a reduction in the geometrical system stiffness and thereby to a reduction in natural frequencies. While various methods have been experimentally investigated for tension cables and tension rods, only a few elaborations are known with respect to structural compression rods. This research presents a system identification method based on the experimental determination of the modal parameters of a compression steel bar. Using an iterative optimization procedure, the design parameters of a basic model including the compressive force are iteratively adjusted until the best possible agreement between the experimental measurements and a theoretical analysis is found. For this purpose, a deviation function is formulated and an evolutional algorithm — in this case facilitating a Particle Swarm Optimization — is used to solve the optimization problem. The Particle Swarm Optimization is an innovative metaheuristic algorithm that allows searching for the global minimum even for complicated nonlinear functions. The method is experimentally validated on slender steel beams with varying compressive forces. Laboratory results from three different steel profiles combined with two different bearing conditions each are presented. Therefore, six specimens were constructed and tested with four different force levels each. The average deviation over all 24 tests between the optimized force and the actual force directly measured by a load cell was determined as 7.4%.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Complexity', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Statistical Theory and Methods']"

The approach employs finite element analysis integrated into a popular software for seepage consideration and an easy-to-implement algorithm for the random field generation. Hence, a Monte Carlo method is used for the further analysis. Based on the analysis of the outcomes, there are three aspects that need to be warned when using this method. Firstly, the correct algorithm of the random number generation leads the relevant observed frequency distributions to normal-distribution shapes. Secondly, the refinement of mesh can lead to more accurate results in terms of numerical issues but that can change the scale of fluctuation of random field. Finally, a number of 500 samples for a Monte Carlo simulation is acceptable.","['Energy', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Structural Materials', 'Geotechnical Engineering & Applied Earth Sciences', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Construction Management', 'Environmental Policy']"

Such activities result in an uneven relaxation within the soil, forming undesirable settlements and imposing stress conditions, which are unaccounted for in the design process. Ground settlements can inflict serious, and in some cases, irreparable damage to pre-existing structures. Understanding the impact such settlements could have on structural systems is vital in developing effective preventative measures that would help mitigate such effects. Hence, this study investigates the effects of the differential settlement on a reinforced concrete framed structure by examining the structural behaviour considering different spans and heights. The nonlinear behaviour of the structure is simulated through two-dimensional (2D) frame finite element simulations. The propagation of mechanical damage within the structural members and the plastic hinge formation with respect to the induced settlements are then analyzed. The affect of ductility on the frame’s behaviour is demonstrated, and comparisons with settlement tolerances proposed in literature are drawn to assess the effectiveness of these limits.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

Geotechnical data generated by GANs shows similar characteristics as the original data, but still presents unique samples with no connection to the technical content of the original data. The data can therefore be made available publicly without any legal issues. A WGAN (Wasserstein GAN) algorithm is used to generate synthetic tunnel boring machine (TBM) operational data based on real data from a major European tunnel construction site. The demands on the synthetic TBM data are of a dualistic nature: on the one hand, the data has to be sufficiently dissimilar to the original data, so that it does not create confidentiality issues (demand for originality). On the other hand, it has to show the same patterns and follow the same rules as the original data, so that it can be used as if it were real TBM data (demand for conformity). The WGAN model describes how a synthetic dataset is generated, in terms of a probabilistic model based on real data. By sampling from this model, we are able to generate new, unique synthetic and realistic TBM data. We show that the demands for originality and conformity of the newly generated data are fulfilled.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Statistics, general']"

The objective is to steer all the evaders towards a desired tracking reference while avoiding escapes. The problem is very challenging due to the highly complex repulsive evaders’ dynamics and the underdetermined states to control. We propose a solution that is based on Implicit Control and a novel dynamic assignment strategy to select the evaders to be directly controlled. The former is a general technique that explicitly computes control inputs even in highly complex input-nonaffine dynamics. The latter is built upon a convex-hull dynamic clustering inspired by the Voronoi tessellation problem. The combination of both allows to choose the best evaders to directly control, while the others are indirectly controlled by exploiting the repulsive interactions among them.

The paleoneurology of Pan-Sirenia and Sirenia is based on anatomical descriptions of approximately two dozen natural and digital cranial endocasts and a couple of bony labyrinth endocasts. Sirenian brains are characterized by lissencephalic cerebral hemispheres, reduced olfactory system, reduction in the optic nerves, presence of a large trigeminal nerve and associated components, and thick meninges of the central nervous system. In contrast to other modern paenungulates, which include the gyrencephalic and large-brained elephants, sirenians have lissencephalic brains whose components are linearly arranged, and small relative brain sizes (EQs).

Two industrial bonding processes were investigated, one from electronic potting and another from the manufacturing industry. The focus was on optimizing the plasma treatment of the substrate materials. Two approaches for optimization were compared, namely the traditional approach where the adhesive expert proposes experiments and interpret the results, and an AI approach with Bayesian optimization and Gaussian process models. Similar joint strengths could be achieved via the Bayesian optimization approach with 40% less budget to find the optimum compared to the traditional approach. Additionally, in the electronic potting process, the AI approach resulted in 18% reduction in production cost, while achieving a similar joint strength, compared to the traditional approach. Ageing of the samples did not result in a significant drop in joint strength nor changes in failure type or mechanism. This indicates that AI can support adhesive experts to find the optimal bonding process settings and manufacture robust and cost-efficient adhesive bonds.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering', 'Solid Mechanics', 'Inorganic Chemistry', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Physical Chemistry']"

Since the work shop scheduling issues are directly tied to energy consumption, using an effective scheduling method is an excellent way to save energy in industrial plants. In industrial environments, scheduling systems often accord a major emphasis on the time factor in the production processes. In this context, this paper deals with a real industrial Flow-shop Scheduling problem (FSP) within the Med light company. This company makes several kinds of lighting equipments. This industrial FSP is modeled by incorporating a green production parameter. Indeed, this model integrates energy awareness by incorporating the energy consumption in the flow-shop scheduling system. Two objectives are minimized simultaneously: the energy consumption and the makespan. In order to solve this industrial problem, a Hybrid Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (HMOGA) is implemented. The obtained results (jobs sequences) improve the performance of the flow-shop scheduling problem compared to the existing solution in the company. The used HMOGA method offers the decision maker different compromise job sequences, which allows to pick the appropriate solution according to his preference between these two contradictory goals (the makespan and the energy consumption).","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Materials Engineering', 'Classical and Continuum Physics']"

This has led to the evolution of cutting-edge fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks. Few of the well-known techniques for boosting 5G networks are non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), small cell deployment (a.k.a. HetNets), millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), etc. One of the basic elements of the physical layer of a wireless network is the multiple access (MA) techniques. The MA techniques deviate in each generation and have grown from frequency division multiple access, used in the first generation, to orthogonal frequency division multiple access, which is adequately accepted in the 4G network. NOMA (MA scheme that violates the criteria of orthogonality) has been considered a promising multiple access technique for the 5G networks. NOMA supports a huge number of connected users (or devices), lowers latency, and boosts spectral efficiency. Accordingly, the application of NOMA is essential in investigating the 5G network and beyond. Furthermore, NOMA is compatible with recent techniques, such as HetNets, device to device (D2D) communication, mmWave, and IRS. This integrates NOMA with the contending 5G and beyond techniques of great research interest and is presented in this chapter. This chapter introduces a scenario in which a heterogeneous cellular network (HCN) is considered with three tiers, namely, macro base station (macroBS) tier underlaid with femto base station (femtoBS) tier, and D2D tier. NOMA principle is applied in the femtoBS tier and the D2D tier, while the macroBS tier does not use NOMA. Offloading from the macroBS tier to the femtoBS tier aids in tackling congestion at the macroBS tier. The cooperation introduced using the D2D tier further supports the offloaded macro user (macroU) from the macroBS tier. This support is primarily helpful when the femtoBS tier is using NOMA, and the femtoBS tier is unable to find a pairing user for the offloaded macroU.

Contemporary methods introduced for the analysis of RVV primarily aimed at partitioning the signal in the time- or time − frequency domain, providing differing segments of a signal. However, a degree of dissimilarity, or conversely similarity, is still challenging to find. Hereunder we argue that in some cases, merely a statement of dissimilarity between neighbouring segments within a signal might be well-enough, though from a broader perspective, the assessment of the similarity of discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) may be the next practical step forward. For this reason, the current paper presents the hierarchical clustering of elements of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) plane from an RVV measurement; secondly, it introduces a clustering validation metric to arrive at an optimum distance metric and a threshold to use in binary hierarchical clusters.","['Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering']"

In general missions, the spacecraft’s orbit forecast ephemeris is used to calculate the epoch and azimuth angle corresponding to a fixed elevation angle under the station coordinate system, and use this as the guidance information. For autonomously controlled spacecraft, the ground system cannot accurately simulate the motion process of the spacecraft and predict the orbit. When the predicted orbit deviation is large, the use of the above method may cause the equipment to fail to capture. In order to solve the problem, a spacecraft station guidance calculation method based on combined deviation orbit prediction is proposed. When the station uses the guidance data calculated by this method to capture, it only needs to wait at the theoretical waiting point, and the waiting time is a certain interval. The method makes the station operation simple and easy to judge the tracking situation.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics']"

Due to lack of transparency, privacy, biased systems, lack of governance and accountability, our society demands toolsets to create responsible AI solutions for enabling of unbiased AI systems. These solutions will help business owners to create AI applications which are trust enhancing, open and transparent and also explainable. Properly made systems will enhance trust among employees, business leaders, customers and other stakeholders. The process of overseeing artificial intelligence usage and its influence on related stakeholders belongs to the context of AI Governance. Our work gives a detailed overview of a governance model for Responsible AI, emphasizing fairness, model explainability, and responsibility in large-scale AI technology deployment in real-world organizations. Our goal is to provide the model developers in an organization to understand the Responsible AI with a comprehensive governance framework that outlines the details of the different roles and the key responsibilities. The results work as reference for future research is aimed to encourage area experts from other disciplines towards embracement of AI in their own business sectors, without interpretability shortcoming biases.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The GAP algorithm does not require the design of either an explicit world model or a reward function to drive policy determination, and is capable of operating on both MDP and RL domain problems. The construction of the GAP lends itself to several analytic guarantees such as policy optimality, exponential goal achievement rates, reciprocal learning rates, measurable robustness to error, and explicit convergence conditions for abstracted states. Empirical results confirm these predictions, demonstrate effectiveness over a wide range of domains, and show that the GAP algorithm performance is an order of magnitude faster than standard reinforcement learning and produces plans of equal quality to MDPs, without requiring design of reward functions.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

One limitation is that most protocols do not separate or assemble (i.e., “phase”) the nucleotide content of each of the maternally and paternally derived chromosomal homologs making up the 22 autosomal pairs and the chromosomal pair making up the pseudo-autosomal region of the sex chromosomes. This has led to a dearth of studies and a consequent underappreciation of many phenomena of fundamental importance to basic and clinical genomic science. We discuss a few protocols for obtaining phase information as well as their limitations, including those that could be used in tumor phasing settings. We then describe a number of biological and clinical phenomena that require phase information. These include phenomena that require precise knowledge of the nucleotide sequence in a chromosomal segment from germline or somatic cells, such as DNA binding events, and insight into unique cis vs. trans -acting functionally impactful variant combinations—for example, variants implicated in a phenotype governed by compound heterozygosity. In addition, we also comment on the need for reliable and consensus-based diploid-context computational workflows for variant identification as well as the need for laboratory-based functional verification strategies for validating cis vs. trans effects of variant combinations. We also briefly describe available resources, example studies, as well as areas of further research, and ultimately argue that the science behind the study of human diploidy, referred to as “diplomics,” which will be enabled by nucleotide-level resolution of phased genomes, is a logical next step in the analysis of human genome biology.","['Life Sciences', 'Genetics and Genomics']"

According to the American Cancer Society, CT scans can currently diagnose lung cancer in its earliest stages. However, there are various occasions in which the doctors’ experience diagnosing lung cancer can cause some complications. Human survival rates can be improved by early identification. The average survival rate for persons with lung cancer increases from 14 to 49% if the disease is detected early. CT is significantly superior to X-ray in terms of accuracy, but a complete diagnosis needs numerous imaging modalities that work together to support one another. There is much evidence that deep learning is a popular and effective tool for medical imaging diagnosis. This paper proposes a new method of automatic diagnosis classification that has been developed for the scanned CT images of the lungs. A implementation of the Optimal Deep Neural Network (ODNN) in addition to the Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) was used in this work to analysed lung images obtained by CT scan. Malignant or benign lung nodules can be classified by obtaining in-depth features from the CT images of lungs and the redundancy of the dimensionality of the feature with Linear Dimensionality Reduction (LDR). The proposed method uses the Modified Gravitational Search Algorithm (MGSA) to shows an improvement of the ODNN’s classification of lung cancer. In terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, the proposed classifier scored 96.2%, 85.37%, and 93.33%, respectively.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It consists of small metal components located under the platforms of the blades, which dissipate the vibratory energy through friction when a relative displacement between the blades and the damper appears. It is well known that the shape of such component has a strong influence on the damping properties and should be designed with a particular attention. With the arrival of additive manufacturing, new dedicated shapes for these dampers can be considered, determined with specific numerical methods as topological optimisation (TO). However, the presence of the contact nonlinearity challenges the use of traditional TO methods to minimise the vibration levels at resonance. In this work, the topology of the damper is parametrised with the moving morphable components (MMC) framework and optimised based on meta-modelling techniques: here kriging coupled with the efficient global optimisation (EGO) algorithm. The level of vibration at resonance is computed based on the harmonic balance method augmented with a constraint to aim directly for the resonant solution. It corresponds to the objective function to be minimised. Additionally, a mechanical constraint based on static stress analysis is also considered to propose reliable damper designs. Results demonstrate the efficiency of the method and show that damper geometries that meet the engineers’ requirements can be identified.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Automotive Engineering']"

Nonstationary iterative methods for solving large sparse SLE are compared on the problem of electric potential distribution in a region. Original equation of electrostatics is discretized using the Finite Volume Method in curvilinear coordinates. The central difference scheme of the second order accuracy was involved to approximate the derivatives in equation of electrostatics.

The ILU(0) decomposition is used as a preconditioner. A residual norm serves as a convergence criterion. It was assumed that the system of linear equations is solved if current residual norm is seven orders less than the initial one.

doi:10.1007/978-981-19-1029-6_8,en,An Automated Approach to Generating Optimized Crane Mat Layout Plans,OriginalPaper,"The modular construction approach is capable of increasing the speed at which buildings are constructed. To accomplish this, the designers and practitioners front-load these modules with a broad range of features to reduce the amount of on-site construction work required. Consequently, the modules have become heavier over time, which has led to an increase in the amount of on-site crane work and the resources required on-site for the safe installation of these modules. One of the main safety concerns is whether the ground support has the capacity to hold and stabilize these heavy cranes with a dynamic payload. Crane mats are often employed to offer ground support in the case of poor soil bearing capacity, avoiding ground failure that may result in crane collapse. Due to the increased usage of crane mats, there has been a subsequent increase in the demand on the practitioner’s time to prepare mat layout plans and/or drawings for the construction site. To reduce the amount of time required, the present study provides a novel automated mat layout optimization algorithm as an application that can develop mat layout plans taking into account mat laying constraints. An agent-based optimization approach is applied such that the maximum area is covered using a minimum number of mats, avoiding overlapping, and mats are placed starting from one edge of the area as required (payload pick and/or setting point). The results indicate that the practitioner’s time to prepare the mat layout plans/drawings using the developed optimization application can be reduced significantly (90%).","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

Furthermore, augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) will be introduced to convert constrained problem (i.e. primal problem) into unconstrained one (i.e. barrier problem) and penalty term will be added to cost function. Meanwhile, particle swarm optimization (PSO) will be applied to optimize the parameter vector, including system states, control inputs and Lagrangian multipliers, evaluating the cost function at each iteration during the simulation until reaching the minimum value of cost function, which also suggests that the particles are converged, and the parameter vector is optimized. The main contribution of the study is to propose a hybrid optimal solver for the constrained optimization problem, an augmented Lagrangian particle swarm optimization (ALPSO), and comparison results between the self-build ALPSO solver, MATLAB built-in fmincon function, and the theoretical ones, verifying the correctness of the self-build solver for constrained optimization problems with accuracy of 15.49 m maximum error during the whole one thousand meters of flight.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

Inversion of resistivity data using deep learning models had been applied in previous works where it addresses the time-consuming process and inaccurate generation of maps obtained from the conventional iterative process of inversion. The present study contributes to state of the art by training and evaluating the deep learning inversion model dedicated for CRI, which previous works were limited for use with DC ERT surveys. A synthetic dataset of several subsurface resistivity models and expected CRI equipment recordings were generated. Then four deep learning architectures, namely U-Net, SegNet, Wavelet U-Net, and Wavelet SegNet, were trained and evaluated using the synthetic dataset. Results revealed that the Wavelet U-Net performed best among the considered architectures as it had the lowest mean square error, second highest R 2 , and a more accurate resistivity map generated from a sample in the dataset. All deep learning inversion models produced one sample resistivity map, with a survey length of 100 m, within 1 s compared with the Res2dinv software (iterative method), which took 40 s. Overall, the study concludes that the trained deep learning 2D inversion models, especially Wavelet U-Net, can invert CRI data to a high degree of accuracy at a fast computational speed, which becomes essential when requiring real-time and on-site results and dealing with long surveys.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

The goal is to find the minimum number of vehicles and human resources required for transportation. Guided by the main provisions of lean manufacturing and transport logistics, the task of developing an optimal schedule for the operation of land vehicles and optimizing the number of labor resources was implemented on the example of the work of a conditional motor transport enterprise. We present an algorithm that allows us to solve this problem using a class of interval graphs. A mathematical model of cargo transportation is constructed using an algorithm for coloring the interval graph with a sequential distribution and uniform loading of colors. In the course of solving this problem, software was created that implements the operation of such an algorithm. This software tool allows you to perform calculations to find the optimal amount of resources under given initial conditions, with a uniform system load, provided that the colors of the interval graph are consistently distributed.

These materials are frequently used in automotive components such as electric machines, battery packages, controller units, automotive actuators, and car multimedia applications. The research aims to examine the ecological effects of the rare-earth material usage and carefully analyse the market needs for rare-earth materials. It is essential to investigate how the other fields of the market (like consumer electronics or telecommunication) can affect the field of electromobility regarding rare-earth content usage. Rare earth magnets are key components for tablets, cell phones and many other electronic devices. It is very unlikely that the major electronic device manufacturers are decreasing their rare-earth material consumption despite the increasing demand for e-mobility. Statistic methodologies are used to conclude the rare-earth material usage. The geopolitical situation and the geographical distribution of the rare-earth production are all essential parts of this article. The recycling rates of the rare-earth materials and the rare-earth-material-based magnets are relatively low compared to other base materials in electromobility. The impact of the low recycling rates, together with the increasing demand for rare-earth materials, lead to a business situation which triggers engineering activities focusing on partially or fully rare-earth material free solutions. In this article, the current situation in the rare-earth market is analysed and conclusions are drawn regarding the predicted future situation.

This paper compares the performance of three nature-inspired algorithms, namely a genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimisation (PSO), and simulated annealing (SA), to that of the more conventional Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA). The model of a simple infiltration experiment is used, with a saturated sample on top of a dry sample in a sealed environment. Synthetic data are first generated representing measurements of pressure heads mid-point in each layer.

However, with different machine learning techniques though either feature reduction is used, or feature extraction is used, both have its own merits and de-merits. The proposed work proposes a hybrid model that tries to combine the feature extraction and feature reduction techniques thereby using both linear and non-linear techniques to take the best parts of both methods. After the initial ensemble is created still the feature set is further optimized by using the concept of entropy and information gain. Using mutual information, on further analysis the best non-redundant feature sets are selected after considering a specific threshold and using this as a testing tool the datasets are again analyzed to check the working accuracy. The model performance is found to be effective even using reduced feature sub-set.

Modal parameters are often adopted to define damage-sensitive features, since their strong physical meaning can help interpreting the structural condition. On the other hand, they are also sensitive to changes to environmental and operational conditions. This aspect is critical for an automatic damage detection, because changes in modal parameters due to varying external factors (e.g. temperature) can be greater than those caused by damage. In this context, this paper proposes an application to real data coming from long-term structural health monitoring of axially-loaded beam-like structures under realistic environment. These very common structural elements are usually subject to an axial load that changes under environmental and operating conditions. Since the axial load is not directly known in most real applications, assessing damage using modal-based damage features is a complicated task. In this paper, a data driven approach that does not require a knowledge of the axial load is proposed to filter out the environmental effects on modal-based damage features. The strategy has been successfully tested on data acquired in an uncontrolled environment, and resulted in being a promising solution for real structural health monitoring applications.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Thermoplastic polymers were used as a material that comes in the form of a filament. Copper is highly known for its electrical conductivity, high thermal resistance, and corrosion resistance. However, PLA's characteristics embedded with Copper particles still remain limited. The aim of this study is to investigate and analyze the tensile properties of the specimens with varying infill percentages (25, 50, and 75%) and infill patterns (Honeycomb, rectilinear, concentric, grid, and triangle) on Copper reinforced PLA using the FDM technique. The specimen is printed in accordance with the ASTM standard for tensile testing. Following that, the tensile properties of the PLA and the PLA/Copper composite were analyzed. The triangle pattern for the PLA/Copper composite has the same strength as the Concentric pattern of pure PLA. The results demonstrate that the concentric infill pattern with a 75% percentage of infill of pure PLA and the PLA/Copper composite has the same value in the overall tensile strength.

In addition to heat treatment technology and increased tooth fillet surface quality, large cutter tip corners can increase the capability to carry a load of transmissions. Modifying the involute geometry can also increase the capability to carry a load. It is possible to make the gears asymmetric by giving the power side a different pressure angle from the tooth side. By employing asymmetric teeth, gears can perform better, including the increased capability to carry a load, less bending stress, and increased resistance to wear on the drive side. The effect of asymmetric gears with a larger pressure angle on the drive side than on the coast side was explored in this study. In addition to the aforementioned changes, it has been demonstrated that changing the root fillet radius can lower bending stresses. Because the bending force is reduced, small gears or lighter gears can be produced. This advantage allows gears to be used in a larger range of industries, including aerospace and automotive.

doi:10.1007/978-981-19-7100-6_14,en,Impact of Anthropocene on the Fluvial Sediment Supply: The Mahanadi River Basin Perspective,OriginalPaper,"The Mahanadi River basin is the third biggest in central India and the longest in the state of Odisha. The peninsular river basin has a significant history of watershed land use changes and human disturbances in the channel. The Mahanadi Delta, located on India’s east coast, is a hybrid delta formed by water, suspended and bed sediments, and minerals from a web of distributaries of the Mahanadi River system. The current state of research on the quantification of river sediment supply and its connection to human catchment disturbances is discussed in this chapter, with an emphasis on the physical characteristics of the river basin. Nonparametric time series assessment methods are used to examine the annual runoff and suspended sediment characteristics of the gauging stations of the basin. The function of various attributes influencing runoff and suspended sediment dynamics of the gauging stations is also investigated. The average correlation between the discharge and suspended sediment load (SSL) is studied using sediment rating curves (SRC). Also, the role of differential supply of sediments from the watershed is characterized using the hysteresis analysis of suspended sediments. The development of the Mahanadi coastline subjected to the regulated sediment supply from the catchment in terms of land loss and gain is evaluated using geospatial data. The statistics of hydrological data reveal a large seasonal variance, with the monsoon being the most dominant. The annual SSL distributions are more irregular and non-normal relative to yearly runoff. The investigation of hysteresis loops revealed that the supply of sediments also significantly affected the transport capacity of all the channels within the basin. A substantial loss in SSL is evident throughout the majority of the stations in comparison to a negligible change in water outflow. Besides, 81% of the stations show a 2-year periodicity in runoff and SSL. Also, the flow of SSL to the ocean has fallen nearly three times more than the annual runoff, which is alarming. It, therefore, shows the strong impact of artificial force relative to natural variations. The statistical estimates for seashore morphological changes on a volumetric basis show that coastal landscapes prone to erosion are susceptible. The rating parameters vary inversely due to intense human-induced activities throughout the catchment. The rise in withdrawal over time for non-monsoon irrigation and hydropower generation is observed from the release of water from the reservoirs. The demand for thermal power stations has increased fourfold in the recent decade, significantly increasing water utilization. Overall, large impoundments, excessive water distribution across multiple business sectors, and varying watershed soil management efforts are highlighted as critical anthropogenic attributes impacting the decline in catchment sediment transport and eventually causing the delta to retreat. Further studies in the basin should focus on the impact of future land use on the sediment budget of the Mahanadi delta. This study aims to shed light on the dynamics of runoff and suspended sediment load over the past five decades and to fill in shortcomings about the evolving nature of rivers in the Mahanadi River basin.","['Life Sciences', 'Ecosystems', 'Ecology']"

A technique in the modal domain called Nonlinear Coupling Procedure (NLCP) has been recently defined to couple subsystems connected through nonlinear connections by using their Nonlinear Normal Modes (NNMs). It manages to capture the main dynamic features of the system, i.e., the backbone of each NNM, and it provides satisfactory results in terms of mode shape and resonance frequency as function of the excitation level of the assembled system, with a considerable reduction of the computational time. However the results may be inaccurate due to approximations either in the models of the subsystems or due to the considered coupling technique. Furthermore, nonlinear subsystems can be the cause of complex behaviors of the assembly and then their models need to be carefully characterized. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate the reliability of the method in terms of the accuracy of the solution. This is done by defining a reliability ratio based on energy concepts depending on the level of the excitation acting on the system. The effectiveness of the reliability ratio of nonlinear techniques is verified on the NLCP applied to a mechanical system with localized nonlinearities.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Civil Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

This family of approaches utilizes a series of responses of the full-order model to assemble a suitable basis, subsequently employed to formulate a set of equivalent, low-order equations through projection. However, in a nonlinear setting, physics-based ROMs require an additional approximation to circumvent the bottleneck of projecting and evaluating the nonlinear contributions on the reduced space. This scheme is termed hyper-reduction and enables substantial computational time reduction. The aforementioned hyper-reduction scheme implies a trade-off, relying on a necessary sacrifice on the accuracy of the nonlinear terms’ mapping to achieve rapid or even real-time evaluations of the ROM framework. Since time is essential, especially for digital twins representations in structural health monitoring applications, the hyper-reduction approximation serves as both a blessing and a curse. Our work scrutinizes the possibility of exploiting machine learning (ML) tools in place of hyper-reduction to derive more accurate surrogates of the nonlinear mapping. By retaining the POD-based reduction and introducing the machine learning-boosted surrogate(s) directly on the reduced coordinates, we aim to substitute the projection and update process of the nonlinear terms when integrating forward in time on the low-order dimension. Our approach explores a proof-of-concept case study based on a Nonlinear Auto-regressive neural network with eXogenous Inputs (NARX-NN), trying to potentially derive a superior physics-based ROM in terms of efficiency, suitable for (near) real-time evaluations.

The flow past bluff bodies with circular and square shaped cylinders have been studied extensively in the literature. However, limited studies are reported on flow past elliptical cylinders, even though they are preferred in many practical applications due to smaller wake region and drag coefficients. In this work, we develop a numerical model using meshless particle method known as smoothed particle hydrodynamics to analyse the fluid-structure interaction of a stationary elliptic cylinder in a steady viscous fluid flow for Reynolds numbers varying from 10 to 60. Qualitative comparison of the obtained results shows good agreement with the existing results in the literature. We believe that the developed model can be further extended to investigate the fluid dynamics of more complicated problems involving movable and deformable objects.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Solid Mechanics', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-07258-1_106,en,Exploiting Sparseness in Damage Characterization: A Close Look at the Regularization Techniques,OriginalPaper,"The idea of exploiting sparseness in under-determined damage characterization problems is not new, and regularizations techniques that tend to promote sparseness, such as L1-norm minimization, have been investigated in the last ten years or so. Although various claims of merit have been made, two interconnected issues put these claims into question, and this paper brings some attention to the matter. The first is that the relationship between the structural parameters and the modal features previously considered has been linear and to ensure that the premise was closely realized, only very small damage severities have been considered. The second issue, intimately related to the first, is the fact that the noise, which has been typically taken as small relative to the “change in the features”, is then unrealistically small. In problems where the damage is sufficiently large, the nonlinear dependence of the features on the parameters cannot be generally discarded. It is found that the attainable performance is much less “impressive” that what has been often claimed. The paper also examines the potential merit of using Lp-norm (0 < p < 1) minimization, instead of L1-norm minimization which, to the knowledge of the writers, has not been previously examined in damage characterization research. In this case we also find that, contrary to claims made in other areas, this norm does not lead to any general improvement over the performance attained by minimizing the L1-norm.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Because of the considerable intra-class variability and small inter-class variability, iris classification is a difficult pattern recognition challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to iris classification based on iris fiber structures. Translation and minor deformation invariant local iris features are extracted using a scattering wavelet network. A simple generative PCA affine classifier is used to classify the resulting invariant feature vectors. Experiments on two benchmark iris databases reveal that the proposed iris classification algorithm is successful and robust in terms of classification accuracy.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

A simple analytical relationship to determine the correction coefficient was obtained as a result of data analysis. It allows to assess the degree to which change in base air flow affects air temperature change. A comparison of accuracy and reliability of the proposed approach towards assessing the air temperature changes in mine workings when airflow within them changes was conducted. In particular, it was shown that this approach allows to obtain sufficiently reliable data to assess the air temperature change in a specific location in the mine working network without requiring a demanding analysis of the status of the entire network. The value of error in the data does not exceed 10%, a boundary of error usually permitted in engineering calculations. It was determined that the correction coefficient largely changes depending on the relative increase in air flow, rather than absolute increase. At that, the larger the area of mine working’s section, the lower is the permissible increase in base airflow, regardless of initial air flow volume. The lower the base temperature in the terminal point, the stronger is the impact of increase in base air flow on air temperature. The results of variant calculations are presented in the form of 2D and 3D charts. The use of charts allows to quickly assess the values of the correction coefficient for a wide range of ventilation conditions of the underground mine workings in the cryolithic zone.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

Recently, a large number of load scheduling algorithms were developed by various experts, however these methods were not providing accurate results because of their high complexity and utilization of static datasets. To overcome these issues, an improved load scheduling method is proposed in this paper, in which loads are optimized by using the meta-heuristic Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm. In addition to this, a real-time dataset is used that is collected from the Chandigarh Region. The information about the total demand felt and met initially is extracted from the available dataset. In addition to this, the minimum hour of electricity that must be provided to the six sectors (AP, PAT, RDS, MGJG, urban and industrial) is also defined. The loads are optimized by the proposed GWO model and later on its performance is evaluated in the MATLAB software. The performance outcomes were delineated by observing the total demand felt by the providers for the month of May, June and July and the total demand met by the proposed scheme. The results proved the efficiency of the proposed GWO model as it was able to provide electricity to every sector as per the demand.","['Energy', 'Energy Systems', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks']"

This technique consists of the single selection of a spermatozoon followed by the injection of this sample into the oocyte’s plasma. The embryologists perform the ICSI by using their judgment to select the spermatozoon to inject. Additionally, they decide the best technique to penetrate the oocyte with the needle. Therefore, the success of an ICSI procedure can be affected by subjective decisions such as the characteristics of the sperm selected, the angle at which the needle pierces the oocyte, and the speed at which it is performed.

The square porous enclosed space is sinusoidally heated at the bottom based on various thermal aspect ratios ( a ) and cooled partially at the middle-half portion of the sidewalls. Considering the imposed condition of the thermal aspect ratios ( a ), the thermo-fluidic phenomena and allied thermal energy transport process altered markedly within the flow domain. The porous substance modeling is handled through Brinkman-Forchheimer-Darcy Model. The finite volume method is implemented for developing in-house computing code and the same is utilized for solving coupled transport equations. The study is conducted under the impact of various controlling variables like modified Rayleigh number (Ra m ), the permeability of the porous matrix (using Darcy number, Da), the strength of the magnetic field (using Hartmann number, Ha), nanofluid volume fraction ( $$\chi$$ χ ) and thermal aspect ratios ( a ). The thermal behavior of these cases is analyzed systematically and illustrated using streamlines, isotherms, heatlines contour, and heat transport characteristics. It is observed that the rate heat transfer is more at higher Ra m with the increasing value of thermal aspect ratio still in the existence of porous substance under the impact of the magnetic field.

These focused wave events are considered representative of the largest events that occur in a random sea state. A fully non-linear Higher-Order Spectral (HOS) solver was adopted to simulate the wave groups and investigate the physical mechanisms that govern the evolution of these events. For the near breaking uni-directional wave groups in deep-water conditions considered, it was seen that irrespective of the relative strength of the swell and wind component, the maximum crests obtained were much larger than those predicted by the commonly adopted linear and second-order solutions. Further analysis revealed that the third-order resonant interactions that alter the underlying free wave components are responsible for these larger crests. However, the most important parameter that determines the amplification was found to be bandwidth; the smaller the bandwidth, the larger the resonant interactions and hence the larger the crest elevation obtained. More importantly, it was found that for the mixed seas, once steepness and bandwidth are taken into consideration, the level of nonlinear amplification of the crests was independent of the shape of the underlying wave spectrum.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Water, general', 'Pollution, general']"

Many of antibodies from vertebrates, including camelids, have both heavy and light chain variable domains, but camelids also have antibodies that lack the light chains. In antibodies that lack light chains, the C-terminal variable region is called the V H H domain. Antibodies recognize antigens through six complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). The third CDR of the heavy chain (CDR-H3) is at the center of the antigen-binding site and is diverse in terms of sequence and structure.

In this paper, meta-structures are built by dynamically linking oscillators in a periodic pattern, which are referred to as dynamically linked element grade oscillators or D-LEGOs. The location of the band gaps is numerically determined for a one-dimensional D-LEGO. The unit cell for the D-LEGO structure is considered to be made up of two longitudinal bar elements of different properties. For such a structure, the frequency response functions (FRFs) of a single unit cell are used to estimate the band gaps of a periodic-lattice structure by adapting the Bloch wave theory. Alternatively, the FRF of the multi-unit cell is determined using FRF-based substructuring (FBS) approach. The band gaps resulting from these two approaches are compared and verified.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Statics and Structures', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Civil Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

The derivations are performed with generalized displacements and generalized momenta for a 2 DoF quarter-car model. The latter description of the problem is rarely discussed in the literature. The formulated ordinary differential equations are solved in Scilab software with Sundials/CVODE solver kind. The state-space representation of a 3 DoF system, which has active suspension, is extended with a Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) theory in order to reduce the unwanted vibrations of the road. The main aim of the formulation of the governing equations with generalized momenta compared to the generalized displacements is to directly provide the forces of the system, which gives the ability to establish a control loop easier with the force measurement of the suspension of a vehicle. Since force measurement for the case of suspension of a vehicle is more feasible compared to displacement measurement.","['Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering']"

Manufacturing in the Internet-of-Thing (IoT) era will be more efficient, better quality, easier to manage, and more transparent through integration of physical and cyber technologies in Industry 4.0-based smart factories. Factory automation relies heavily on sensors and AI to make the system intelligent. Sensor technology advancements and developments linked to Industry 4.0 serve as the backbone for the inclusive expansion of industry and the economic success of any country. It is imperative that manufacturing organizations and supply chains have access to the latest low-cost sensor technology for collecting data and putting it to good use. Standard sensor types include position sensors, flow, temperature, flow rate, pressure, and force. A wide range of fields, including motorsport, health care, manufacturing, the armed forces, and agriculture all make use of them on a day-to-day basis. Increasing efficiency through automation is the goal of Industry 4.0. The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief overview and viewpoint on the most recent advancements in AI and the associated problems. Attempts to define the main ideas and tools behind this new era of manufacturing in the early years of the so-called fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) always ended up referring to the concept of smart machines that could communicate with each other and with the environment. When it comes to the new industry 4.0, it’s the defined cyber physical systems connected by the IoT that get all the attention. Nonetheless, several tools and applications will benefit the new industrial environment, complementing the actual formation of a smart, embedded system capable of performing autonomous tasks. And the majority of these revolutionary ideas are based on the same background theory as artificial intelligence, in which the analysis and filtration of massive amounts of incoming data from various types of sensors aids in the interpretation and recommendation of the best course of action.

Their decomposition usually relies upon handcrafted designed kernels, such as the complex steerable kernels, which typically may not be optimally designed for the extraction of subtle motions specially in higher frequency domains. In this paper, optimal decomposition kernel is learned and designed directly from baseline dataset images using deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Each subpixel of an image obtained from a digital camera is included when computing the spatiotemporal information, which serves similar to an individual motion sensor to acquire the modal frequencies of a vibrating structure. A hybrid-attention-LSTM-based deep convolutional neural network architecture is developed to take advantage of attention and LSTM blocks to discover subtle motions from a specific source to visualize high resolution of dynamic properties of the structures in the existence of high amounts of noise. The idea of transfer learning is utilized to transfer the knowledge previously learned to new limited dataset. Transfer learning is used to take advantage of limited existing dataset to avoid underfitting in the training of the network, considering the current publicly available modal frequency datasets are insufficient to train a generalized network. The proposed deep learning architecture is designed in such a way that has capability of transferring the trained model from baseline dataset on a simple structure to a complicated structure using transfer learning perspective. After training, the model takes the video of a vibrating structure as input and outputs the fundamental modal frequencies. By showing reliable empirical results, the proposed model is autonomous, efficient, and accurate.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control']"

Models of the influence of research parameters, the intensity of traffic and the average mass of trains for the total duration of trains were found. Based on correlation analysis and hierarchical clustering, the influence of these parameters on the total duration of trains along the main lines at the railway region is numerically proved. Based on the results of the analysis of Dendrograms, clusters of the interdependence of lines with various routes on the network were identified. From the analysis of the hierarchical structure of clusters, a clear division into two groups can be observed, depending on the existence of a positive and negative correlation. The lines and routes that most affect the stability of train movement are determined. The results of hierarchical clustering prove that as the mass of trains increases, the duration on the route is reduced.

In structural engineering problems, metaheuristic methods including swarm-intelligence-based algorithms are used in two groups of problems. Design optimization is the first group and the design like dimension, amount of material and orientations are optimally found for minimizing objectives related to cost, weight, CO 2 emission and others. In these problems, constraints are found via design codes like steel and reinforced concrete structure design regulations. This group belongs to a design of a structure. The second group includes optimum tuning and it generally covers structural control applications. This group involves the optimum tuning of the additional control system of the structure that can be added to the newly constructed structure for better performance or existing ones to correct the failure or increase the existing performance. The role of engineers is to make the best possible structural design and optimization is important. More especially, tuning optimization is a must to provide acceptable performance. In this chapter, a review of existing studies about the design optimization of structural systems is presented for swarm intelligence-based algorithms. Then, optimum tuning applications are mentioned including the most important studies about tuned mass dampers. Finally, optimization problems are presented for design and tuning optimization. The RC retaining wall optimization was presented for two cases with and without toe projection and the optimization of a toe is 5% effective on reduction of cost.

About 50 million people worldwide are affected by epilepsy and suffer from symptomatic seizures. Proper seizure management and medications for other elements of epilepsy are critical for the proper treatment of patients with epilepsy. However, epilepsy is very diverse, making it difficult to find the optimal treatment for each patient. Therefore, early and optimized detection of epilepsy is important to find the right treatment for individual patients. Recently, various machine learning methods have been used in clinical and experimental analysis, including automatic epilepsy detection, pre-surgical planning, automatic neuroimage analysis, etc. In this study, a model for classifying subgroups of epilepsy in magnetic resonance images (MRI) is proposed. To evaluate the classification performance, we used machine quantum learning (QML) techniques, which are more efficient than traditional deep learning classification. This QML working strategy is related to quantum computing. We have used quantum convolutional neural network (QCCN) to predict the epilepsy class. This QML in a special classification test, the proposed model outperformed the conventional deep learning models. The effectiveness of quantum simulation is faster for large one-sided classification tasks due to its convergence property. QML is able to handle large biased datasets, including the highest and fastest classification computations, while consuming less time and space. To make the proposed model more trustworthy and reliable, we used Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to explain the prediction process of our model. LRP creates a heat map in the input space, similar to other visualization approaches that illustrate the importance/relevance of features that contribute to the final classification. In this paper, we describe how LRP can debunk the quantum machine learning model for feature evaluation in MRI data.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Statistics, general', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

Single-point diamond turning (SPDT) tools offer an advantage over other ultra-precision manufacturing techniques regarding speed and scalability. In this paper, the nanometric cutting of single-crystal silicon using a single-point diamond tool has been simulated using molecular dynamic simulation (MDS). The cutting forces experienced by the tool and the temperature of the workpiece were observed for both negative and positive rake angles and depth of cuts. Tersoff potentials were used in a large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS) to simulate the machining process. It was observed that the cutting temperature of the workpiece was significantly lower for the tools with negative rake angle as compared to that obtained for positive rake angles. Additionally, it was observed that forces on negative rake angle tools are more sensitive to depth of cut compared to positive rake angle tools.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Engineering Design']"

According to the literature, a CAT test should be faster to complete, more precise in estimating the student’s ability, and more engaging to take than FIT. On the other hand, a FIT test should be easier to prepare and complete, and less prone to anxiety than CAT. In this context, the paper initially reports on a study conducted with students (that used CAT and FIT) about different aspects of their assessments’ experiences. The results show that students seem to prefer CAT, considered fairer, more practical and faster than FIT, independently of the different attitudes towards technology. Furthermore, students did not report more anxiety or more workload with CAT. Moreover, we also evaluate different methods to convert the ability measured with CAT into a grade, so to verify if the adopted method could have influenced the results of the questionnaire.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Walking is an unavoidable part of almost all kind of trips especially when using public transport services such as trains and buses. Usually, pedestrians need to cross the road in order to access various residential and commercial lands for many purposes. However, many developing countries, such as India, lack suitable pedestrian crossing infrastructure. As a result, pedestrians must coexist with motor activity on the roadway. These facilities are available at a few areas, however, pedestrians are unwilling to utilize them and prefer to cross the road at their own convenience. These crossings are illegal. As previously mentioned, unlawful pedestrian crossings are fairly widespread in many nations. This study is looking into the analysis of the impact of such undesignated crossings on the speed and other traffic characteristics at various urban midblock sections in India with the use of an effective machine learning algorithm, support vector regression (SVR). When there is a large amount of data available and the variability in the data is significantly high, conventional modeling techniques fail to handle them. In that case, data-driven approaches show superior performance over other techniques. So, the prediction of speeds using SVR by considering the effects of pedestrian crossing is considered in this study, and the results are compared with results from traditional techniques. Results show that SVR outperforms the traditional models.","['Engineering', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

To strengthen the foundation, a slurry is pumped into loose rock and, when hardened, strengthens it. Deep bed filtration is accompanied by the retention of particles. Various forces act on the particles and cause them to settle on the framework of the porous medium. The most common are the capture of particles in the inlets of narrow pores and attachment to the walls of wide pores. A model with two simultaneous particle capture mechanisms is considered. The problem is reduced to a standard model with an implicit aggregated filtration function. To simplify the calculations, it was previously proposed to use an approximate model with an explicit linear-constant filtration function. The linear-constant function has a break and does not optimally approximate the aggregated filtration function. The paper introduces a linear-fractional (hyperbolic) filtration function with a free parameter. The parameter is selected from the condition of the best approximation to the aggregated function. The system of equations in partial derivatives is integrated and reduced to a system of transcendental equations. It is shown that the solution to the model with a hyperbolic filtration function is closer to the true solution than the approximate solution with a linear-constant function.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Construction Management', 'Sustainable Development', 'Regional/Spatial Science']"

However, despite its adequate performance many times the sensitivity to singularities, the physical limits of the robot actuators and the dependence on user-specific parameters are often overlooked. In this regard, this work proposes an approach to estimate the torque generated during human-robot interaction and test its effectiveness within an impedance controller that regulates this interaction. The torque estimation methodology uses the electromyographic (EMG) signal and the Hill muscle model, and the user-specific parameters are obtained from an optimization process. Experimental tests were performed to validate the estimation algorithm for continuous movements, obtaining correlation coefficients greater than 0.9. In addition, a simulation test was carried out using the estimated torque within an impedance controller to regulate robot-assisted elbow flexion movements, our controller maintaining the impedance error convergence to zero while regulate the human-robot interaction.

The domain of supply chain risk management (SCRM) has emerged, providing approaches on how to cope with risks in SC. However, due to increased complexity, volatility, and uncertainty, the number of risks in global SC has increased significantly. Harnessing the power of predictive analytics (PA), implemented in intelligent decision support systems (IDSS), offers huge potential in SCRM. However, research at the intersection of the domains of SCRM, PA, and IDSS is still in its infancy, and several research gaps have yet to be addressed. The paper elaborates on these research gaps by means of a systematic literature review. The results include a set of seven research questions and proposed research directions for future studies. Future research is presented with a plethora of starting points, which originate from the business perspective (i.e., the SCRM domain), the data-driven (i.e., the PA domain) as well as an IT-system perspective (i.e., the IDSS domain).","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Numerical simulations demonstrate that such connectivity-based traffic control is beneficial for smoothness and energy efficiency of highway traffic.

Hybrid algorithms employed for the static obstacle collision avoidance are proved to be efficient as compared to conventional algorithms. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm that consumes less computational time during static obstacle avoidance is introduced. A hybrid algorithm combining Lazy Probabilistic Road Map (PRM) algorithm as well as Life Long Planning (LPA) star algorithm is employed for generating an optimized path from start node to end node.

The potential biohazards associated with plastic manufacturing industries resulting from the chemical breakdown to toxic components present a challenging technological issue. While the petroleum-based plastic market is predicted to shrink marked by a notable effort toward an emerging bioplastic market bearing a low environmental load, the shift is expected to abolish the dependency on plastic use in a plastic-free society. The bioplastic growth trajectory is discretely rising, but advancements have been dampened by price economics and the underperformance of biobased plastics due to material properties in comparison to their counterparts.

Inventory management is a highly relevant topic, as it causes high costs such as holding, shortage, and reordering costs. Especially the event of a stock-out can cause damage that goes beyond monetary damage in the form of lost sales. To minimize those costs is the task of an optimized reorder policy. A reorder policy is optimal when it minimizes the accumulated cost in every situation. However, finding an optimal policy is not trivial. First, the problem is highly stochastic as we need to consider variable demands and lead times. Second, the supply chain consists of several warehouses incl. the factory, global distribution warehouses, and local affiliate warehouses, whereby the reorder policy of each warehouse has an impact on the optimal reorder policy of related warehouses. In this context, we discuss the concept of multi-echelon inventory optimization and a methodology that is capable of capturing both, the stochastic behavior of the environment and how it is impacted by the reorder policy: Markov decision processes (MDPs). On this basis, we introduce the concept, its related benefits and weaknesses of a methodology named Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL is capable of finding (near-) optimal (reorder) policies for MDPs. Furthermore, some simulation-based results and current research directions are presented.","['Economics', 'Health Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences/Technology', 'Economics, general', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Biotechnology', 'Economic Theory/Quantitative Economics/Mathematical Methods']"

Nowadays, gearing of this kind is commonly referred to as “Novikov/conformal” gearing. If properly designed, manufactured, and applied, Novikov gearing features a higher power density compared to that in conventional involute gearing of a similar size. Therefore, usage of Novikov gearing allows for transmitting more power by means of gearboxes of a smaller size. An increase of the power density is one of the strategic trends of evolution in the gear industry. A brief historical overview of Novikov gearing is presented in this chapter. It is shown that Novikov gearing is a reduced case of involute gearing. The concept of the “boundary Novikov circle” (introduced by the author and referred to as the “boundary N − circle,” for simplicity) enables clear analysis of the geometry and kinematics of Novikov gearing. The necessary and sufficient conditions for perfect operation of conformal gearing (that is, Novikov gearing) and high-conformal gearing are outlined. Use of the concept of “reversibly enveloping surfaces” (or just R e − surfaces, for simplicity) makes it possible to state that neither Novikov gearing or (more generally) nor high-conformal gearing can be finish-machined in a continuous indexing machining process; that is, the gears cannot be finish cut by hobs, shapers and rack cutters, or a worm grinding wheel, and so forth.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Energy Systems', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Complexity']"

The proposed method is based on sensor fusion from conventional and computer vision-based acceleration measurements. Three commonly used damage measures are presented and employed: mode shape curvature method, modal strain energy method, and modal flexibility method. The accuracy of these algorithms with the conventional structural health monitoring approach is demonstrated in a numerical case study, where damage scenarios are simulated on a simply-supported bridge. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed hybrid health monitoring methodology are demonstrated in a case study where the conventional acceleration measurements fail to detect and locate the damage.

Based on the Navier–Stokes equation, a high-precision analysis method of aerodynamic characteristics under compound deflected LEF/TEF is established. Through a numerical analysis, variations of the aerodynamic characteristics under different LEF/TEF deflection states are studied and the effects of compound flap deflections on the leading-edge vortex and shock wave in 2-D and 3-D cases are investigated thoroughly. The results indicate that the LEF deflects downward and the range of the leading-edge vortex decreases; the pressure distribution on the leading edge of airfoil with differently deflected TEF is nearly identical at a large Mach number. The effect of the compound deflected LEF/TEF on the aerodynamic characteristics is approximately equivalent to the superposition of the separate deflection effects of the LEF/TEF.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

This has the advantage that combinatorial explosion which is a nuisance is suppressed at every stage.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-18461-1_46,en,Towards Profitability: A Profit-Sensitive Multinomial Logistic Regression for Credit Scoring in Peer-to-Peer Lending,OriginalPaper,"This paper proposes a profit-sensitive learning method for loan evaluation in the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending market that could provide better investment suggestions for the lenders. Currently, the most widely utilized loan evaluation method is credit scoring, which focuses on evaluating the loans’ defaulting risk and formulates a binary classification problem. It screens out the non-default loans from the default ones and thus defines the best loans as those with a low probability of default (PD). However, the conventional credit scoring totally ignores the profit information while solely focusing on the risk. To address the above issue, we propose a profit-sensitive multinomial logistic regression model that incorporates the profit information into the credit scoring approach. More specifically, we first transform the binary classification problem in traditional credit scoring to a multi-level classification task by further dividing the default loans into two sub-classes: “default and profitable” and “default and not profitable”. Then we design a multinomial logistic regression model with a novel loss function to solve the above-defined multi-level classification task. The loss function weights loans differently according to their varying profits as well as their occurrence frequencies in the real-world practices. The effectiveness of the proposed method is examined by the real-world P2P data from Lending Club. Results indicate our approach outperforms the existing credit scoring only approach in terms of identifying more profitable loans while ensuring the low risk. Therefore, the proposed profit-sensitive learning method serves as an innovative reference when making investment suggestions in P2P lending or similar markets.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Assessing the actual and accurate 3D form and extent of interior defects is a complicated and also cumbersome task, unexpectedly with the developments in NDE techniques. Unlike the majority of traditional methods based on specialized forms of surface-penetrating waves or radiation imaging, this research uses optical cameras for full-field sensing of surface strains and deformations using the 3D-DIC technique as the basis for damage identification. This data-rich representation of behavior of the structural component is then leveraged in an inverse mechanical problem to reconstruct the underlying subsurface abnormalities. The inverse problem is solved through a topology optimization formulation that iteratively adjusts a fine-tuned FEM of the structure to infer abnormalities within the structure. Recently illustrated the feasibility of detecting and reconstructing the existence of 3D defects within small-scale structural components such as coupons using the proposed idea, this work focuses on expanding on the work by the authors to reveal that the proposed idea can be employed on large-scale structural components using the rich data from full-field image-based measurements to enable the identification of a more detailed picture of the internal defects. Thus, the goal of this research is to demonstrate the practicability and investigate the performance of the previously proposed method through an experimental program in which a set of large-scale structural components such as steel beams with and without buried defects are tested with full-field DIC sensing. A corresponding set of research steps with an increasing level of sophistication are designed to assess the capability of the approach to estimate steel material properties then to extent to infer the 3D shape of embedded defects.

Methods We identified gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit delta as a candidate therapeutic target by differential transcriptome analysis of metastatic GC tissue and adjacent nontumor tissues. GABRD mRNA levels were analyzed in 230 pairs of gastric tissue by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. GABRD function was assessed in proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis assays in human GC cell lines expressing control or GABRD -targeting small interfering RNA (siRNA). Mouse anti-human polyclonal GABRD antibodies were generated and assessed for inhibition of GC cell growth in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model of peritoneal GC dissemination. Results High GABRD mRNA expression level in primary human GC tissue was associated with poor prognosis. Expression of si GABRD in GC cell lines significantly decreased cell proliferation and invasion and increased apoptosis compared with control siRNA expression. Anti-GABRD polyclonal antibodies inhibited GC cell proliferation in vitro and decreased peritoneal tumor nodule size in the mouse xenograft model.

The RC elevated liquid storage tank is modeled as a multi-degree freedom system for the staging with a two-mass model for the container with liquid. Two control systems, viz., open-loop and closed-loop control systems are considered. The control algorithms employed are (1) Passive-OFF, (2) Passive-ON, (3) Clipped-Optimal Control (COC), and (4) Simple Semi-active Control (SSC). The study is also focused on the effect of change of voltage on the response quantities. For the COC algorithm, the feedback gain is obtained by considering velocity feedback. The present study proposes a SSC algorithm which is an effective way of controlling the response of RC elevated tank, which uses the ratio of the damper force and capacity of the damper. For numerical simulation, a code is developed in MATLAB. The coupled differential equations of motion for the system are solved using the state-space method. The response of the broad and slender tanks is studied by taking the ratio of the height of the liquid to the radius of the container ( S ) as 0.5 and 2.0, respectively. The controlled response of the tank under eight different ground motions comprising of near-field and far-field components of earthquakes is evaluated and compared with that of the uncontrolled response. Base shear, displacement, and damper force are obtained. The results showed that the structural response is effectively controlled using semi-active MR dampers with the proposed SSC strategy. The simple semi-active control algorithm proposed in this study could be considered as a proficient algorithm for the seismic response reduction of RC elevated liquid storage tanks using SAMRD.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Construction Management', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering']"

The solution is the output of a neural network with one hidden layer and linearly and nonlinearly adjustable input parameters (weights) during training. Network training is considered as a multi-criteria optimization problem solved by constructing a Pareto front and then choosing the optimal solution in some sense. An evolutionary algorithm for constructing solutions based on the Pareto front is proposed. The method is tested on two reference problems: the Laplace equation in the unit square with a discontinuous Dirichlet boundary condition (Motz’s problem) and without initial conditions, using measurement data of varying accuracy. Optimal solutions were obtained in accordance with two different selection criteria.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Neurosciences']"

In PolSAR image classification tasks, some algorithms often obtain different polarimetric scattering features by different target decomposition methods which can generate feature redundant. To solve the problems of complex processing and excessive time consumption caused by multiple dimensional features, a deep feature-based PolSAR image classification algorithm is given in this paper. The algorithm first extracts the original feature set from the PolSAR image which is used to pre-train the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) model. The redundant features in the original feature set are rejected according to the error which is calculated by the reconstruction error of the input features. The RBM network is initialized by the remaining features and corresponding weights, then train the Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM). Finally, the softmax classifier is trained with the training samples containing the deep features to achieve image classification. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has good feature selection timeliness and the deep features obtained from the algorithm can improve the image classification accuracy.","['Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Computer Applications', 'Geography, general', 'Earth System Sciences']"

The developed methodology is formulated on the assumption of nonstationarity of the cryosphere, especially during the transitional periods of the year. With the use of field observations and mathematical modeling, regularities of changes in temperature fields when using freezing devices have been established. The features of thermal interaction of underground sections of geotechnical structures with soils, caused by temperature changes in the surface layer, were revealed. The work considers engineering structures and the geological environment interacting with them, namely, the soil mass on which the thermal and mechanical influence of the foundation of the engineering structure extends. The object of research is the temperature distribution in the area of operation of cooling devices (thermal stabilizers). The authors analyzed the temperature field distribution models in the area of operation of seasonal cooling devices, taking into account phase transitions by the enthalpy method for one and two cooling devices. The situations of joint cooling by thermostabilizing installations of a geotechnical well were studied using the enthalpy form of the Stefan problem.","['Energy', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Environmental Management', 'Geography, general']"

The unknown parameters of thin-walled cross-section are defined as a function of section properties that represent warping behavior along the beam axis. Thin-walled structures are widely used in various structural engineering applications due to their advantage of high bearing strength when compared to self-weight and when subjected to combined loadings. When a thin-walled section is subjected to a combined load with restrained torsion, they are ineffective at resisting, and it leads to reduce the capacity of the beam due to the torsion and additional warping stresses. A finite element calculation can be used to analyze a 3D bar of thin-walled structural sections. Different commercial software and studies commonly consider six degrees of freedom at each node of a member for a space frame without considering the effect of warping restraint at the member's ends. This paper presents a finite element calculation for thin-walled sections with restrained torsion using the 14 × 14 member stiffness matrix, which includes warping as an additional degree of freedom and is commonly used for open thin-walled sections. In this study, we considered two different methods to take into consideration the additional degree of freedom for the stiffness matrix, which are very close to each other for small values of characteristics number.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Construction Management', 'Sustainable Development', 'Regional/Spatial Science']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-17453-7_12,en,Effect of Crystal Size on the Failure Mechanics of Polymer-Bonded Explosives,OriginalPaper,"Polymer-bonded explosives (PBXs) contain explosive crystals bonded together by a polymeric binder and are widely used in extreme loading conditions such as rocket propellants and explosive munitions because of their high performance and low sensitivity. PBXs typically constitute 80–95% of energetic crystals and 5–20% of a soft polymer binder. The particle size of crystals has a significant effect on the mechanical properties of most polymer particulate composites. In this paper, the effect of particle size on the deformation behavior of PBX under dynamic loading is investigated. This study involves testing polymer-bonded sugar (PBS) samples, a well-known mechanical simulant of PBXs, with four different crystal sizes – coarse, intermediate, fine, and superfine – with corresponding crystal sizes of 600–850 μm, 425–600 μm, 212–425 μm, and 100–212 μm, respectively. A dynamic compression load is applied to these samples using a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB). The macroscale and local dynamic deformation of the samples are captured by taking a series of images of the samples as they deform using a high-speed camera. From the macroscale experiment, it was observed that as the crystal size increases from superfine crystal size to coarse crystal size, the ultimate compressive stress of the PBS decreases. The mesoscale experiment shows that the local von Mises strain field of PBS for different crystal size specimens is different. The von Mises strain field in higher crystal size specimens such as coarse crystal size specimens is highly localized in the polymer-rich regions while more dispersed across the specimens with lower crystal size, particularly superfine crystal size. This study would give an in-depth knowledge and understanding of how the crystal size affects the deformation mechanics of energetic and other particulate polymer composites.","['Engineering', 'Complexity', 'Materials Science, general', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Structural Materials']"

Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is one of the ECs that traces (in ppb to ppt) have been found in surface water due to its persistence in environment and its insufficient removal at the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), such as UV/H 2 O 2 system, have been recognized as an effective technology to remove recalcitrant ECs. However, there have been very few studies, which followed the formation of AOP by-products and there is still much uncertainty over AOP by-products’ identification. In current study, the SMX removal by UV/H 2 O 2 AOP was investigated including identification, controlling and mitigation of SMX by-products. The results showed 99.99% removal of SMX in deionized (DI) water within 30 min. Major SMX by-products, identified by LC-MS-MS analysis, revealed longer lifetime and higher stability than SMX parent ion removed from the water matrix. The influence of technological parameters (oxidant’s dose, exposure time, pH and aeration rate) on the SMX removal and mitigation of BPs were imminent, in which the maximum SMX removal was achieved, while BPs were controlled and minimized in optimal conditions.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

The authors have developed approaches to the problem of finding anomalies on the conveyor line. The developed approach uses neural networks. Tissue defect detection is a quality control process that aims to identify defects and determine their location. An important task is also to detect the location of defective areas. This process allows for the precise identification of defective areas and avoidance of them entering the finished product, which is of great importance for textile manufacturers. The ability to accurately pinpoint defect points to support a fabric quality control process is the primary goal of an automated patterned fabric defect detection and classification system. This should be achieved at the expense of good processing speed, less computational complexity, and less computation time. Thus, the designed systems require reliable and efficient algorithms for detecting defects. Although various types of defects have been mentioned in the literature, only a few of them have been mentioned in the case of the transportation of textiles along the conveyor. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to present personal experience of applying various approaches to detecting defects on the conveyor using technical vision and machine learning technologies.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

The switching criterion decides the switching timing so that the control allocation is robust for the delay of fault detection and isolation module. Numerical simulation demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively perform actuator-fault tolerant position control of the hexacopter without actuator saturation and consume less control effort compared with existing one-stage control allocation algorithms.","['Engineering', 'Aerospace Technology and Astronautics', 'Engine Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

The paper’s objective is to construct a mathematical model of the temperature field of an long-length products (infinite cylinder, wire, filament) during 3D printing. For the first time, a mathematical model of the temperature field of an infinite cylinder with a constantly or periodically operating moving heat source has been constructed. Unlike existing models, the resulting model allows you to analyze the temperature field in the heating zone of the cylinder (wire, filament) before and after the heating zone. This becomes possible due to the introduction of a moving coordinate system and the involvement in the mathematical model of special functions. This model allows you to describe the temperature distributions during 3D printing of products and during heat treatment of moving wire (filament).

The fluid–fluid interface of partially filled containers during the sloshing phenomena can sustain only progressive or standing modes. Studies focussed on determining the supremacy of progressive waves during sloshing have been reported earlier and not on standing waves. Based on the analogy with gravity waves and principles of water wave mechanics, this study characterises the standing waves accountable for sloshing phenomena. This theoretical study utilises the linear stability analysis for tracking the disturbances at the liquid–air interfaces, subsequently determines the temporal growth rate, dominant wavenumber, and the corresponding sloshing frequency for both instability modes. For the practicality of the analytical model, the test liquids range from common fluids to industrial relevance transported in the containers. The analysis involves subjecting the liquid–liquid interface to standing wave disturbances of the wavelength 0.03–0.3 rad/cm, satisfying deep water assumption, and determining the influence of thermo-physical properties on the sloshing rate. The effect of surface tension is to escalate the growth rate at tested time intervals. Contrary, the viscosity suppresses the growth of disturbances dominating the inherent surface tension in the case of milk and liquid oxygen. The results highlight the dominance of standing wave and its subsequent harmonics over progressive wave for the tested fluids and chosen wave number contradicting earlier research outcomes portraying the supremacy of progressive waves.","['Energy', 'Energy Systems', 'Energy Storage', 'Renewable and Green Energy']"

Understanding the characteristics of these dividing flows can help engineers to make decisions on flood risk reductions. In this study, a numerical model has been applied for idealised Y-shaped channels in both cross-sections of rectangular and trapezoidal. InfoWorks ICM software is used to run the numerical analysis on the proposed model. The model included the main channel upstream with a bifurcated angle of 45° at each downstream channel. A series of simulations have been carried out to investigate the effects of various flow characteristics on the water depths and flow velocities. These characteristics are manning’s roughness coefficient, the width of the channel, and the shape of the channel cross-section. Results show that the increase in manning’s roughness coefficients caused a decrease in flow velocities and increased the water depths for both rectangular and trapezoidal cross-sections. Furthermore, increases in channel widths have caused decreases in flow velocities and water depths for both rectangular and trapezoidal cross-sections. In addition, the rectangular cross-section showed lower flow velocities and water depths compared to the trapezoidal cross-section. The findings from this study may provide a good understanding of the flow characteristics in a bifurcation river to mitigate floods.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Water, general', 'Pollution, general']"

The data structure describes the topology of the subdivision surface control polygon. The proposed method is then applied to a case study based on the hydraulic manifold applications. The possibility of building custom internal channels is exploited, with the advantage of obtaining smooth surfaces at the direction changes, with lower pressure drops, and a lightweight component due to the lattice structure that surrounds the channels.

Using their work, this research created a cellular automaton landslide model from a discrete Burgers’ Equation that offers a less computationally intensive model.

The objectives include: the hit probability of each defender, the miss distance of each defender, the final speed of each defender, and the distance between the aircraft and the attacker when the attacker is intercepted. These objectives are various and can be calculated based on the given flight states. Machine learning algorithms are used to predict these objectives so that the computational runtime is improved.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-15928-2_84,en,A Design Methodology for Graded Density Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces,OriginalPaper,"Functionally Graded Cellular Materials (FGCM), characterized by a gradual change in their properties, have previously reported better mechanical responses than their uniform counterparts. One particular example of FGCM corresponds to the application of a gradient in the density. In this context, the use of variable volume fraction cells can further improve the generation of lightweight internal structures for additive manufacturing. Accordingly, this study considers the implementation of Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces (TPMS) as elements for cellular constructs, given their advantages compared to traditional CAD lattices. Even though previous efforts in the literature have explored the generation of models with variable density TPMS, a modelling procedure has not been formally defined. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to propose a general design methodology for the development of graded density Primitive and Gyroid surfaces, which are common examples of TPMS, while considering a variation of the unit-cells’ design parameters, i.e. the pattern thickness and unit-cell length. The desired parameter variation is then used for the generation of the TPMS constructs by a manipulation of the TPMS function variables or the meshing process, inside a pre-defined design space. The differences in surface generation depending on TPMS type and input design parameters are presented and discussed, along perspectives for the process’s improvement. Ultimately, graded density TPMS can be developed in combination with topological optimization procedures of penalization algorithms for intermediate densities, while accounting for manufacturability restrictions.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Computer-Aided Engineering (CAD, CAE) and Design']"

Although adhesive joints are important for modern manufacture, little information about adhesive joints with hyperelastic adhesives exists. The single-lap joints (SLJ) with composite substrates are amongst the most studied. Furthermore, modelling hyperelastic behaviour as elastic-plastic leads to under-predict joint strength, for example, numerical analyses of joints bonded with the SikaForce ®  7752 show this effect. This adhesive and the Araldite ®  2015 are found in numerous analyses in the literature, and both adhesives show a hyperelastic behaviour corresponding to an Ogden type ( $$N=3$$ ). This work aims to evaluate the difference in the joint’s mechanical behaviour due to the chosen behaviour for the adhesive layer. SLJs with four different overlaps were evaluated where the two adhesives already mentioned were considered as elastic-plastic and later as hyperelastic. Subsequently, the stress distributions were compared between the two cases, whilst the modelling was done using FEM and compared with experimental data. The hyperelastic models showed larger joint compliance and less element distortion than their elastic-plastic counterparts, whilst their force-displacement curves resembled the experimental ones. Stress distributions obtained with hyperelastic models are similar to those from linear-elastic cases.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering', 'Solid Mechanics', 'Inorganic Chemistry', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Physical Chemistry']"

Since real-world cases are complex and computationally challenging systems that require effective optimization techniques, therefore recently, approximate resolution methods, specifically metaheuristics frameworks are in focus. In this research, we investigate a specific variant of Network Design Problems (NDPs), namely the Generalized Discrete Cost Multicommodity Network Design Problem (GDCMNDP), which seeks to find a network that optimizes the total costs while fulfilling several design restrictions. A promising newly developed solution approach based on the Archimedes Optimization Algorithm (AOA) that has not been tackled in the previous studies for solving NDPs is proposed. To assess its performance, the proposed approach is applied to benchmark network scenarios from the literature.

Several works have been established on this topic by taking into account the uncertainty of uncertain parameters. In this work, a study is reported on the stability within the intermediary axis of a double-stage gearbox considering the effect of the uncertainty design parameters. The incorporation of the uncertainty into the equation of motion of the system to establish the dynamic displacement behavior is performed for a model with 12 degrees of freedom, subject to excitations. The aim of this study is to better understand the impact of the interaction of two uncertain parameters on the dynamic behavior. The analysis started by raising the awareness of the system’s stiffness parameters independently of each other, to realize the influence of uncertainty of every parameter on the system. Then an exploration of the uncertainty under the effect of the interaction between these two parameters is performed on the dynamic displacement response. The numerical compilation of these results is carried out using the Polynomial Chaos sensitivity approach whose results were validated by the Monte Carlo deterministic one.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Materials Engineering', 'Classical and Continuum Physics']"

However, in the year 2019, there was an elevated scarcity of available surface water, which led to a drought-like situation. Thus, in this study, drought-affected areas are identified and simulated (for the year 2019) using the combined approach of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) tools and the weighted overlay method in the geographical information system (GIS) platform. For the study, seven key parameters were considered (rainfall, temperature, slope, drainage density, soil, land use/land cover, and groundwater yield). On a scale of one to nine, these parameters were assigned based on their degree of influence on drought. Then, using a pairwise comparison matrix and normalized weights from the AHP method, an overlay analysis (a weighted method on the scale of one to five) was performed. There were four drought classes (mild, moderate, severe, and extreme), and the percentage of drought-affected area in the region was 22.82% as mild, 60.10% as moderate, 16.16% as severe, and 0.92% as extreme. The simulated drought-affected regions were validated using collected ground data (State Government Department) and found that 43.71% of the area was mild drought and 51.32% was moderate drought, which shows that moderate drought regions are effectively modeled (error 8.78%) by the AHP method.","['Engineering', 'Civil Engineering', 'Environment, general', 'Sustainable Architecture/Green Buildings', 'Water, general']"

The numerical simulations are conducted using RANS-based modified k-ε concept, whereas the combustion is modeled using a steady laminar flamelet with β-probability density function with GRI 2.11 detailed chemical kinetics mechanism. The radiative heat loss is calculated using P-1 model along with the non-gray weighted sum of gray gases model (WSGGM), while soot is computed using the Moss-Brookes method. The numerical results show excellent compatibility with the experimental measurements. The validated model is further extended to analyze the various free stream turbulence intensities’ impact in the range of 5–40%. The study reveals that temperature distribution becomes more uniform due to increased oxidizer entrainment and enhanced fuel-oxidizer mixing. Besides this, the total soot volume fraction decreases with an increase in turbulent level. The study also provides a comparative analysis between WSGGM-based two radiative models.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer']"

However, technical and economic reasons may prevent the deployment of pervasive sensor networks over civil structures, thus limiting their reliability in terms of damage detection. Moreover, the effects of environmental (and operational) variability may lead to false alarms. To address these challenges, a multi-stage machine learning (ML) method is here proposed by exploiting autoregressive (AR) spectra as damage-sensitive features. The proposed method is framed as follows: (i) computing the distances between different sets of the AR spectra via the log-spectral distance (LSD), providing also the training and test datasets; (ii) removing the potential environmental variability by an auto-associative artificial neural network (AANN), to set normalized training and test datasets; (iii) running a statistical analysis via the Mahalanobis-squared distance (MSD) for early damage detection. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is assessed in the case of limited vibration data for the laboratory truss structure known as the Wooden Bridge. Comparative studies show that the AR spectrum is a reliable feature, sensitive to damage even in the presence of a limited number of sensors in the network; additionally, the multi-stage ML methodology succeeds in early detecting damage under environmental variability.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

The approach is based on coupled finite and boundary element methods involving hypersingular integral equations. Thin shells and plates are considered as structural elements interacting with ideal and incompressible liquids. The fundamental relations of the continuous mechanics are incorporated to describe the motion of structural elements and fluid. The fluid motion is supposed to be irrotational. The Laplace equation with respect to the liquid pressure on the wetted surfaces of the structural elements is obtained, and the corresponding boundary conditions for unilateral and bilateral contact of the structural element with the liquid are formulated. A hypersingular integral equation is obtained for bilateral contact of the structural element with liquid. The finite element method coupled with the boundary element method for the hypersingular integral equation is implemented to find the fluid pressure on the plate. The frequencies and modes of structure vibrations taking into account the added masses of the liquid are obtained. The accuracy and reliability of the proposed method are ascertained.","['Energy', 'Energy Systems', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Structural Materials', 'Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer']"

The aim of this paper is to employ the mathematical model to investigate the relationship between discharge, Froude number and bed width in the dividing open-channel flow. Several assumptions have been made and input values are taken from the literature to solve the proposed model. Results indicated that the highest discharge ratio is obtained when the dividing angle at channel 2 is $$30^\circ .$$ The discharge ratio slightly increases as the Froude number decreases for all angles. However, the Froude number of subcritical flows had a significant effect on the bed width ratio. For angles 30°, 45°, 60° and 75°, the discharge ratio decreases when the bed width ratio increases, but it remains unchanged when the angle is 90°. In conclusion, there is a linear relationship between discharges, Froude number and bed width ratio at certain dividing angles.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Water, general', 'Pollution, general']"

Perhaps most surprising is that convincing others of its importance rests with the case you make before the data are ever gathered. The importance of your hypotheses should be apparent before you test them. Are your predictions about things the profession cares about? Can you make them with a striking degree of precision?

The virtual interaction of people on the Internet makes it difficult to recognize the identity of a person. In addition, the open-network structure of the Internet might allow third parties to read and change data in a communication over the network. Hence, every organization must maintain the integrity of data by preventing unauthorized modification. To secure confidential information on the Internet, one must put into practice necessary security measures. Cryptography is a technique that helps to reduce security risks to the confidentiality and integrity of the data on the Internet. Moreover, the encryption of confidential data can be done either at the client machine (Web client) or on the server (Web server). The side (client/server) at which the encryption has to take place is decided based on the confidentiality of data to be protected. The critical data that need highest security in an organization is considered as in Level 1. In Level 2, we have information that is important but not critical as in Level 1. Level 3 comprises of data that are not important in the daily operations of an organization. Among the three levels of confidentiality, data exist at Level 1 and Level 2 need encryption so that they can be kept confidential on the Web. As the data in Level 1 is both confidential and important, it must be encrypted at the client-side itself before their migration onto the Web. Whereas, data in Level 2 can be encrypted after their migration since the criticality of data in Level 2 is less compared to that of Level 1. In this paper, the authors have identified some of the symmetric cryptographic algorithms with the help of which client-side encryption of data can be achieved for enforcing data privacy on the Web. They have also proposed an extended symmetric algorithm using which searchable encryption is possible on the encrypted data stored in a remote server.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Machine Learning']"

To address the challenges with high dimensional data in the medical area, this paper also provides a Forward Feature Selection (FFS) technique with Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) optimization.

After the signing of the Bologna Declaration in 2003 and three (re)accreditation processes, there remained a great difference between the education of class and pre-school teachers on the one hand, and subject teachers on the other. This chapter concludes that the education of future teachers face challenges and dilemmas, in particular, a lack of orientation towards teacher competences (in the education of subject teachers), discrepancies between teacher education programmes, and insufficient commitment to research.","['Education', 'Teaching and Teacher Education', 'International and Comparative Education', 'Professional & Vocational Education', 'Education, general']"

Failure rates and repair rates of the system are key elements of an automated system. In our method, we considered the fuzzy failure and fuzzy repair rates in the context of possibility. In this approach, a decomposition method is applied to a normal and convex fuzzy set. The decomposed fuzzy number gives a more efficient result in the context of possibility. Decomposition of membership grade generates the nested intervals for failure as well as repair rate and plays an efficient role in the estimation of posfust reliability in the automated systems. A reduced state space is used for the computation of availability with the concept of an equivalent transition rate. The whole process is compared with the existing technique and proposed technique with the help of a numerical example.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Statistics, general', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

It is therefore very important to be able to estimate the overall amount of live green vegetation in a given area. The most efficient way to provide such a global analysis is to use remote sensing, i.e., multi-spectral photos taken from satellites, drones, planes, etc. At present, one of the most efficient ways to detect, based on remote sensing data, how much live green vegetation an area contains is to compute the value of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation of why this particular index is efficient.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This disorder has to be identified at the beginning stage, or else this can damage the eyesight permanently. Since the fundus oculi are so easily visible, retinopathy is the most commonly recorded chronic complication of diabetes and, as a result, the one we know the most about in terms of epidemiology and natural history. Clinicians can use empirical but effective methods to postpone the initiation and development of diabetic retinopathy by achieving near-normal blood glucose and blood pressure levels. In order to identify this abnormality, ophthalmologists use the “fundus images” of the eye, that is retinal image to detect it. But to detect this abnormality through a naked eye, ophthalmologists find it difficult because it takes lot of time and consumes cost. Also, there might be misjudgement through a naked eye. So, “deep learning” can be used to detect the diabetic retinopathy at an early stage. There are many techniques of deep learning using “convolutional neural network (CNN)” to achieve the results of the level of eye damage. In this work, “Residual Networks” are also experimented to find out the results by improving accuracy.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Engineering Design', 'Machine Learning', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

The transformation of waves when passing through an elastoplastic granular layer with and without taking into account the change in the permeability of the layer due to its deformation is investigated. When solving problems, the dependence of the change in the permeability of a layer on its compression is used, which was obtained numerically when modeling the compression of symmetric fragments of granular layers in a spatial setting. A mathematical model is presented that describes in a one-dimensional approximation the interrelated processes of unsteady deformation of flat permeable granular layers, consisting of spherical particles, and wave processes in gas. The model is based on nonlinear equations of the dynamics of two interpenetrating continua. As the interphase forces, the drag forces are taken into account when the gas flows around the spherical particles and the Stokes friction forces.

In July 2008, the government of Qatar launched the long-term national strategy Qatar 2030 (QNV 2030), intending to transform Qatar into a knowledge-based economy capable of attaining sustainable development by 2030. Since then, the Qatari government has invested continually and implemented many policies to encourage innovation, entrepreneurship, the private sector, and the advancement of human capital competencies to turn the economy into a knowledge-based one. Indeed, entrepreneurship is a crucial engine for economic development, one of the essential engines of economic diversification and building a knowledge-based economy. Qatar has, therefore, made a significant determination to develop a flourishing entrepreneurial ecosystem, including establishing key institutions and organizations to support entrepreneurs, such as incubators and financial framework, as evidenced by the increasingly strong performances in key international indices published by multiple global organizations. Nevertheless, despite Qatar’s desire to diversify its economic base, entrepreneurs still have to contend with some challenges. Some of these difficulties are inextricably linked to Qatar’s features as a rentier state. This chapter aims to analyze the present state of the knowledge-based economy in Qatar with a focus on the entrepreneurial ecosystem. It has two objectives. Firstly, the chapter intends to investigate the features and recent development of Qatar's entrepreneurial ecosystem, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic.

The structures are delivered into space orbits in a folded, tightly packed transport state and after that the deployment takes place which occurs under the action of force actuators to bring them into a working position. Dimensions of the transformable space structures in transport and operating states can differ tens of times. The transformation of space structures occurs due to the use of various force actuators. In the process of opening such systems, dynamic shock loads occur on their elements. As active elements of force actuators, it is proposed to use materials with the shape memory effect. Some characteristics are obtained from quantitative and qualitative studies of wires made of titanium nickelide which have a shape memory effect.

To experiment and verify our approach, we chose the collection of sonnets Shakespeare wrote toward the end of his life. We look into current cognitive theories related to work of art and in particular to literary work, and we fix, as our target, all linguistic items that cause surprise or are unexpected formal expressions. From this we move onto linguistic theories and analyze the import of noncanonical syntactic structures, displacements, and discontinuities that contribute novelty and unpredictability as applied to a language like English which however did undergo substantial changes in its history. At this point we move onto Elizabethan times – the sixteenth century – when Early Modern English substituted Middle English and marked the entry in Modern English. Here we delve into the sonnets and trace all rhetorical and poetic devices used by Shakespeare to make every sonnet a surprise. We then compute thanks to SPARSAR – our system for poetry analysis and reading – different types of complexity measures that are then used to gauge the validity of the choice of what can be regarded as most “popular” sonnets, a list of 35 sonnets. This is confirmed by an accuracy of 89%. Eventually we produce an accurate reading of the popular sonnets using the TTS of Microsoft Speech Synthesis: the analysis of SPARSAR , represented in ssml code, takes care of all changes in pronunciation required by poetic constraints and Early Modern English.","['Mathematics', 'Mathematics in the Humanities and Social Sciences', 'Mathematics Education', 'Neurosciences', 'Philosophy of Mathematics', 'Mathematical Modeling and Industrial Mathematics', 'Mathematics in Music']"

It is proposed to investigate the data logged to build a profile of a legitimate user, and check in real-time whether his profile has changed dramatically. In case a critical deviation in the behavior of a legitimate user in an automated distributed environment has occurred, an alarm should be generated about a possible intrusion into the network by an intruder. Several approaches to solve the problem are considered. The first is a classical statistical method to construct a criterion for distinguishing random variables to detect deviation from standard user behavior using statistical models built on a class of strictly stable distributions. The second approach is based on numerical methods that use splines to approximate the observed value. The curves constructed with the help of third-order splines are selected as the boundaries of acceptable values of the estimated parameters for the legal user. The third approach is based without the methods developed for working with large-volume data and methods for clustering large-volume data, using a perceptron to find the boundary separating the legitimate user from the intruder. For all methods, the necessary number of observations required to build decisive rules of sufficient reliability is estimated.

In this paper, the steady magneto hydro dynamic flow between two porous plates is examined as a result of a magnetic field’s influence. The valves are inclined and the fluid flow is considered to be viscous and incompressible. Magneto hydrodynamics is a branch of study that deals with the movements of magnetic fields in electrically conducting fluids. The primary issue to be investigated is the structure of the solution where it experiences the inclined magnetic flow. This analysis is done by using similarity transformation. Increasing the fluid flow in inclined magnetic field keeps the reverse flow in control. Hartmann number is used to indicate the analytical expression of the fluid velocity. The magnetohydrodynamic channel flows play a vital role in the sector of engineering and technology such as MHD power generators. The problem is simplified to a third-order linear differential equation, from which the exact solution can be found.

As a result of research, traffic at intersections is controlled and managed by deploying advanced traffic signal control system (TSCS). Researchers from different parts of the world have proposed various solutions to design TSCS by applying cutting-edge technologies to reduce the waiting delay. In-turn, waiting delay plays an important role in optimizing the traffic signal configuration. But, estimating the waiting delay for an individual vehicle is difficult as vehicle arrival time at intersection cannot be predicted accurately. Even then, researchers across the world have proposed various delay estimation models which are suitable for various traffic conditions like uniform traffic structure, unstructured traffic, oversaturated traffic, under-saturated traffic, etc. But, reliability among most of the models is lacking which is illustrated in this paper. Four different models considered for the study, namely Webster, highway capacity manual (HCM), modified Webster and modified HCM. Two intersections, namely Townhall Circle and Shivakumara Swamiji Circle and from Tumakuru, one of tier-2 cities in Karnataka, India is selected as study area. Comparative analysis of the delay models used in the study is carried out with reference to actual delays observed. In continuation, delay models are also assessed by computing various types of errors. Results revealed that the Webster and modified HCM delay estimation method performed better over other two models. However, all four delay models used in this study are able to produce approximately correct results with 90% accuracy.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Wireless and Mobile Communication', 'Machine Learning']"

We can employ it to inform decision making processes based on ethical considerations, as a measure to ensure redundancy that helps us in avoiding system failure, as well as for verifying that autonomous systems remain trustworthy by testing for unwanted responsibility voids in advance. We follow recent proposals to use probabilities as the basis for responsibility ascription in uncertain environments rather than the deterministic causal views employed in much of the previous formal philosophical literature. Using an axiomatic approach we formally evaluate the qualities of (classes of) proposed responsibility functions. To this end, we decompose the computation of the responsibility a group carries for an outcome into the computation of values that we assign to its members for individual decisions leading to that outcome, paired with an appropriate aggregation function. Next, we discuss a number of intuitively desirable properties for each of these contributing functions. We find an incompatibility between axioms determining upper and lower bounds for the values assigned at the member level. Regarding the aggregation from member-level values to group-level responsibility we are able to axiomatically characterise one promising aggregation function. Finally, we present two maximally axiom compliant group-level responsibility measures – one respecting the lower bound axioms at the member level and one respecting the corresponding upper bound axioms.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In the last case, they have two complex conjugate intersecting points. We present their construction by tracing the circle with all lines. To visualize these points, the real plane is extended with the imaginary dimensions to four-dimensional real space. The surface generated by all complex points is orthogonally projected into two three-dimensional subspaces generated by both real and one of the imaginary dimensions. The same method is used to trace and visualize other real and imaginary conics and a cubic curve. Furthermore, we describe a graphical representation of complex lines in the four-dimensional space and discuss the elementary incidence properties of points and lines. This paper provides an accessible method of visualization of the complex number plane.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Computational Intelligence']"

It therefore generates an unsurpassable system of beings. Just as the One emerged from the emptiness of the abyss, so objects emerge from the One. These objects are structured by the simplest generative relation, namely, membership. Since the objects that participate in membership are classes, the One emanates rank after rank of ever more complex classes. The surpassable classes are the sets, and atheistic Platonists say the forms are set-theoretic structures. Acting through the quantifiers in that class theory than which none greater is logically possible, the One generates an unsurpassable totality of classes.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-17752-1_11,en,Atheistic Mysticism,OriginalPaper,"Eleven detailed cases of atheistic mystical experience are examined. Five themes emerge from these cases: structural insight, wholeness, extremity, ego dissolution, and valuable connection. I will use atheistic Platonism to interpret these five themes. Structural insight and wholeness correspond to that singular relational power that binds all things together into the wholeness of nature. This power is membership, and nature is the entire iterative hierarchy of classes. Mystical extremity is explained by the fact that the wholeness of nature is transcendental—it has the absolute infinity of a proper class. During ego dissolution, the mystic brain drops all its ontic encodings. It encodes only the existential quantifier in its orientation toward the Good. Valuable connection reveals that the singular relational power points from the One to the Good. Aligning with this orientation, the body of the atheistic mystic bears perfect witness to the Good.","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy of Religion', 'History of Philosophy']"

The developments in this research field were motivated by some failure cases in the 19th century. The structural failure occurred even if the loading stresses were below the yield point of the material. The reason for that were the elevated temperatures resulting in creep behaviour of the structure. The first theories have been formulated as uniaxial equations with only a few parameters. Later, these equations were extended to three-dimensional equations, substituting the scalar stress and strain by their tensorial counterparts. In addition, for better comparison to one-dimensional results, equivalent statements for the applied stresses were introduced. Up to now, there is no creep mechanics theory which is as strict as continuum mechanics. However, there are many engineering theories through which more and more solutions for practical cases can be obtained. Below, a state of the art report of creep and damage mechanics for metallic materials and structures composed from these materials is given. Some remarks concerning the equivalent stress statements are added. In the further chapters, some parts of this contribution are extended.","['Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Structural Materials', 'Classical and Continuum Physics']"

We discuss the present capabilities of the most recent release of DDE-BIFTOOL. They include the numerical continuation of steady states, periodic orbits and their bifurcations of codimension one, as well as the detection of certain bifurcations of codimension two and the calculation of their normal forms. Two longer case studies, of a conceptual DDE model for the El Niño phenomenon and of a prototypical scalar DDE with two state-dependent feedback terms, demonstrate what kind of insights can be obtained in this way.","['Engineering', 'Solid Mechanics', 'Complexity', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Functional Analysis']"

However, researchers have seldom questioned the basic assumptions underpinning the competency discourse and the ways of translating competencies into the curriculum. This chapter examines how twenty-first century competencies are recontextualized into educational aims and translated into the national curriculum in Singapore and, in so doing, questions the competency discourse and the way of translating competencies into the curriculum. It starts by describing how Singapore has responded to the challenges of globalization by introducing a set of educational and curricular initiatives and policies. It next examines how twenty-first century competencies are recontextualized into educational aims and translated into syllabus documents. Afterward, the chapter questions the basic assumptions underpinning the competency discourse and the “infusion strategy” for incorporating competencies into the curriculum. This is followed by introducing the basic tenets of Bildung -centered Didaktik and next by arguing that this theory provides an alternative, viable way of thinking about competencies and translating competencies into the curriculum. The chapter concludes by discussing what it means to bring this way of thinking into the conversation about twenty-first century competencies, curriculum making, and classroom teaching. The chapter can also be seen as an attempt to introduce Didaktik to Asian education communities. As such, it seeks to invite policymakers, curriculum developers, educators, and researchers to think beyond the current competency discourse and competency-based approaches to curriculum making, using curriculum and educational language as offered by Bildung -centered Didaktik . This theory foregrounds the importance of disciplinary-based content – rather than generic competencies – and of positioning students as subjects of their own rights for developing human powers (understanding, capabilities, dispositions).","['Education', 'International and Comparative Education', 'Education, general']"

The technical core of this work is how to make the best choice from the perspective of energy costs various related factors changing over time. Taking into account the network configurations that power houses and have different energy sources (such as photo-voltaic panels, batteries or the grid itself, etc.) and their constraints, as well as the energy cost objective function, we convert this grid modeling or energy configuration problem to an energy cost Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), in order to achieve simulation under different conditions. In addition, considering the complexity of the parameters for some inexperienced users, when establishing certain specific parameter configurations, we propose to use natural language to represent these parameters, so as to use fuzzy logic methods to deal with the ambiguity and imprecision related to these variables. The experimental simulates the difference while the family has its own fixed energy configuration and the case of the optimized the energy configuration according to the grid configuration.

They have primary importance in blast-related research. The pressure–time profile parameters, such as peak overpressure, positive time duration, and decay coefficient of the shockwave, depend on the shock tube parameters (STPs) such as driver length, driven length, and burst pressure. We can generate shockwaves with the desired pressure–time profile by effectively tuning the STP. This study experimentally investigates the effect of driver length on the pressure–time profile of a shockwave generated by a blastwave simulator. Increasing the driver length increases the positive phase duration and peak overpressure at all probe locations. Also, it increases Friedlander profile formation distance. Further, a finite element model for shock tube is developed in ABAQUS/Explicit and the numerical results are compared with the experimental observations. The developed numerical model can predict the observed pressure–time profile with reasonable accuracy, so that it can be used for further parametric studies in the design of blast wave simulators.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Building Materials', 'Structural Materials']"

This investigation is done numerically using ANSYS Fluent 15.0 package taking water as working fluid varying Reynolds number from 199.04 to 2009.9. A 2D single tube of semicircular shape under different orientations is simulated and compared with a circular shape. The direction of the semicircular tube changes to a different position to find the best-performed orientation. The results are validated with experimental data with good agreement. The fluid enters the bottom of the domain, strikes over the semicircular tube at different angles, and leaves at the top. The tube is heated at a constant temperature, and the Nusselt number is calculated. Temperature and velocity streamline contours are analyzed to study the flow pattern and streamline around the tube. With increasing the Reynolds number (Re), both Nusselt number (Nu) and pressure drop increase for all cases. It is found that the semicircular shape at 90°, orientation angle has a higher Nusselt number and lower pressure drop than other orientation and a circular shape.

The MD has high computational costs and is suitable only for small applications while the AFEM presents some difficulties of formulation and implementation because each atomic element matrix size depends on the neighbouring atoms and the boundary elements need a special processing. To overcome these difficulties, a standard finite element is formulated and used in the development of an Atomic-Scale Mesh-Free Method (ASMFM). This new optimized method is used to analyze the mechanical response of atomic structures to an external loading. To replace the classical meshing, all the atomic interactions of the structure are determined using a function that depends on the interatomic distances and the cut-off radius of Lennard Jones potential. For comparison raisons, only the covalent bonding structures are considered in the simulation. The method is applied to one- and two-dimensional atomic structures. Results show a low computational cost and an acceptable accuracy when compared with those of classical methods.

Therefore, the effective machine learning models to alleviate NVH is required. Although a huge amount of data is needed to construct the reliable models, the number of training data is very scarce in practice. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model combined with data augmentation methods (dropout and SpecAugment) that predicts interior noise levels from steering accelerometer signals when only a small number of training data is available. The effectiveness of the proposed framework was demonstrated using steering automobile accelerometer signals and noise levels from real automobiles.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

In contrast, the frequency-domain representation helps you to determine at which frequencies a signal potentially leads to radiated emissions.

In this connection, thin-walled square tubes have been extensively used as energy absorbers in automobile vehicles. In case of frontal crash accidents, these tubes are expected to collapse and absorb crash energy. If these tubes deform at very high crush forces, there is high risk and damage to the vehicle occupants. Hence, the design of such tubes is important with minimum peak crush force with an enhanced energy absorption capacity. Introducing thickness variation in thin-walled tubes is one of the techniques to minimize the initial peak crush force. In this research work, square tubes with linearly (LVST) and stepwise (SVST) varying wall thickness tubes were manufactured from commercially available AA6063 extruded tubes in the “M1TR” vertical milling machine with the help of slip gauges in providing gradients and steps. Subsequently, the crushing behaviors of LVST and SVST tubes were experimentally characterized and their initial peak crushing force (IPCF) and energy absorption (EA) were evaluated. It was found that variation in the wall thickness of tubes has a significant effect on their IPCF and EA. IPCF of LVST and SVST tubes were reduced by 24–67% and 30–71% respectively compared to uniform thickness (UT) tubes. At the same time, enhancement of SEA of about 6.84% was witnessed. The results evidenced that LVST and SVST tubes can improve the deformation behavior and be used as energy absorbers in place of uniform tubes in automotive fields.","['Materials Science', 'Structural Materials', 'Nanotechnology', 'Materials Science, general']"

Wrapping provides columns with confinement and increases their strength and performance. During the past decades, numerous researches have been performed on the characterization of concrete columns wrapped with FRPs. Therefore, a large experimental database is available that assists in determining the behavior of FRP-wrapped concrete columns. From the designer's point of view, both for analysis and for design, having failure criteria for FRP-wrapped concrete columns is crucial. There have been many proposed stress–strain models for concrete columns confined with FRPs. The majority of the proposed formulas were derived based on a statistic approach. Only a few formulas were derived based on mechanics-based methods such as plasticity-based approaches. The presence of a database, with almost 800 data points, on the behavior of FRP wrapped concrete columns with different FRP strength and modulus, thicknesses, number of layers, and diverse concrete properties was the motivation for conducting a research on developing new equations for the prediction of the confined concrete strength of circular concrete columns wrapped with FRPs.

Time-dependent flow is necessary to understand the properties of gas behind the shock. Effects of viscosity are neglected to reduce the computation times for highly non-uniform processes. For an inviscid flow, Navier–Stokes equation is reduced to the Euler equation. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique was used to correctly resolve and capture shock waves and contact surface.

This technology involves pumping stopping during the main hydraulic fracturing until the fracture closes and then resuming the pumping. Thus, a secondary fracture with a shift along the azimuthal angle is created, and the fracture network is redistributed: the increase in the coverage height changes to the fracture network branching along the lateral. This technology is not considered in the standard acid HF simulators, while the modification of commercial simulators is technically complicated and associated with increased costs. The proposed solution makes it possible to perform calculations using a standard simulator without its modification. The scientific novelty of the work consists in the correct and suitable for further analysis modeling of the acid fracturing with a technological stop and calculation of the properties of the created fractures using the standard HF simulator. For the first time, a technique has been developed which makes it possible to perform the calculations correctly, obtain a set of indicators, and compare them with that obtained during the standard acid fracturing.

According to the simulation using particles of varied sizes, the angle of repose is changed marginally with minor errors in the test of the angle of repose. Also, particle size has insignificant influence on the simulation results in the test of the angle of repose. That is to say, the simulation test of the angle of repose is less sensitive to the particle size. However, particle size exerts a remarkable influence on the simulation result in the vane shear test. Specifically, when the particle size is changed, then the maximum torque of the vane will be significantly fluctuated, indicating that the vane shear test is highly sensitive to the particle size.

The nonlinear kinematic hardening model (the Chaboch model) is implemented in the finite elements’ analysis for different kinds of blocks loading (low high)/ (high low). Moreover, the hysteresis loop for short and long cracks is discussed to analyze the cyclic plastic deformation. The finding results show that the residual stress zone increases with loading sequences increase and remains the same when high low blocks are applied. Besides, steeps jump in the hysteresis loop are appeared after the overload block for both short and long crack. The presence of the steeps jump is explained by the increase in the size of the residual stress zone in front of the crack tip.

The effect of competitor prices is realistically represented by a double-kinked price-response function. There is a monopolistic range within which price increases do not trigger large sales losses. However, if one exceeds the upper threshold, sales and most likely profits collapse sharply. Competitor price increases shift the price-response function, and hence the upper threshold, to the right.

However, their use in real applications is still challenging. Among the critical aspects that can compromise the effectiveness of such SHM systems in the identification of structural anomalies, the operating conditions (temperature, loads, vibration, corrosion, etc.) require a particular attention. Damage detection algorithms and methods are thought mainly by referring to lower Technology Readiness Levels, typical of laboratory conditions where real scenarios cannot be easily reproduced. For this purpose, the Finite Element (FE) models find a key role for the understanding of the physics of governing phenomena driving the GW also in scenarios closer to the real one. In this paper, an experimentally validated FE model has been used to investigate on the effects of GW propagation mechanisms in a composite plate at 65 ℃. The effects of this in-service temperature have been highlighted by comparing GW dispersive behavior as well as polar plots with respect to the room temperature (20 ℃).

Among all renewable energies, the solar energy is one of the biggest and eco-friendly energy generators to the world. However, since many years solar energy is being used but not in a complete effective way. The Photovoltaic Solar Systems (PSS) suffer from insufficient sunrays due to the orientation angle i.e., the sunrays are not able to be acquired by the solar panel after a certain period of time because, the solar panel is fixed in one direction and it cannot be moved as the sun rotates, due to which maximum utilization of energy does not occur. To overcome this challenge, a solar tracker has been designed which tracks the exact polar co-ordinates using the existing data and instructs the solar panel to rotate in the direction of sunlight so that the maximum energy can generate the electricity. Moreover, the Maximum Power Tracking (MPT) controller has been used to achieve the maximum energy storage without wasting the generated energy from the solar panel.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Together they can launch satellites to suborbital space. Rockoon's concepts were abandoned due to their inaccuracy. With an increase in nanosatellite development, there is an increase in affordable launches desire. This paper aims to discuss altitude stabilization and trajectory control techniques for an enhanced flight of high-altitude balloons. This paper's Stabilization techniques include Stratosail Balloon Guidance system, Dual Balloon System, Electrohydrodynamic Propulsion, and Cold Gas Propulsion system. Stratosail provides stability using the wing and rudder suspended at 10–15 km below the primary balloon. A dual balloon system provides stability by pumping in or venting out the atmospheric air to change the altitudes. It helps restrict trajectory within 25 km. Electrohydrodynamic thrusters ionize the surrounding air to produce thrust and propel the system in the desired path. The cold gas propulsion system provides a yaw moment for trajectory control. Using these techniques, a better flight of high-altitude balloons is expected, the stability helps in the proper launch of the rocket from the high-altitude platform. This paper provides a detailed literature review of these concepts. There is much future scope in the research field of stabilization and Trajectory Control of High-altitude balloons for Rockoons.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Computer-Aided Engineering (CAD, CAE) and Design', 'Materials Engineering']"

The cohesive soils have the expansive and shrunk nature. The settlement of the structures is occurred due to poor bearing capacity of soil. The expansive soils or black cotton soils are treated by grouting and stabilization methods. The admixtures, waste materials, and chemicals are used to treat the soil and improve the mechanical properties of soil. As per the requirement, various methods are introduced to stabilize the soil. Chemical stabilization is one of them. In this review article, the comparative study of performance evaluation of soil using chemical stabilizer is summarized. A summary is composed on the investigation of various mechanical properties, namely Atterberg’s limit, standard proctor test, and California Bearing Ratio test. Furthermore, the effect of chemical on the mechanical properties of the soil was evaluated, and it was found that the swelling properties was controlled, and the bearing capacity of soil was increased for expansive soils by adding the minimum quantity of chemical admixture.

Due to the possibilities of treating tumors >3 cm in a shorter time with greater efficacy, MA has been proved as an alternative to RFA for treating cancerous tumors. The efficacy of MA can be determined by the output Ablation Zone generated to ablate the tumor from the targeted region. Thermal therapies highly depend on the tissue properties to successfully ablate the tumor from the targeted region. Tissue physical properties like Blood Perfusion Rate, Thermal, and Electrical Conductivity potentially affect the heat generation and the energy deposition over the tissue resulting in shorter ablation zones. Therefore, to understand the role of tissue properties like Blood Perfusion Rate, Thermal, and Electrical Conductivities, a finite element-based numerical study has been made to analyze the individual impact of these tissue properties on the Ablation Volume attained during the MA on lungs. It has been found that the higher values of Electrical Conductivity play a positive role during the treatment process as higher Electrical Conductivity results in larger ablation zones. Alternatively, the other tissue properties like the Blood Perfusion Rate (BPR), and the Thermal Conductivity have a negative correlation with the ablation volume, signifying a tissue with a higher rate of Blood Perfusion and Thermal Conductivity would make it difficult to generate an intense temperature profile, hence, leading to small ablation zones. The results obtained from the study clear out the individual impact of tissue properties during the Microwave Ablation. Understanding the effect of tissue properties would help clinical practitioners to adjust the optimal settings required for the MA to ablate the tumor in a short period without damaging the healthy tissue.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Robotics and Automation']"

Because of its corrosion resistance, ductility, and good electrical conductivity, aluminium is one of the most often utilized lightweight materials in engineering industries. Because of its soft nature, aluminium is inefficient in situations when thermal loads are large. Metal matrix composites (MMCs), a novel class of engineered materials that uses aluminium alloys as a matrix, are being developed to overcome this issue. In this study, the volume fraction of reinforcement (ZrB 2 ) and properties of both LM26 aluminium alloy as well as its composites were used to create models (matrix and composites) to analyze the compressive behaviour. A total of four LM26/ZrB 2 composites containing varying percentages of reinforcement (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 wt%) were modelled using CAD modelling software. Compressive strength analysis was carried out using finite element analysis software (ANSYS R15.0) to determine the mechanical properties of the matrix and composite models such as von Mises stress, equivalent elastic strain, and total deformation.

The process of changing the physical, chemical, and biological property of a natural soil, in order to improve their tensile strength, bearing capacity and overall performance, by using controlled compaction, proportioning, in addition of suitable stabilizer and admixture, is known as stabilization of soil. The major application of soil stabilization is in the field of pavement set up over a weak subgrade soil. It is very much essential to improve its strength, bearing capacity, and performance to a level higher than the existing condition. By modifying the subgrade soil properties, economy can be achieved in pavement construction by having reduced upper crust thickness. The main objective of this work is to have an economical pavement design. In this study, the type of soil used is silty sand (SM), and for stabilization of soil, TerraZyme was used. After stabilizing the soil by using TerraZyme, there was a marked improvement in compaction property, California bearing ratio (CBR) value, unconfined compressive strength (UCS) value, cohesion value, and angle of intersection.

Basically, cancer can arise in any tissue of the body, and while each variety of cancer has unique characteristics, the fundamental processes that might cause cancer are highly common in all disease types. Breast cancer is one of the most ubiquitous types of cancer in females. In males, prostate cancer is the most dangerous during recent years. This study focuses on breast cancer as well as on prostate cancer in the direction of their early predictions. For early prediction, eight classification models had been used such as logistic regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), decision tree (DT), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). This work includes three different datasets for research analysis of breast and prostate cancer predictions. Two datasets for breast cancer (Coimbra and Wisconsin) and one for prostate cancer are taken from UCI and Kaggle repository, respectively. For improving the results of prediction, the normalization technique and feature selection method had been used in this paper. Performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and curves of each classifier are analyzed in this study. Most of the classifiers did well after using the feature selection method (ANOVA). In the case of Breast Cancer Coimbra, KNN give good results with 80% accuracy in both the cases with or without using feature selection. Logistic regression with feature selection doing the best work on Wisconsin Breast Cancer with 99% accuracy. There are four classifiers (SVM, RF, DT, and SGD) which gives highest accuracy (97%) on prostate cancer.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

But, most of these stent designs have their limitations and drawbacks, which have been studied. This paper reviews some existent stents and suggests where and why does the structure of the stent fail. The key mechanical integrity, related to stent designing, and its deployment have been considered as an objective and constraint function of this analysis. Like stresses on the stent, equivalent plastic strain PEEQ, recoil, and foreshortening of stent, artery too have stress development and foreshortening, since arterial cells also have some constraints in both the longitudinal and circumferential directional stretch. The cause of failure of five stents structures, reported in the literature, is suggested in this work. To reduce the computational time, a unit cell of the stent and cylindrical artery has taken for simulation. The finite element method is employed for the analysis of all mechanical behavior at various load conditions throughout the percutaneous coronary intervention PCI process, and the results are reported.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films', 'Energy Systems']"

Related scholars have also proposed many solutions, such as heuristic algorithm, neural network, genetic simulated annealing algorithm, improved genetic algorithm. But there are still deficiencies in welding torch posture, welding position, and robot motion stability. Because of the characteristics of the welding seam have a vital influence on the path planning of the welding robot, it is also the basis for ensuring the welding accuracy. From the perspective of graphic calculation, the graphical computing method of precise welds is analyzed, the point cloud graphics of the welded parts are used to calculate the overlap of primitives, and the accurate and rapid extraction of weld features are realized by changing the graphic representation of the welded parts model. According to the connection characteristics of the weldment, the characteristics of the weldment are collected, and a simple, fast, and more versatile method for extracting and calculating weld features is designed, and the weld features are discretized. Discrete weld feature points are used as the basis for path planning of the welding robot to carry out reasonable welding path planning, which reduces the manual teaching process and workload. Finally, a robot welding path planning method based on graphical computing is proposed, and corresponding simulation experiments are carried out.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Additionally such data frequently involves uncertainty, and this must be considered in the aggregation. Aggregation approaches ranging from possibilistic conditioning to probability and possibility transformations can be used to produce homogenous representations (probability or possibility) for aggregations. Here we review several approaches to uncertainty aggregation that apply to multi-criteria systems. Additionally, we consider approaches to evaluate the uncertainty of the aggregation to provide guidance of the use of the aggregated data for multi-criteria applications.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Optimization', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory']"

In this chapter, techniques are presented to enhance the FRW method for handling the structures with non-Manhattan conductors. Based on the aligned-box distances and corresponding calculating approaches, the techniques for generating the Gaussian surface and constructing axis-aligned transition cubes are presented. A practical strategy is then presented to judge the domination relationship of non-Manhattan conductor blocks for building the space management structure with candidate list. Finally, the strategy using rotated transition cube and related space management technique are presented to make further acceleration. Experiments on three-dimensional (3-D) interconnect structures including from eight to one thousand non-Manhattan blocks show that the developed method is from 2.9X to 96X faster than a simple extension of the original FRW method. The developed FRW solver is also up to 39X faster than a boundary element method based solver.

This design leads to a strong periodic variation of the stiffness (among other parameters) experienced by the vehicle. Also, along its route, the Hyperloop will encounter so-called transition zones (e.g., junctions, bridges, etc.), where the properties (e.g., support stiffness) are different than for the rest of the structure. In railway engineering, increased degradation is seen in the vicinity of these transition zones, leading to increased frequency of maintenance. This work investigates response amplification mechanisms in a Hyperloop system that arise due to the combination of a transition zone and the structure having a periodic nature. The amplification mechanisms investigated here can help prevent degradation of the Hyperloop tube close to transition zones as well as fatigue and wear of the vehicle.","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis']"

However, the situation was contradictory in IBIs, and the situation remained in a state of paradox, resulting in a severe shortage of qualified talent. Despite this, the number of graduates from Islamic banking education institutions and the number of graduates from Islamic banking institutions continues to grow year after year. As a result, who should be held accountable for this state of affairs in the talent pool? In order to determine the factors that were affecting the talent shortage in Malaysian Islamic banking institutions, the purpose of this study is to collect data from a variety of sources.

Depending on the complexity of the space and the task at hand, this can be a difficult challenge. Nevertheless, the finding of useful viewpoints can be facilitated, at least in virtual reality, by changing the layout of the space, as well as by changing other visual features to lower the cognitive load of navigation. In this paper, we present a set of experiments using the MaxWhere desktop virtual environment which suggest that besides the arrangement of a space, its key points of discovery can also influence the time it takes to accomplish a task. This conclusion is supported both by data on key points of navigation and on the activation mode that was utilized on the various smartboards (2D displays) laid out in 3D space.

For extracting precise vulnerability Vulnerability information to support flood remedial actions, a spatial vulnerability, risk, and susceptibility mapping technique including multi-criteria at the regional scale is required. This work provides a spatial multi-criteria-integrated method to flood vulnerability, risk, and susceptibility mapping using geospatial approaches at the regional scale. This suggested strategy was implemented in the Alipurduar district in West Bengal, India. Flood susceptibility, vulnerability Vulnerability , and flood risk assessment are the three components that were examined in this study. By integrating the susceptibility and vulnerability maps, the study created a flood risk map with 12 indicators for flood susceptibility and nine indicators for flood vulnerability. To facilitate the analytical hierarchy process Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) , the requirements were translated into weighted spatial layers and normalized. Individual susceptibility and a weighted overlay approach were used to build vulnerability Vulnerability component maps, which were then utilized to build final flood risk maps. The produced maps were effective in determining the geographic extents and levels of susceptibility. Results reviled that the riverside area is more susceptible and the southern part of the district is more prone to flooding because of its proximity to the active waterway and low elevation Elevation . This approach was validated by AUC Area under curve (AUC) curve analysis using flood inventory data which were collected from Google map, flood recorded data available in the district disaster management Disaster management handbook, and the Bhuvan web portal of ISRO. The results indicate that this method might be used to analyze the spatial variability of flood risk in flood vulnerable areas to build effective flood prevention plans and policies.","['Earth Sciences', 'Natural Hazards', 'Computer Applications', 'Geography, general', 'Water, general', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

Women in India are leaders of varied sectors of businesses and on top leadership positions except in IT companies. This study has found that 14 out of 25 leading IT companies in India has, got not more than two women on the board of directors. It has also been found that the reasons for said nomination are due to the statutory compulsion to have women on board. Information technology companies are responsible for innovation, business growth, transformation and diversification. Strategic leadership is the key for IT companies to achieve the above-stated objectives. Inclusiveness in the economic reforms is possible when women are given adequate representation in entrepreneurship Entrepreneurship and leadership positions in all sectors of industries. This study aims at examining the causes of the inadequate representation of women in Indian IT companies. Paper has examined the following issues to analyse the above-stated proposition: (a) How far the Indian IT industry has contributed to the empowerment of Indian women? (b) Whether the employment terms and recruitment policies of IT companies are sufficient to ensure the security of tenure and promotion to women employees and do it incentives women employees’ contribution towards innovation in their respective companies? (c) What are the factors contributing to women taking up leadership positions in Non-IT Industries? (d) Whether family commitments are the reasons for women in the IT sector to decline leadership positions or whether male domination is a cause for women to be backward in IT companies’ leadership positions? (e) Should mandatory reservation of adequate percentage of seats for women in administration be uniformly applied also for employment of women in the IT sector and how far the practice followed in developed jurisdictions need to be incorporated under the Indian law Law ? Enrolment of women in IT and business education is on par with their counterparts. Since women occupying leadership positions is negligible, the paper examines the challenges and proposes solutions to ensure gender equitable reforms in the leadership roles of Indian IT companies. Data related to board composition and shareholding patterns of Indian IT companies are looked into and analysed to identify whether women possess capital or management control in the Indian IT companies. To critique the role of women in other sectors of employment with that of the IT companies, data collected from the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) and Indian government-sponsored schemes are considered. The data are also collected from various sources such as Sustainability Sustainability Reports of Wipro, Infosys, HCL, Dell, Accenture, Tata, Human Development Index (HDI), United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA). The data compiled reflect the factors that affect women’s career progression in the Indian IT sector. This study has found that there is an absolute imbalance in terms of gender diversity on the boards of Indian IT companies. Reasons for the same are as follows: 1. Women who have excelled in technological education are not willing to take up leadership positions in IT companies due to the challenges and risks Risk involved in this specific sector, 2. Family commitments and health issues are not conducive for women to dedicate the required time in managing corporate boards of IT companies, 3. Joint families and a patriarchal Indian system limits woman to undertake employment, 4. Women with liberal outlook and merit are not preferred as a choice by male leaders of IT companies due to the fact that they never want to be led by women, 5. The upskilling programmes organized by IT companies to their women employees are not sufficiently focused to promote women to leadership positions and 6. Excess share qualification for directorship prescribed by listed public companies is an impediment for women to be considered for executive positions. Paper suggests strategies and policies for the promotion of women employees to executive positions and ensuring the disclosure of diversity of corporate boards as a prerequisite to listing its shares. Secondly, it proposes to amend Companies Act, 2013 to prescribe a higher number of mandatory appointments of women on board to make it mandatory for women to be part of committees of the board mandated under the Companies Act. Thirdly, it proposes that the B-Schools admission policies should increase the intake of women candidates for management programmes so that they would possess the adequate competency to govern corporate boards of Indian IT companies.","['Business and Management', 'Business and Management, general', 'Business Ethics', 'Sustainable Development', 'Corporate Governance']"

In 3-D ICs, the inter-tier-via (ITV) is a critical enabling technique because it forms vertical signal and power paths. Accordingly, it is imperative to accurately and efficiently extract the electrostatic capacitances of ITVs using field solvers. Unfortunately, the cylindrical via shape presents major challenges to most of the existing methods. To address this issue, we develop a novel floating random walk (FRW) method by rotating the transition cube to suit the cylindrical surface, devising a special space management technique, and proposing accelerating techniques for structures with large-sized through-silicon-vias (TSVs). Experiments on typical ITV structures suggest that the FRW algorithm enhanced with the presented techniques is up to hundreds times faster than a simple FRW approach and the boundary element method (BEM) based algorithms, without loss of accuracy. In addition, compared with extracting the square-approximation structures, the presented techniques can reduce the error by 10X.

The studied metamaterial configuration is a one-dimensional mass-spring chain system with $$N$$ N identical lumped masses and each lumped mass has two resonators attached. Each unit cell of metamaterial is considered as a 1-DoF system with the effective mass varying with the excitation frequency, which can be negative in specific ranges of excitation frequencies. With dual resonators, dispersion relation diagrams show that there will be two separate bandgaps in which vibration transmission is suppressed, the frequency ranges for the bandgaps are similar to those for negative effective mass. Wave transmittance and power flow analysis also provides new perspectives to evaluate the dynamic characteristics. The results indicate that the wave transmittance is low and the energy is blocked within the bandgaps. The bandwidths of two bandgaps will not be influenced by cell position and the power transmittance of high excitation frequency is decreased as position number increases. The effect of inertance change on bandgap characteristics is examined and it shows that when the other parameters are the same, the two bandgaps are merged into one complete wide bandgap with identical inertance. These findings can provide a better understating of the dynamic behavior of dual-resonator metamaterials and their optimal design .","['Engineering', 'Vibration, Dynamical Systems, Control', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis']"

Current research on the dynamic stability of structures are usually limited to harmonic loads, and the solution method is usually based on the Floquet’s theory. It is well known that loads on engineering structures are rarely harmonic, but arbitrary. These loads can be imposed on the structures by either human activities such as explosions and machine vibrations or natural phenomena such as earthquakes and hurricanes. This paper presents a method for the solution of second-order linear differential equations with periodic coefficients. In this approximation method, the elastic beam is considered as a continuous system with various simplifying assumptions under the sum of step functions, which is solved using a matrix method involving a set of chain of power of matrices. The governing dynamic equations of motion thus become a matrix or single differential equation being function of time only. The accuracy of the analysis is ensured by comparing the dynamic behaviour of an elastic beam obtained from this analysis with those obtained by other methods available in the previous studies of literature. Application examples are provided, and limitations of this approach are also discussed. The study provides an excellent theoretical knowledge to enhance the understanding of the dynamic stability of an elastic beam under axial arbitrary loads, which can be used to develop software and modify the relevant design codes.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']"

In a web-based learning system, search engines have been found applicable to continue the educational process. Also, the search engines are involved with retrieving necessary documentation (images, text, video, web pages, and so on) from a large database in order to respond to the learner’s request and several online platforms have been made with different features and facilities viz. Zoom, Google Meet, Google Classroom, Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex, GoTo Meet, skype, etc. In this chapter, we have been applied TOPSIS method for selecting suitable online platform from existing online platforms using Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique. Finally, to illustrate the proposed technique, a realistic scenario for selecting the online platform from a web-based learning system has been exhibited.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Optimization', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory']"

In this way, conceptions of learning and education are broadened to cover people’s knowledge building as life-deep, life-wide, and lifelong within broader community ecosystems. This educational imperative is global in scope. The first part of the chapter focuses on the increased connectivity and platformization of young people’s contemporary lives. Another part refers to the relevant aspects of a learning lives approach, which has also triggered methodological innovations regarding the ways of using digital technologies in collecting and analyzing data. The discussion will refer to some snapshots of empirical data from projects during the past decade to exemplify learning lives in transition and why this is an important educational imperative in contemporary societies. Implications will be drawn for in-service and preservice teacher education, as well as for further research orientations. The aim is to achieve a deeper understanding of learners and their learning in contemporary societies beyond the context of formal learning in the classroom.","['Education', 'International and Comparative Education', 'Education, general']"

Implicit curves are proving to be a powerful yet underused tool. The methodology we propose not only allows a more relevant visualization of information, but also a faster and efficient access to it: (1) since curves are extracted and compressed during precomputation, real-time rendering is possible on the end-user’s computer, even for very large datasets; (2) this property can be extended by enabling real-time data access and transfer at the server level – i.e. simultaneously saving local storage costs and increasing raw data security. Our proposal also achieved a high compression ratio (3%) while maintaining the visual significance of the data and reducing discrete artifacts such as curve gaps and pixel aliasing. We based our tests using two-dimensional height maps, but extending it to more dimensions is not a problem since we can consider any two-dimensional slice in these data.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Computational Intelligence']"

Observation involves the sensing of data. Visualisation renders data tractable to the specific sense of vision. There is no visualisation without observation, and some observation requires visualisation for it to happen at all. Visualisation and observation have long been understood as critical underpinnings of theory formation, as well as practice. Over time, a series of debates have prised apart the supposed strict division between looking and theorising, as well as the assumed passivity of looking. These challenges replaced the assertion of independence with claims of causal influence running in both directions. Earlier discussion has focussed on the role of human observers, with the understanding that instrumentation played a mere enabling role, enhancing observation through technology for visualisation and visual enhancement. But new approaches in the philosophy of technology have also questioned this assumption. Postphenomenology, the set of practices leading to contemporary philosophy of technology, encompasses a set of approaches for re-evaluating the role of technology in observation, and with it reassessing the impact of observation on theory formation and clinical practice. With reference to ideas from postphenomenology, we consider the contours of a biophilosophical theory of visual observation.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Anatomy', 'Medical Education', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Visualization', 'Biological and Medical Physics, Biophysics', 'Computers and Education']"

The most critical issue is to achieve this for arrays of up to several billion floats. For this purpose, it is necessary to implement models running on CPU-based or dedicated graphic processor unit (GPU). We propose a convenient selection of volume-rendering models for the scientific community and especially data scientists. To this end we oriented our approach to an integration of these models in  Jupyter Notebook . The rendering of these datacubes is made possible thanks to an improved raycasting algorithm supporting datacubes with sizes of $$16^3$$ 16 3 , $$64^3$$ 64 3 , $$256^3$$ 256 3 , and up to $$1024^3$$ 1024 3 , corresponding to a billion cells. We designed three different rendering models: (1) an X-Ray model for 3D datacubes in a ( x ,  y ,  z ) space; (2) a model simulating the implicit surfaces of 3D datacubes in a ( x ,  y ,  z ) space; (3) and an original model, we named  Derived-rendering , for 3D datacubes in a ( x ,  y ,  t ) space where t represents time. We also introduce solutions to reduce the memory footprint and load on the GPU side. Tested with a recent hardware configuration, our proposal demonstrates we can even reach RT rendering for a billion-cell datacube.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Computational Intelligence']"

In the area of cyber security, intrusion detection system (IDS) plays a significant role to identify the existing attack from network traffic. Over the past few decades, a lot of research works have been performed in this area. Researchers have used DARPA, KDD98, KDD99, and NSL-KDD datasets as a benchmark for their experiments. However, in the current network scenario, these datasets do not intuitively reflect proper network traffic and modern low footprint attacks. In this regard, this paper proposes a novel intrusion detection technique, where principal component analysis (PCA) has been used for dimensionality reduction, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) has been applied for classification. All the experiments have been conducted over the current UNSW-NB15 dataset consisting of a total of 2540,044 records with 9 different types of modern low footprint attacks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed misuse-based technique achieved a higher detection rate and low false alarm rate in comparison with other existing methods in the literature.","['Mathematics', 'Mathematical Applications in Computer Science', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory', 'Mathematical Modeling and Industrial Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Optimization']"
doi:10.1007/978-3-031-13706-8_3,en,Frege’s Paradox and the Serial Form,OriginalPaper,"At the beginning of Logic of Sense , Deleuze defines paradox as “the affirmation of both senses or directions at once” (“ le paradoxe est l’affirmation des deux sens a la fois ”; LdS 9; LoS 1), and then he elaborates different paradoxes of sense. Thus, there are several aspects on which sense implies the affirmation of two directions at once. This affirmation is crucial to sense. As Paul Livingston in his chapter on Deleuze declares, the paradoxical aspect of sense is connected to the way it underlies becoming: “Sense for Deleuze also underlies the instability of meaning and, even more generally, the phenomena of change, flux, and becoming”, and he continues by claiming that the paradoxical aspect or the “bidirectionality” of sense “is necessary for understanding change and becoming” (Livingston, 2012: 96–97). In this regard, Deleuze’s account of sense is related to the second type of being which Plato recognizes in Parmenides and Philebus : “Pure becoming without measure, a veritable becoming-mad which never rests … and indocile matter” (LdS 9; LoS 1–2). Plato’s examples of these entities are that which is denoted by the words such as “hotter”, “colder” or “younger.” They do not denote the stable and established beings which suppose pauses and rests to be able to receive the action of the Ideas. They denote being as becoming, being as expressing itself in a diversity of modes. And as Plato’s examples indicate, being as becoming appears only in language. It is being as sense, as linguistic sense. The change that Deleuze makes here is replacing Plato’s comparative adjectives with infinitive verbs (this replacement is based on the Stoic reading and will be discussed in detail in next chapter). This replacement entails a move from “becoming” to “the event”.","['Philosophy', 'Ontology', 'Logic']"

By using similarity transformations, these non-linear partial differential equations that describe momentum, heat, and mass diffusion, are transformed into ordinary differential equations. In the boundary conditions, Runge-Kutta fourth order with shooting method numerically resolves the transformed conservation equations. The impact of significant parameters on the evaluation of temperature, velocity, as well as the concentration in the boundary layer area is thoroughly investigated. We have taken non-linear thermal radiation to achieve more meaningful outcomes during the heat transfer procedure. Magnetic nanoparticles are incredibly beneficial in biomedicine, cancer treatment, and sink float separation. There are optical switches, optical fiber-adjustable filters, and magneto-optical wavelength filters. The higher temperature of nanofluid and thicker boundary layer thickness are susceptible to thermal radiation. The findings often apply to the available evidence in a particular case and good alignment is reported.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Solid Mechanics']"

Each of these two philosophers have revived an ancient paradigm for thinking about problems of continuity in the philosophy of space and time. Peter Byrne Manchester’s 2005 book, The Syntax of Time: The Phenomenology of Time in Greek Physics and Speculative Logic from Iamblichus to Anaximander —the second in the Brill series Studies in Platonism, Neoplatonism, and the Platonic Tradition —traces Husserl’s phenomenology of inner time-consciousness back through Plotinus to Aristotle’s philosophy of time, and thereby reconnects its problematic to the most archaic origins of philosophy in the Presocratics. Through the philosophical reconstruction of an ancient worldview on the basis of an insight about the ordering principle of time as a logical syntax, Peter Manchester uncovers a neglected ancient doctrine called spherics ( sphairikē , or sphairikon logon ), which has deep implications not only for time but for all the dimensions of experience. He names his guiding figure the Sphere of the All, a formulation belonging to his ancient sources. Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka’s phenomenology of life also recognizes a previously unnoticed syntax. For her, it is the intrinsic functioning of life, which she elaborates in her phenomenology of life as ontopoietic process. Her extensive account of life’s inner-workings yields a phenomenological cosmology of multiple spheres of being grounded in a “great vision of the All” (Tymieniecka 2000, 643), much like Manchester’s spherics. The convergence to similar frameworks arrived at independently by these two philosophers is a philosophical synchronicity due to the teleology at play in their phenomenological thought, common to multiple philosophical cosmologies, but what is more remarkable is the convergence of their specific functional systems and metrological terms. This convergence arises from the pursuit of an ancient and perennial cosmology rooted in a deep synthesis of order and measure. The ancient intuition that the language of God is the language of mathematics plays a special role in classical phenomenology, and the recovery of the doctrine of the spheres represents a new contribution to the synthetic and geometrical side of this intuition. By arriving at a synthesis of the most fundamental ontological units in these two systems, a new paradigm of speculative cosmology and transcendental logic emerges from the paradigm of the sphere.","['Philosophy', 'Phenomenology']"

This interference, termed correlationism , says Meillassoux, prevents us from accessing the absolute , a claim made on the grounds of ancestrality, the fact that scientific findings about the distant past can be accomplished without the co-presence of human consciousness. Therefore, according to Meillassoux, correlationism needs to be replaced by the scientific method of mathematical formalization. The chapter challenges the conclusion that science is enabled in this way to think the absolute. Other objections raised are to Meillassoux’s assumption of the non-perspectival nature of formalization and that a single form of signification, such as formal mathematics, is sufficient in guaranteeing comprehensibility. In sharp contrast to Meillassoux’s claims to absolute truth, the chapter points to the multi-modality of hermeneutics as anchored in schematized imaginability, first theorized in Kant’s reflective-teleological reasoning allowing for discursive, creative, open-ended, indeterministic, and heuristic judgments in the service of the modest goal of intelligibility.

Different methods for accelerating MNA are reviewed in this chapter. In domain decomposition, for example, circuit analysis is efficiently parallelized, enabling faster processing if large computational resources are available. Using hierarchical matrices, the sparsity pattern of the Laplacian matrix is exploited to reduce the complexity of the analysis process. Alternative algorithms for circuit analysis are also reviewed, including the infinite mesh grid model and random walks. These techniques reduce the complexity of the circuit analysis process by avoiding costly MNA to evaluate the electrical behavior of an integrated system.","['Engineering', 'Circuits and Systems']"

For example, researches on the positive effects of “green” structures use mathematic models and geometry. Sometimes, indeterminate forms and infinities are happening. Intermediate infinite results can be correct. The following calculation can give 1/∞= 0. A superconductor conductance [Sm] is infinite. Thus, different specialists should understand the concept of infinity. The best possibility is the graphical representation. We define telescopic mapping on a metric space as a bijection by a function that maps the space to a finite figure. If the figure is a unit hypercube, there is a normalized telescopic mapping. We defined the mapping in Cartesian coordinates, which preserves the continuity, differentiability and integrability. The functions of type y  = 1/| x | after mapping behave as continuous, which allow to pick out such discontinuities. The mapping visualizes the difference between the divergence of improper integrals to infinity and by oscillations, which are mixed in some sources.

Drag Reduction (DR) is an important component to consider while designing a submarine hull, largely to lower the costs connected with it and to improve manoeuvrability. Numerous concepts for changing the hull geometry have been suggested, such as developing the hull form closer to the water drop shape. Different geometries were drawn using CAD software. Using simulations, the most suitable hydrodynamic profile was selected and analysed the drag coefficient (Cd) and lift coefficient (Cl) variation with angle of attack (AoA) in steady and transient states. Real-time constraints were imposed on the SimsCale simulation package to study how the streamlining of the underwater bodies affects the parameters like pressure and velocity, and the region it acts on. Streamlining the submarine profile showed reduced drag, which will help the submarine with the ability to change course and move faster surftly, giving it a significant tactical edge.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Solid Mechanics']"

These problems lead to large catastrophic failures of piping in industries. Thus, intermittent slug and plug type of patterns have made the researchers to study and estimate the flow characteristics accurately. With this motivation, present work is focused on accurate measurement for intermittent flow characteristics using modified image processing technique in MATLAB. In the second step of background subtraction, a Modified Frame Difference Method (MFDM) is implemented that gives better foreground image extraction compared to approximate median method. Background image for the next time step is considered to be actual time series image of previous time step. Further, Binary Large Object (BLOB) extraction analysis is carried out in place of normal edge detection as the latter is having difficulties in slug movement tracking. The BLOBs extracted are traced by forming the enclosing box around the region of interest after morphological operation. For the estimation of flow characteristics, the location of the enclosing box at each step is saved in an array of matrix. Finally, a close agreement is obtained between conventional method measurements and the findings of the present implemented technique, with the mean errors being 0.5% and 0.92% for the liquid plug velocity and liquid plug length, respectively. Intermittent flow characteristics (such as slug/plug frequency, liquid plug/slug length, liquid slug/plug velocity) can be estimated accurately using proposed technique.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Fluid Dynamics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Solid Mechanics']"

One type of the heat exchangers known as Shell and Tube heat exchangers (STHX) which are the utilized in oil refineries and chemical industries due to wide range of applications. The main aim of this work is to investigate the thermo-hydraulic behavior of shell and tube heat exchangers with single segmental baffle configuration. Single segmental baffles have been inserted in shell and tube heat exchanger to augment heat transfer performances and the exchanger performance parameters have been compared with different single segmental baffle cuts. Three different baffle configurations have been considered at 22.5, 34.5, and 41.5% of baffle cuts. Parameters like coefficient of heat transfer, effectiveness, and pressure drop are considered for the measurement of performance and efficiency of heat exchangers. The design of exchanger has been carried out by using Bell-Delaware method to satisfy TEMA standards. The 3D modeling has been done for different configurations with CATIA software. The performance analysis has been carried out through computational fluid dynamics by using ANSYS-FLUENT.

J. Oper. Res. 279:159–167, 2019 [ 1 ]). Most real-world decision making takes place in a complex environment, and therefore, the use of these linguistic scorings can become a tool for dealing with vagueness, imprecision and uncertainty. Both criteria scores for the considered alternatives and criteria weights can be expressed using fuzzy set theory in fuzzy numbers. In addition, when the MCDM is conducted by a group of decision makers, the impact of disagreement among them can be further characterized using these fuzzy numbers. One way of accounting for the uncertainties, related to the fuzziness in the MCDM-inputs, is the substitution of the ordinal linguistic scores by triangular fuzzy numbers (TFN) followed by a set of Monte Carlo runs of the MCDM. In this paper, we report on a case study of which the goal is to select the most appropriate of five candidate countermeasures to remediate an agricultural parcel contaminated with the radionuclide Cs-137. The linguistic evaluation scales according to which two of the criteria and the criteria weights are scored were converted in TFN and then sampled using a Monte Carlo procedure to generate 10.000 rankings of the alternative countermeasures. We demonstrate that the ranking resulting from the deterministic approach is increasingly challenged when the uncertainties resulting from (1) the linguistic criteria scores, (2) the linguistic criteria weights and (3) the disagreement between decision makers are additively considered. The outcome is a fuzzy ranking of alternatives that should make decision makers think twice about the apparent superiority or inferiority of alternatives.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Optimization', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory']"

Thus, new approaches have been defined to model decision makers’ indecision by means of complex linguistic expressions such as Extended Comparative Linguistic Expressions with Symbolic Translation (ELICIT), based on the 2-tuple linguistic model. Nevertheless, this approach, alike many other linguistic models, uses linear scales to model decision makers’ preferences. Recent studies show that humans do not measure the distances between values at different levels of the linear scale in the same way and better decisions are obtained when nonlinear scales are considered. Therefore, this chapter introduces a multi-criteria group decision making model based on fuzzy TOPSIS dealing with ELICIT information which considers the nonlinear scales provided by the recently defined extreme values amplifications. It provides flexibility to express decision makers’ preferences and guarantees more reliable results than those obtained with the classical linear scaled preferences.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Optimization', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory']"

It considers factors of enriching AI models by cognitive semantics, which experts help to create. The actual practice has shown that the process of model building can be costly and long term. An analysis of relevant big data (BD) can help to automate the process of cognitive modelling. There are two directions of automation: a) verification of cognitive models and b) synthesizing ones. The author’s convergent approach based on the inverse problem-solving method and the genetic algorithm for decision-making on the cognitive model was applied.

An experimental test and actual practice application of the approach have shown a high level of the models’ verifications accuracy (about 93%) but a low level of accuracy of models synthesizing (about 34%).

The results were identified through extensive literature search conducted in the Central and Eastern European Online Library (CEEOL), EBSCO: Academic Search Complete, EBSCO: eBook Academic Collection and ScienceDirect, Academic Search Complete, Health Source: Consumer Edition, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science and Wiley Online Library for a time period between 2006 and 2021 by using a combination of the following free-text terms: autism, ASD, social skills, serious games, computer games, education, communication, software, portable, computer-based. The search was limited to papers published in the English language.

Whenever the high buildings and temples arches need to be coloring, they consume more time and a greater number of labor to complete it. The finishing of the given task depends on many external factors. To be independent of many external factors, a smart drone with loaded colors is assigned and loads the texture that is expected as output. As the intelligence is loaded to the drone as well as the specific sensors are embedded to it in order to notify the information about the color’s deficiency is detected, any resource to be required to complete the given task according to the given texture, any accidental collisions also notified and be a safeguard, and etc. The output of this study is an array that allows analysis on how many are identical textures, coloring were processed done using SSIM measure. The major advantages are manpower is becoming almost NIL while been painting; the time consumed for the task given is to be completed in less time. The accuracies and their performances are measured and are depicted in the results when comparing this approach against the traditional and semi-automated approaches.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']"

As studied in the literature, the resiliency can contribute to the flexibility of supply chains for fulfilling the fluctuations by enabling redundancy. However, the level of redundancy can be an interesting topic from lean management perspective to be managed. This paper has focused on the context of aggregation of Lean and resiliency management these and has proposed a trade-off matrix method. The integration and aggregation of lean and resilient supply chain (SC) practices are investigated with a special focus for creation of synergy. The paper also has investigated the impact of this integration on SC performance through a case study in context of the COVID-19 ventilator production. This case has been designed to highlight the tradeoff analysis among lean and resilience concepts. By applying an Analytic Hierarchy Process model, the paper has enabled a decision-making framework for determination of redundancy level.

IoT consists of a complex network of smart devices that frequently exchange data over the Internet. The aim of IoT is to make everything in our world under control and also keeping them up-to-date about the state of the things. IoT devices sense the environment and send the obtained information to the Internet cloud without the necessity of human-to-human or human-to-machine connection. Wireless sensors have limited energy resources due to the use of batteries to supply energy, and since it is usually not possible to replace the batteries of these sensors. In addition, the lifespan of the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is limited and short. Therefore, reducing the energy consumption of sensors in IoT networks for increasing network lifespan is one of the fundamental challenges and issues in these networks. The literature included here provides an overview of some of the most current research methodologies about the most popular protocols.

In the case of dying nodes, battery discharge may cause the network to get disconnected. WSN design issues, e.g., location of sensor nodes, scheduling activities, routes of data flow, mobile sink route, should be dealt with keeping energy limitation in mind. The sensor nodes sense the data from the area of concern and communicate the same to the sink for processing. Sensor nodes deployed in various application areas have limited memory, computational power, and battery backup. There is no defined topology of such network and frequently changing environment, very less amount of battery, and limited storage capability of the nodes. It is essential that each node in the network has knowledge about the routing path to the sink which is energy efficient. Since random placement of the nodes restrains coders from presuming routing table data at the sensor nodes, numerous methods have been suggested to create a dynamic path up to sink. Numerous researches are performed for WSN using the mobile sink. Most of the research activities focused on energy conservation in the background while proposing approaches for clustering, data flow paths, trajectory design, etc. In the WSN with a mobile sink, the trajectory of the sink node plays a vital role. Designing of trajectory is an NP-hard problem. With the use of nature-inspired techniques, e.g., particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), etc., can be used for generating a nearly optimal paths for the mobile sink. In this current article, the authors make attempt to present the summary of various strategies for energy-efficient data collection methodology and energy-efficient path planning of mobile sink in wireless sensor networks.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Mobile and Network Security', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

This predisposition is quite apparent in everyday life: different people respond differently to the same visual information. The careful utilization of this phenomenon can be extremely utilitarian. This is apparent from the recent widespread acknowledgment of visual bias, and its manipulation to bring about salutary business effects. Today, visual bias utilization can be seen at play in a number of different industries ranging from advertisements to recommendation systems of OTT giants. Despite the fact that the existence of visual bias is now widely accepted, few empirical studies have been conducted to confirm the same. The present article and the ensuing research serve to bridge that gap. In our article, we elucidate the salient points of the research. We conducted using movie posters as a means of estimating and studying the effects of visual bias. We built a Web application to survey and collect user ratings for movie posters belonging to different genres and thus having different visual effects. Based on the user’s input, a bias mapping was done, and the result of which was the genre that the user was most visually partial to. Contingent on that, neural style transformation was applied to movie posters, and the augmented results were presented to the user to rate. By comparing the initial genre-wise ratings to the transformed genre ratings, the extent of visual bias was detected and thus analyzed. Our study not only confirmed the empirical existence of such bias, but the detection methodology outlined here may serve as a visual bias manipulation tool that can utilize real-time machine learning to optimize AdSense and the likes.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Systems and Data Security', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']"

In this framework, the increasing number of bridge collapses has progressively fueled the interest towards the development of reliable monitoring strategies, able to efficiently ensure real-time bridge assessment and early-stage damage detection. To this aim, recent advancements in sensor technologies and data science have strongly encouraged the use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Within the unsupervised learning context, this paper proposes an innovative convolutional autoencoder-based damage detection technique applied to the Z24 benchmark bridge. Firstly, raw acceleration sequences of user-defined length are converted into images using the Gramian Angular Field Approach (GAF). Then, during the training, the model learns how to correctly reconstruct healthy data acquired by SHM systems. The trained network is afterwards tested with unknown data and the mean absolute error (MAE), considered as a damage-sensitive feature, is adopted to quantify the errors between the original input and reconstructed output. Finally, damage detection is performed when the percentage of damaged sequences within a pre-defined macro-sequence exceeds a properly fixed threshold. Results prove that the implemented ML algorithm, working at the level of single sensor, is effective to enable continuous assessment of large-scale monitored bridges as new data is collected, involving limited computational efforts.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Monitoring/Environmental Analysis', 'Analytical Chemistry']"

And so, for the last few years, many online environments have been developed to help kids acquire the coding skills needed in the 21st century in a fun and interactive way. This paper uses a mixed approach to investigate elementary students’ performance in programming after engaging in a 2-week online programme using the Tynker platform. The data was collected through observations and surveys. Children used Blockly programming (Python-based) to create animated stories, collages, and games. At the end of the program, the learners were assessed by a multiple-choice quiz. Additionally, they created a project that covered all the concepts covered during the program. Successful examples from classroom observations are drawn to illustrate how students make practical use of the Tynker platform. Additionally, 117 closed-question surveys were analysed to determine the students’ accurate perceptions about the coding and online platform. The interpretation of the findings implies that the students’ programming knowledge acquisition follows a progressive path. However, the findings show that while all students learned the basics of coding, there were some differences in performance and understanding. This paper bridges the gap related to the insufficient attention in educational research towards teaching coding to primary students. The findings would help stakeholders to develop more capacity-building training programmes for young learners.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Data Engineering']"

In this paper we focus on expansions of an AF where solely the addition of new arguments and attacks is allowed and the original framework remains unchanged. Existing results about the enforcement problem under strong and normal expansion are all sufficient conditions. We argue that necessary and sufficient conditions are essential concerning the solvability of the enforcement problem. Specifically, two necessary and sufficient conditions are identified for the non-strict enforcement in respectively the odd-length cycle free and the even-length cycle free AFs under strong expansion. This result can be used to determine that when new arguments satisfying the condition are unavailable, enforcing the desired set simply becomes unsolvable.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

There are 240 freight villages established in Europe, and the logistics sector ranked third. The value of freight village is increasing in the economic system and the logistics industry. Presenting information by measuring the efficiency of freight village is important to help companies investing in this area. It is deemed necessary to determine the level of efficient operation of the freight village, to increase their performance, and to analyze the efficient use of their resources. This study aims to determine the interactions between criteria and the criteria priorities for the freight village efficiency evaluation. After selecting the significant criteria from related literature, pairwise comparisons as data are obtained from experts’ views. The interactions between criteria via fuzzy DEMATEL method and priorities via fuzzy AHP method are determined. According to findings, “annual amount of freight transport” is determined as the general affecting and overwhelmingly the most important criterion; then, it is recommended to decision makers/researchers to consider that criterion with a high weight in the freight village efficiency evaluation. On the other hand, “number of employees” is observed as both the highly impressed and least important criterion; then, it may be ignored in freight village assessments or represented with a significantly too small weight, with its controversial position in the output or input. One of the originalities of this study is that considering the DEMATEL-AHP results together at the evaluation stage of each criterion; it provides an opportunity to present unique perspectives on the process of analyzing the criteria.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Optimization', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory']"

The number of buildings in which many natural resources are consumed during the construction phase and severe damage to the environment caused by the wastes generated is constantly increasing. The construction of green buildings can reduce these negativities caused by the construction. Environmental sustainability in Turkey is still in its infancy. The goal of this research is to define and rank sustainability indicators to evaluate green building production in Turkey as a tool for assessing sustainability. To evaluate green buildings, 12 criteria in four dimensions have been presented. The weights of the dimensions and criteria addressed in the assessment framework were determined using the novel fuzzy level-based weight assessment (LBWA), which can represent human reasoning. The results show that ecology and energy-saving are the most critical dimensions in evaluating green building production in Turkey while reducing waste and health are the least essential dimensions. Research output can be a valuable reference for green building builders in the country. It can serve as a guide to selecting and promoting optimal applications in green building products.

In this study, aluminum AlMgSi0.5 (EN AW-6060) was coated onto silicon nitride Si $$_{3}{\text{N}}_{4}$$ 3 N 4 ceramic substrates using friction surfacing technology. Experimental work revealed that the harmful effects of thermal shock ( e.g. , substrate cracking, coating delamination) observed with other material combinations can be avoided by selecting materials with a low coefficient of thermal expansion, low Young’s modulus and high thermal conductivity. Design of experiments derived models for coating thickness and bonding strength fit the data well ( i.e. , the regression model accounts for most of the variation in the response variable). Whereas the coating thickness is predominately dependent on the rotational speed used, the bonding strength is also affected by the traverse speed. Coating thicknesses upto 2.03 mm and bonding strengths of 42.5 MPa were achieved. Deposition rates exceed those of physical vapor deposition by a magnitude of ×1000 and bonding strength is on-par with thin-film metallization. Scanning transmission electron microscope analysis revealed formation of a glassy phase at the interface. Using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis high silicon and oxygen content with smaller percentages of aluminum and nitrogen were detected. High-resolution transmission electron microscope imaging revealed no distinct lattice structure leading to the assumption that the composition is predominantly amorphous and consists of SiAlON.","['Materials Science', 'Metallic Materials', 'Characterization and Evaluation of Materials', 'Structural Materials', 'Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films', 'Nanotechnology']"

According to the developments in computer and communication technologies, health information systems have quickly been used in health institutions. On the other hand, with the spread of health information systems, problems were encountered in ensuring inter-institutional standards and quality. At this point, the selection of health information systems that are compatible with national and international health systems and that will meet the current and future needs of health institutions have gained importance. Purpose of this study is to determine the effective criteria in the selection of health information systems and the importance levels of these criteria. The criteria determined by scanning the literature were reduced to eight (security, cost, system quality and technical support, design, statistical information delivery, decision support system inclusion, accessibility, integration with external systems and subsystem inclusivity) by using the Delphi method with expert opinions. The spherical fuzzy DEMATEL method was applied to determine the importance levels of the criteria. The study will provide important novelties in terms of using the Delphi method at the point of determining the criteria and considering fuzziness and the interaction between the criteria.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Optimization', 'Operations Research/Decision Theory']"

The chapter divides the modernisation of teacher education into the following areas: optimising the structure of vocational teacher training; improving the content and form of teacher training; and updating teacher education on a research basis. In the context of national teacher education reforms, openness, self-organisation, self-determination, and self-development are becoming its essential characteristics. The chapter concludes that the new realities of our time dictate the need for new areas of pedagogics, such as STEM education, robotic engineering, migration education, neuro-pedagogics, and the development of human capital for the future economy.","['Education', 'Teaching and Teacher Education', 'International and Comparative Education', 'Professional & Vocational Education', 'Education, general']"

Their instruction was identified as being on the continuum between expository and constructivist teaching, with more leaning towards an expository approach in their teaching. The data disclose that the reasons for this prevalence of expository teaching are based on the lecturers’ rational choice rather than any overall attribution to their educational culture.

We consider that the causes of this problem are the lack of motivation that, along with traditional methods, do not favor student learning. For this reason, we propose the Flipped Classroom, with constructive alignment to improve students’ performance in these courses that will be measured using the SOLO Taxonomy, which allows evaluating different levels of learning. We use a quantitative approach with a pre-experimental design, applying a pre-test, followed by the traditional method, and, then, a post-test. In the second part of the course, we used the Flipped Classroom and compared the test results. We noticed a significant difference between the final grades of exam 1 (traditional method) and exam 2 (Flipped Classroom method), considering that the average value of the Flipped Classroom grade ( $$14.7 \pm 0.279$$ 14.7 ± 0.279 ) is much higher than the average value of the score when we used the traditional method ( $$12.5 \pm 0.279$$ 12.5 ± 0.279 ).

The goal is to reveal geometric principles and construction rules underlying the design and the textile structure. These aspects are generally difficult to interpret for those who deal with textile design and who frequently follow a practical and intuitive approach and are not always supported by a real geometric awareness of graphic constructs.

Their primary usage is to perform image classifying tasks. All neural networks, including convolutional neural networks, are susceptible to the overfitting issue, which can occur when the network exhibits good performance on the train data while failing to accurately predict the new data when it is fed to the inputs. Few regularization approaches exist that may help in avoiding the overfit. This paper proposes a novel swarm intelligence optimization method to address the overfitting problem by choosing the adequate dropout parameter value. Swarm algorithms have previously been used to optimize the structure of neural networks; however, the full potential of these algorithms has yet not been thoroughly investigated. Scientists must invest a lot of time to choose the appropriate dropout value if they execute this task manually. In this research, an automated framework, that uses improved sine cosine metaheuristics to perform this task, is proposed. The proposed framework was tested on four standard benchmark datasets, namely MNIST, CIFAR10, Semeion, and UPS. The simulation results have been validated against the results generated by several other state-of-the-art swarm intelligence algorithms. The comparison shows that the proposed method outperforms other cutting-edge algorithms in terms of classification error, therefore achieving higher accuracy percentage.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Cognitive Psychology', 'Personality and Social Psychology', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing']"

Some individuals and organizations encrypt the original data and store them in the data bank for privacy protection. Data bank is also called data cloud. Therefore, the cloud stores a large amount of original data, which is obviously a huge wealth. How to use these data effectively? First of all, we must solve the problem of calculation of these encrypted data, which is called a privacy calculation problem. Rivest, Adleman and Dertouzos conjecture that if all data is fully homomorphic encryption, that is, the addition and multiplication of ciphertext are homomorphic to the corresponding addition and multiplication of plaintext, then the encrypted data can be effectively computed by elementary calculation without changing the structure of the plaintext data (under the condition of homomorphism). The RAD conjecture has been proposed for more than 30 years, but no one could solve this problem since the cryptographic structure of the fully homomorphic encryption system is too complicated. In 2009, C. Gentry, a computer scholar at Stanford University, first proposed a fully homomorphic encryption scheme in Gentry (2009b) based on ideal lattice, for which he won the 2022 highest award in theoretical computer science—the Godel Award.

Let $$R=\mathbb {Z}[x]/<\phi (x)>$$ be a quotient ring of the integer coefficients polynomials ring, Lyubashevsky and Micciancio regarded an ideal lattice as the correspondence of an ideal of R , but they neither explain how to extend this definition to whole Euclidean space $$\mathbb {R}^n$$ , nor exhibit the relationship of cyclic lattices and ideal lattices. In this chapter, we regard the cyclic lattices and ideal lattices as the correspondences of finitely generated R -modules, so that we may show that ideal lattices are actually a special subclass of cyclic lattices, namely cyclic integer lattices.

Data reveal that there was an observed distinction between the Chinese EMI lecturers’ ideology of language and pedagogical practices. In the mainstream the lecturers were not confident with their English capabilities and presented as monolingual advocates evident in their support for English imperialism. Evidence of actioning their translanguaging resources indicated a survival strategy to counter the delays in their cognitive thinking to control the language flow during their lectures. Translanguaging conflicted with their aspirations to be EMI lecturers with ‘native like’ English. The EMI lecturers viewed their own translanguaging behavior as exemplifying deficiencies and inaccuracies. A small group of the lecturers who were fluent in English were open and receptive to translanguaging practices. This group of lecturers, whilst in the minority, drew positively on translanguaging in their EMI teaching to enhance students’ learning and engagement. They confirmed their comfort and confidence integrating both languages in EMI teaching, demonstrating a positive bilingual translanguaging identity.

Subsequently, Ajtai and Dwork presented the first lattice-based cryptosystem, which is called the Ajtai-Dwork cryptosystem in the academic circles. The proof of this cryptosystem resisting Shor’s quantum computing is to apply Ajtai reduction principle to transform searching for collision points of the Hash function into the SIS problem, and Ajtai reduction principle proves that the difficulty of solving the SIS problem is polynomially equivalent to the shortest vector problem on lattice. The main purpose of this chapter is to prove the Ajtai reduction principle.","['Economics', 'Macroeconomics/Monetary Economics//Financial Economics', 'Applications of Mathematics']"

This fruit is classified into tens of different cultivars based on fruit, flesh, and tree features. In this project, five different rambutan cultivars classification models using deep learning techniques were developed based on a 1000 rambutan images dataset. Common deep learning methods for the image classification task, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and transfer learning method were applied to recognize each rambutan variant. Results have shown that the VGG16 pre-trained model performed best as it achieved 96% accuracy on the test dataset.

Substantive theory shows what interventions Interventions or manipulations to the measurement mechanism can be traded off against a change to the object measure to hold the observed outcome constant. A Rasch model Rasch model integrated with a substantive theory dictates the form and substance of permissible interventions Interventions . Rasch analysis, absent construct theory Construct theory and an associated specification equation, is a black box in which understanding may be more illusory than not. Finally, the quantitative hypothesis can be tested by comparing theory-based trade-off relations with observed trade-off relations. Only quantitative variables (as measured) support such trade-offs. Note that to test the quantitative hypothesis requires more than manipulation of the algebraic equivalencies in the Rasch model or descriptively fitting data to the model. A causal Rasch model Rasch model involves experimental intervention/manipulation on either reader ability or text complexity or a conjoint intervention Interventions on both simultaneously to yield a successful prediction of the resultant observed outcome (count correct). We conjecture that when this type of manipulation is introduced for individual reader text encounters and model predictions are consistent with observations, the quantitative hypothesis is sustained.","['Physics', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Education, general', 'Psychometrics', 'Applied Statistics']"

It is known that in such situations, the distribution of the resulting deviations is close to Gaussian, and thus, that the copulas – that describe the multi-D distribution as a function of 1-D ones – are also Gaussian. In the past, these conclusions were also applied to economic phenomena, until the 2008 crisis showed that in economics, Gaussian models can lead to disastrous consequences. At present, all economists agree that the economic distributions are not Gaussian – however, surprisingly, Gaussian copulas still often provide an accurate description of economic phenomena.

The main reason is that it provides the best linear unbiased predictor and it is an exact interpolator when normality is assumed. The robustness of this method allows small departures from normality, however, many meteorological, pollutant and environmental variables have extremely asymmetrical distributions and Kriging cannot be used. Machine learning techniques such as neural networks, random forest, and k -nearest neighbor can be used instead, because they do not require specific distributional assumptions. The drawback is that they do not take account of the spatial dependence, and for an optimal performance in spatial random fields more complex machine learning techniques could be considered. These techniques also require a relatively large amount of training data and they are computationally challenging to implement. For a reduced number of observations, we illustrate the performance of the aforementioned procedures using daily rainfall data of manual meteorological gauge stations in Navarre, where the only auxiliary variables available are the spatial coordinates and the altitude. The quality of the predictions is carefully checked through three versions of the relative root mean squared error (RRMSE). The conclusion is that when we cannot use Kriging, random forest and neural networks outperform k -nearest neighbor technique, and provide reliable predictions of rainfall daily data with scarce auxiliary information.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Mathematics', 'Data Engineering', 'Statistics for Engineering, Physics, Computer Science, Chemistry and Earth Sciences', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Mathematical Applications in Computer Science']"

This implies a view of democracy based on deliberative exercise and critical evaluation to arrive at the best possible solution to given problems. As a result, the notion of deliberative teaching has been developed (a type of dialogic teaching) that refers to an organization of the curricular contents around the exercise of argumentative deliberation, that is, promoting a democratic dialogue around genuine curricular controversies that require a collective effort to be resolved by consensus. This type of teaching has empirically shown to benefit political competencies, social cohesion, and impacts in disciplinary concept learning for students. The problem is that global evidence shows that a transmissive and monological pedagogy is still maintained. Thus, we face the challenge of changing pedagogical practices, which directs attention to how teacher professional development programs promote transformations in pedagogical teaching. One of the alternatives for teacher professional development that has shown promising results is the so-called use of “educative curriculum materials.” These cognitive tools have emerged as a crucial option for addressing teacher learning and changing practices. However, despite these empirical benefits, it is also necessary to understand and explore the theoretical assumptions underlying the use of these materials. This chapter aims to explore a theoretical foundation that discusses the cognitivist perspective underlying the use of these materials. Just as we understand dialogic theory to explain student learning through language speech, the functioning of these materials will be explored from this theory that, in turn, explains the role of language involved in these adult learning processes. Finally, the practical implications of these curricular tools are discussed.","['Education', 'International and Comparative Education', 'Education, general']"

Ubidots have wide number of knowledge visualizing options, and it is an attention grabbing user-friendly interface. Signup by providing all the required details. After installing the required libraries in Arduino IDE, connect the ESP32 module to computer/laptop to upload the program. After successfully uploading in open serial monitor, on the serial monitor, we will see our ESP32 successfully connected to the programmed Wi-Fi and allocated with IP address. Then, it initiated MQTT connection with Ubidot cloud and connected to it. Then, it started publishing ECG data alongside a time stamp. Each data packet contains a variable label and 4 precise time-stamp data points. You can see the live Electrocardiogram on the Ubidots dashboardor platform. Ubidots will receive data from our ESP32 Module and plot the variable on the graph with provided Epoch Timestamp. Since we are sending data with timestamp, there will be no delay due to server latency on the graph. This helps to plot an exact electrocardiogram for Ubidots.

Labeled data is needed for learning models. The expert is required for obtaining the labeled data. Sometimes, it is costly or expert is not available. So, to overcome this dependency, crowd labeled data is used to train a model. Crowd (a set of novices) is asked to assign a category as defined by IBM’s Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC) to the defect reports. Obtaining categories through crowd can be inaccurate or noisy.

Psychological theories such as arousal potential suggest that an appropriate level of arousal would induce a positive valence, but extreme arousal potentials induce negative valence. This chapter proposes a general mathematical formulation of the emotional arousal potential elicited by both novelty and complexity. The model formulates the arousal potential as information contents to be processed in the brain after sensory stimuli are perceived or recognized; this is termed as surprisal . I mathematically demonstrate that the surprisal represents free energy , which is originally a thermodynamic quantity, and that it is equivalent to the summation of information contents both from novelty (i.e., information gain) and from complexity or uncertainty (i.e., negative-log-likelihood averaged over Bayesian posterior). Novelty, uncertainty, and complexity all act as factors that form the arousal potential. An aesthetic evaluation experiment using profile shapes supports the model hypothesis that the summation of novelty and complexity determines the inverse U-shaped beauty function. A discussion on the potential of free energy as a mathematical principle is presented to explain the emotion initiators (i.e., arousal potential). The model provides a general mathematical framework for understanding and predicting emotions caused by novelty, uncertainty, and complexity.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Computers and Society', 'Engineering Design', 'Operations Management']"

Delay at bus stops affects the efficiency of bus operations and the level of service of public transportation. Day-to-day delay variability decreases passenger confidence in perceived reliability, causing uncertainty in making travel decisions. Many research works have been carried out to find delays at bus stops, but there are very few studies about the delay at bus stops in India using automatic vehicle location (AVL) data. In the present study, an attempt has been made to analyze delays at various bus stops in Mysore city using vehicle trajectory-based formulation based on AVL data collected from the Mysore Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Delay variability has been analyzed using the coefficient of variation (COV) and also by fitting various probability distributions to the data, since distribution fitting helps in estimating the pattern of delay variability. The goodness of fit is tested by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test. The results suggest that bus stops in the commercial area face more variability than the bus stops in residential areas. By fitting various distributions to delay data, it was observed that the performance of the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution in fitting the data is better than other distributions.","['Engineering', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Mechanical Engineering']"

Among several aspects, scholars investigate organisational, technological, strategical or more distinctive traits concerning DT initiatives, such as motivation, implication or policy. However, only a few of them discuss DT initiatives focusing on the non-profit sector and the non-profit organisations (NPOs) in particular, which is the main aim of this work. This research takes over as a further step into a project intended to investigate DT initiatives in the context of NPOs. Specifically, this study comes after the development of a taxonomy identified by a systematic overview of the literature discussing DT in NPOs, afterwards used in classifying selected articles. This contribution seeks to apply some exploratory multivariate techniques performing a cluster analysis on the classification formerly pursued. To this end, we adopt the multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and the hierarchical clustering on principal component (HCPC) methods by using some R packages. The outcome of this paper is threefold: (i) to analyse the associations between the multiple categorical variables defined by the taxonomy, (ii) to identify clouds of articles with similar discussion traits, and (iii) to group articles into clusters of similar contributions. Hence, we firstly pre-process the indicator matrix as input for the MCA. Next, we identify the principal components to reduce dimensionality. Afterwards, we adopt the Euclidean distance to find similarity among articles and Ward distance for partitioning. As a result, nine clusters recognise some recurrent patterns which would describe DT initiatives in NPOs.","['Business and Management', 'IT in Business', 'Business Information Systems', 'Organization', 'Business and Management, general', 'Organizational Studies, Economic Sociology']"

Individuals with mental illnesses face many obstacles such as stigma, prejudice, and unemployment, which dissuades them from seeking help. The emergence of COVID-19 brought light to the importance of mental health. Current online patient–provider networking services act as the proverbial phone book, and finding the right provider can be a shot in the dark. There is a lack of opportunity to converse, connect or interact with providers without paying for a formal appointment. As a result, patients have a hard time finding a compatible provider. In this paper, we present details of a comprehensive journal-like patient and provider connectivity solution for the management of mental disorders. In addition to providing a platform for individuals with mental disorders to confidentially connect with medical service and insurance providers, it allows for group forums among peers. Communication and trust can be enriched with a networking application that allows patients (under an anonymous alias) and providers to freely monitor, like mention and interact with one another before initial contact. Building a privacy-focused networking platform on top of well-known communication mediums like forums and blogs can enhance communication, visibility, and understanding. Better communication, trust, and understanding lead to high-quality therapy.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Professional Computing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

At present, for high-precision determination of the coordinates of the motion parameters of unmanned aerial vehicles, with a known motion model, algorithms based on the Kalman-Bucy filter or the least squares method are used, since the potential estimation accuracy of these methods is almost the same. However, in order to estimate the motion parameters of constantly maneuvering aircraft, it is necessary to use the method of estimating from a selection of measurements in a “sliding window”. Comparative evaluation using algebraic polynomials, Chebyshev polynomials and fractional polynomials by the method of least squares “in a sliding window” showed that the use of fractional polynomials allows us to evaluate not only changes in coordinates and velocities, but also using fractional derivatives, other parameters that occupy an intermediate position between coordinates, the first and second derivatives with respect to coordinates. The latter makes it possible to improve the accuracy of estimates of the coordinates of the motion parameters of maneuvering unmanned aerial vehicles. Moreover, the most acceptable polynomial for estimation is a polynomial with fractional degrees equal to 2.5. The use of fractional Taylor series in the problem of estimating the motion parameters of constantly maneuvering quadrocopters makes it possible not to use recurrent estimation algorithms with adaptation elements, but to achieve the same goal by changing the degree of the polynomial.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']"

However, all HUMS application based on fiber optics can be enabled thanks to the proposed Smart Veil: a technology consisting of a thin composite membrane incorporating fiber optics placed on a complex path. This integrated element makes the monitoring system easy to use/handle, robust and reliable in real operating scenarios, capable of guaranteeing precise measurements. The effectiveness of this technological solution is proven by means of the manufacturing of a sensorized helicopter blade mockup. Among the several techniques that can be adopted using a fiber optic, FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensors have been selected, allowing a robust punctual measure in specific locations. The choice of sensors position was led by the idea to exploit a digital twin for shape reconstruction and load identification, so all the components of the relevant loads acting on a tail rotor blade during operation can be obtained: axial, beam bending, chord bending and torsion. All sensors benefit from the use of the smart veil that guarantees robust and precise measures. Particularly, the torsional sensors do, since they need to be placed on an ad hoc path. The static calibration test and a comparison with a strain gauges system permitted a validation and showed the advantages of the technological solution proposed.","['Engineering', 'Building Repair and Maintenance', 'Cyber-physical systems, IoT', 'Industrial and Production Engineering']"

The competitor to boxing has recently risen in the form of mixed martial arts (MMA), which is becoming quite a famous sport, most notably recognized due to the Ultimate Fighting Championship promotion (UFC). As with most other competitive sports, it is never obvious who will emerge as the winner of a specific MMA bout, as the sport is very unpredictable by nature. This paper focuses on using machine learning (ML) algorithms and classifiers to predict the winners of MMA bouts in the Ultimate Fighting Championship promotion. The data used to train and test the algorithms and classifiers is sampled from the rich UFC database which includes details from all bouts that have taken place in the UFC throughout the history of the promotion. The predictions are obtained without using any data that can directly indicate the winner of a bout. The results are presented through accuracy percentages for two different types of sample sets. Successful bout prediction percentages range from 80% to just over 92% across all subsets. This model can be further expanded and modified to predict the winner for future matchups in the promotion.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence']"

Pastures are maintained to ensure a good quality and quantity of the feed to get the best produce from the animals. Traditional ways of managing the pastures are costly and labor intensive. The use of technology in farming introduced the concept of smart farming which made pasture management easier and cost effective. Smart farming integrates advanced technological methods that include Internet of Things (IoT), big data and cloud computing. These enable tracking, monitoring, automating and complex operational analysis operations. However even with the use of these new technological techniques there are still challenges facing pasture management. Pastures are dependent on climatic conditions therefore climate change has a great impact on pasture management. With the onset of climate change, it has become a challenge for livestock farmers to predict weather conditions therefore it is impossible for decision makers to deal more effectively with the effects of climate variability. However, the digital twin concept proved to be the best technique to tackle these challenges due to its complex prediction techniques that include artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.

A gripper attached to the UAV would help in grasping, holding and placing the object of interest during these operations. In this work, we propose and analyze one degree of freedom gripper mechanism that has six links and seven revolute joints. The kinematic analysis is done by treating the gripper mechanism as two four-bar mechanisms that form two loops. A two-stage vector loop method is used to determine the joint angles. In order to statically balance the gripper mechanism, the coordinates of all the joints in the mechanism at various positions of the links are found out. The method of principal vectors is used for the complete balancing of the mechanism. In this method, each vector is directed along with one of the links, and the position of the center of mass of the entire mechanism is given by the addition of these vectors in series. The coefficients of these principal vectors are determined by summing the mass-weighted position vector of every center of mass of the link. Counterweights are added to the links for statico-dynamic balancing of the gripper mechanism. The dynamic analysis is done using the Newtonian solution method. There are 15 equations with 15 unknown contact forces and torque acting in the gripper mechanism. Solving these equations, we obtain the forces acting on the links, and torque required for driving the gripper mechanism. The gripper mechanism was then modeled using a CAD software. It was fabricated by 3D printing the parts and assembling them together. The gripper was finally mounted below a hexacopter and tested in the outdoor environment by carrying and dropping a spherical object.","['Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics']"

Over the previous five years, gamification has increased student motivation and academic performance. This study will examine the previous literature to see how gamification will disseminate over time, educational level (from nursery to college), causes, and the most frequently used game elements. A systematic literature review will search interdisciplinary databases for quantitative experimental studies examining educational gamification and providing information on current research lines. According to the findings of a comprehensive research study, gamification can be advantageous at all academic levels, from elementary school to college. Following systematic research, gamified learning can increase students’ motivation and intellectual accomplishment. Student learning may be made more pleasurable via gamification, which is the first advantage of this type of instruction. When used in the classroom, gamification can assist students who are weak in motivation and performing poorly academically. Because of the diversity of challenges and rewards that gaming parts provide, incorporating gaming elements into the classroom may serve as a motivational tool for students to learn.

Researchers have developed algorithms to detect the presence of COVID-19 in X-ray and CT scans and images. These methodologies produce skewed data and incorrect disease detection. So, in the case of COVID-19 forecasting utilizing CT scans in an IoT setting, the current study paper established an oppositional-based deep dense convolutional neural network (DDCNN) and chimp optimization algorithm. The framework proposed is divided into two stages: preprocessing and estimation. Previously, a CT scan pictures generated from anticipated COVID-19 are acquired utilizing IoT devices from an open-source system. After that, the photos are preprocessed with a Gaussian function. A Gaussian filter can be used to remove undesirable noise from CT scan pictures that have been obtained. The preprocessed photos are then transmitted to the prediction process. DDCNN is applied to the images preprocessed in this step. The recommended classifier is designed to be as efficient as possible using the oppositional-based chimp optimization algorithm (OCOA). This approach is used to choose the best classifier parameters under consideration.

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-10853-2_8,en,Behavior of Crane Beams in Bending and Restraint Torsion,OriginalPaper,"A common solution in foreign worldwide practice is the use of crane beams without brake bracing structures or only with braces to the upper flange of the beam in the support zones. In this case, when lateral forces from the crane act on the thin-walled crane beam of an open profile (as usual it is I-beam), it experiences restrained torsion, and requires a special approach for the analysis of its stress–strain state. The article considers the calculation of a crane I-beam without a brake structure and with braces to the upper chord in the support zones. It is shown that the account of restraint torsion for a free I-section crane beam is mandatory. For this case of combined bending and restraint torsion of the beam, finite element analysis with the use for modeling of the beam either simple beam finite elements with 7 degrees of freedom or plate elements shows the most accurate results. In addition, for engineering analysis, it is possible to use a modified beam model using finite elements with 6 degrees of freedom, the calculation results of which turned out to be quite close to the theoretical ones. It is shown that the braces in the supporting zones fix the beam from torsion quite well, allow reducing stresses and beam deformability, and can be used for beams for light-duty cranes with small load capacity. For medium and heavy duty cranes, such solutions are not recommended due to the possibility of fatigue failure of the beam, and full-length brake structures should be provided along the upper flange of the beam.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Construction Management', 'Sustainable Development', 'Regional/Spatial Science']"

Sukuk issuance continues by states and corporates alike. Sukuk serves two purposes. That is to say, the issuers of Sukuk aim at diversifying the sources of funds, especially under difficult economic situations. Meanwhile, investor demand remains intact due to the shortage of new Sukuk supply and the global quest for profit. While Sukuk usually enjoys healthy annual yields, also it is unlikely to default. Compared to overall issuances by the end of 2021, the defaulted Sukuk stands at a meagre rate of 0.27%, making it an attractive and secure financial instrument. Therefore, Sukuk issuance becomes part of the value proposition of world financial centres such as the U.K., Luxembourg, Hong Kong, and others. This paper analysis Sukuk’s impact on the country’s economic development by focusing on specific countries with different economic-financial experiences. Furthermore, it will investigate the feasibility of Sukuk in supporting diverse sources of funds and liquidity. In addition, this paper examines the role of Sukuk in achieving economic growth and development post-Covid pandemic. It also attempts to ascertain the critical phases of economic growth and links them to Sukuk in order to assess the effectiveness and significance of Sukuk in being a potential financial instrument that could support the economies in the post-Covid period.","['Engineering', 'Control and Systems Theory', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Sustainable Development']"

Multi-dimensional injury-related data are captured in computerized systems at hospital emergency Emergencies rooms in various fields such as the presenting problem/triage text (or injury narrative Narratives ), injury diagnosis, location of the injury, external cause of injury and activity at the time of the accident. The external cause of injury code (E-code), which plays a significant role in injury surveillance, is typically assigned by human coders based on the case information collected at hospitals. Machine learning models trained on manually coded past data can predict E-codes based on the injury information captured in fields mentioned above and thus help human coders in the form of a semi-automated decision support system. Previous studies have examined the prediction performance of various machine learning models for predicting E-codes based on injury narratives Narratives , but they have not studied the performance of Bayesian Networks to predict E-codes based on the collective information available in different fields. In this study, we examined the prediction performance of multiple Bayesian Networks developed using various fields of injury-related data. Our results indicate that (a) the Bayesian Networks combining the information available from the narrative Narratives text with other fields results in better prediction performance as compared to prediction based on narrative Narratives alone, and (b) the prediction performance of Bayesian Network that used coder assigned values to the fields Mechanism of Injury (MEI) and Major Injury Factor (MIF) was better than the Bayesian Network that used narrative Narratives -based predicted values of MEI and MIF.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Robotics and Automation', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Artificial Intelligence']"
