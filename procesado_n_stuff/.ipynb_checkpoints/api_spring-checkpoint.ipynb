       "  'abstract': 'The concept of a space solar power station (SSPS) was proposed in 1968 as a potential approach for solving the energy crisis. In the past 50 years, several structural concepts have been proposed, but none have been sent into orbit. One of the main challenges of the SSPS is dynamic behavior prediction, which can supply the necessary information for control strategy design. The ultra-large size of the SSPS causes difficulties in its dynamic analysis, such as the ultra-low vibration frequency and large flexibility. In this paper, four approaches for the numerical analysis of the dynamic problems associated with the SSPS are reviewed: the finite element, absolute nodal coordinate, floating frame formulation, and structure-preserving methods. Both the merits and shortcomings of the above four approaches are introduced when they are employed in dynamic problems associated with the SSPS. Synthesizing the merits of the aforementioned four approaches, we believe that embedding the structure-preserving method into finite element software may be an effective way to perform a numerical analysis of the dynamic problems associated with the SSPS.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'To study the effects of combined Cd and Cu pollution on rhizosphere bacterial community. High-throughput sequencing was used to examine the response of rhizosphere bacterial communities to heavy-metal stress under single and mixed pollution of cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu). With additions of Cd and Cu, the mean diversity index of rhizosphere bacterial community was in the order Cu alone > Cd-Cu mixtures > Cd alone. In all Cd and Cu treatments, the dominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Acidobacteria. In the additions with different concentrations of Cd-Cu mixtures, LEfSe indicated that there were differences in the predominant species of rhizosphere bacterial communities. Some genera such as Streptomyces and Microbacterium belonging to Actinobacteria as biomarkers were significantly enriched in both control and treatments, while some genera such as Pseudoxanthomonas and Rhodopseudomonas belonging to Proteobacteria as biomarkers were observed to be enriched in the additions with single and mixture of Cd and Cu. According to the Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis, the structure of rhizosphere bacterial community was different between treatments and the CK. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) showed that there were significant differences among treatments ( p < 0.01), and that the addition of Cu might be the primary factor affecting the composition of rhizosphere bacterial communities.',\n",

One such technology that is widely used in biomedicine and similar research fields, microfluidics, poses significant benefits for soil research; however, this technology is still underutilized in the field. Microfluidics offers unparalleled opportunities in soil bacterial cultivation, observation, and manipulation when compared to conventional approaches to these tasks. This review focuses on the use of microfluidics for bacteria research and, where possible, pulls from examples in the literature where the technologies were used for soil related research. The review also provides commentary on the use of microfluidics for soil bacteria research and discusses the key challenges researchers face when implementing this technology. We believe that microfluidic chips and their associated auxiliary technologies provide a prime inroad into the future of soil science research.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Soils are impacted globally by several anthropogenic factors, including chemical pollutants. Among those, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are of concern due to their high environmental persistence, and as they might affect soil structure and function. However, data on impacts of PFAS on soil structure and microbially-driven processes are currently lacking. This study explored the effects of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) at environmental-relevant concentrations on soil health, using a 6-week microcosm experiment. PFAS (even at 0.5 ng g −1 for PFBS) significantly increased litter decomposition, associated with positive effects on β-glucosidase activities. This effect increased with PFAS concentrations. Soil pH was significantly increased, likely as a direct consequence of increased litter decomposition affected by PFAS. Soil respiration was significantly inhibited by PFAS in week 3, while this effect was more variable in week 6. Water-stable aggregates were negatively affected by PFOS, possibly related to microbial shifts. PFAS affected soil bacterial and fungal abundance, but not microbial and certain enzyme activities. Our work highlights the potential effects of PFAS on soil health, and we argue that this substance class could be a factor of environmental change of potentially broad relevance in terrestrial ecosystem functioning.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Lead (Pb) pollution is one of the most widespread and harmful environmental problems worldwide. Determination of changes in soil properties and microbial functional diversity due to land use is needed to establish a basis for remediation of soil pollution. This study aimed to investigate soils contaminated by Pb from different sources and to analyze the functional diversity and metabolism of soil microbial communities using Biolog technology. Pb pollution (>300 mg kg −1 ) significantly influenced the diversity and metabolic functions of soil microbial communities. Specifically, Pb contamination significantly reduced soil microbial biomass carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) levels and catalase activity while increasing invertase activity. Furthermore, Biolog EcoPlate assays revealed that Pb pollution reduced the general activities of soil microorganisms, suppressing their ability to utilize C sources. In Pb-contaminated areas lacking vegetation cover, Shannon, Simpson, and McIntosh diversity indices of soil microorganisms were significantly reduced. The microbial diversity and biomass C and N levels were affected by land use and soil properties, respectively, whereas soil enzyme activity was primarily affected by the interaction between land use and soil properties. Our results provide a reference and a theoretical basis for developing soil quality evaluation and remediation strategies.',\n",

However, at present, little is known about the impact of residual chlorine on the soil micro-ecological environment. Herein, we treated an experimental soil-plant-microbiome microcosm system by continuous irrigation with a low concentration of chlorine-containing water, and then analyzed the influence on the soil microbial community using metagenomics. After 14-d continuous chlorine treatment, there were no significant lasting effect on soil microbial community diversity and composition either in the rhizosphere or in bulk soil. Although metabolic functions of the rhizosphere microbial community were affected slightly by continuous chlorine treatment, it recovered to the original status. The abundance of several resistance genes changed by 7 d and recovered by 14 d. According to our results, the chlorine residue resulting from daily disinfection may present a slight long-term effect on plant growth (shoot length and fresh weight) and soil micro-ecology. In general, our study assisted with environmental risk assessments relating to the application ofchlorine-containing disinfectants and minimization of risks to the environment during disease control, such as COVID-19.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Both fertilizer and plant species richness may affect the soil nematode community. However, the influence of fertilizer and weed species richness interaction is unclear. Nematode abundance and biodiversity in wheat and weed plots soil treated with nitrogen, phosphate and potassium fertilizer addition and weed species richness (0, 1, 2 and 4 weed levels) were investigated in a long-term microcosm experiment established in 2010 at Kaifeng, China. The results demonstrated that fertilizer treatment increased the abundance of total nematode, bacterivores, and plant parasites whereas it decreased the total genera number, the Shannon—Wiener diversity index (H′), Margalef richness index (SR), the total maturity index (ΣMI), and structure index (SI), and degraded the structure of the nematode community. In contrast, weed species richness increased these ecological indices and enhanced the structure of the nematode community. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the fertilizer’s effect was more significant than weed species richness. Redundancy analysis (RDA) demonstrated that fertilizer affected soil nematode mainly through increasing soil available phosphorus by 4.71 times and ammonium nitrogen content by 74.03%; weed species richness increased the diversity indices of soil nematode mainly through enhancing soil moisture by 2.07%. Our results suggest weed species richness may relieve the negative effect of fertilizer on the diversity of soil nematode community.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Secondary metabolites (SMs) produced by soil bacteria, for instance antimicrobials and siderophores, play a vital role in bacterial adaptation to soil and root ecosystems and can contribute to plant health. Many SMs are non-ribosomal peptides and polyketides, assembled by non-ribosomal peptides synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) and encoded by biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Despite their ecological importance, little is known about the occurrence and diversity of NRPs and PKs in soil. We extracted NRPS- and PKS-encoding BGCs from 20 publicly available soil and root-associated metagenomes and annotated them using antiSMASH-DB. We found that the overall abundance of NRPSs and PKSs is similar in both environments, however NRPSs and PKSs were significantly clustered between soil and root samples. Moreover, the majority of identified sequences were unique to either soil- or root-associated datasets and had low identity to known BGCs, suggesting their novelty. Overall, this study illuminates the huge untapped diversity of predicted SMs in soil and root microbiomes, and indicates presence of specific SMs, which may play a role in inter- and intra-bacterial interactions in root ecosystems.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Sugars are frequently and abundantly found in root exudates, but influence of specific sugars on the fate of soil-borne pathogens, microbiome structure, and particularly microbial interactions are not well understood. A 42-day of microcosm incubation was conducted with two soils: a natural watermelon Fusarium wilt pathogen (i.e., Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (FON))-infested soil (Low-FON soil) and the soil further receiving the wilt pathogen inocula (High-FON soil). Both soils were supplemented with four simple sugars before incubation. The results show that, in both soils, FON was enriched by all sugars although co-living with tremendously diverse microbes; and bacterial richness, evenness, and diversity were decreased and bacterial community structure was changed by all sugars. Bacterial richness and evenness were negatively correlated with FON quantity in both Low-FON and High-FON soils, indicating that FON may tend to live in soil with low alpha-diversity. In both Low-FON and High-FON soils, the sugar-spiked networks had more links, higher density, larger modules, and shorter harmonic geodesic distance, suggesting greater potentials for microbial interaction and niche-sharing. The positive links between some of the keystone taxa and FON indicates that these keystone taxa may have promoted FON. This may be one of reasons why FON could proliferate vigorously after sugar supplementation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Arsenic (As) is broadly distributed due to natural and anthropogenic sources, and it is toxic to organisms. This study aimed to investigate the proteomic response in earthworm exposed to As 3+ . Earthworms were exposed to As 3+ in soil at 5–80 mg kg −1 , and samples were collected after 60 days exposure. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to separate the proteins in earthworm homogenate, then differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified using MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS analysis. After2-DE, 36 DEPs were found and 24 of them were successfully identified. 79.2% of DEPs were upregulated compared to the control group. The maximum fold change reached 53.8 in spot 3108 in the 80 mg kg −1 As group. Two proteins were not found in the control group but found in the As treated groups. Proteins were grouped into metabolism, signal transduction, stress-related, transport, regulation, and predicted/hypothetical protein categories based on their function. The protein—protein interaction between the DEPs indicated that serum albumin (ALB) is very important, related to 6 other proteins. Proteins were then verified by western blot, the results were in agreement with the proteomic analyses. The identification of induced or repressed proteins because of As 3+ in earthworms is helpful to explore the underlying mechanisms of soil arsenic ecotoxicity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In most bonding processes, an adhesive is applied to a substrate in a specific pattern before the second substrate is subsequently pressed against it. During this, the adhesive flows in such a way that, ideally, it completely fills the joint. In practice, however, areas with entrapped air frequently remain in the bonded adhesive layer. Within the scope of a research project, these flows are systematically analyzed in order to identify optimal initial application patterns for the adhesive and substrate geometry to minimise such risks. For this purpose, the authors use an efficient flow model, the partially filled gaps model (PFGM), extended in this study to include the functionality of trapped air pockets. Depending on the volume fractions of air and adhesive, the flow of both phases is computed. Therefore, the model is introduced and fully described, benchmarked with respect to its plausibility and functionality, and results obtained are compared with a CFD calculation. Thereafter, the functionality of openings and closings of the pockets are analyzed. Lastly, the model is then applied to a real scenario created with a Hele–Shaw cell measurement. The benchmark as well as the comparison with the measurement results show the high potential of this technique.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'High-throughput sequencing technology is increasingly used in the study of nematode biodiversity. However, the annotation difference of commonly used primers and reference databases on nematode community is still unclear. We compared two pairs of primers (3NDf/C_1132rmod, NF1F/18Sr2bR) and three databases (NT_v20200604, SILVA138/18s Eukaryota and PR2_v4.5 databases) on the determination of nematode community from four different vegetation types in Changbai Mountain, including mixed broadleaf-conifer forest, dark coniferous forest, betula ermanii Cham and alpine tundra. Our results showed that the selection of different primers and databases influenced the annotation of nematode taxa, but the diversity of nematode community showed consistent pattern among different vegetation types. Our findings emphasize that it is necessary to select appropriate primer and database according to the target taxonomic level. The difference in primers will affect the result of nematode taxa at different classification levels, so sequencing analysis cannot be used for comparison with studies using different primers. In terms of annotation effect in this study, 3NDf/C_1132rmod primers with NT_v20200604 database could provide more information than other combinations at the genus or species levels.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The computational modelling of soot formation and destruction during the combustion process is one of the most challenging topics in combustion research. This paper reviews the numerical soot models constructed at different length scales, including macroscale, mesoscale, and microscale. The four key stages of soot evolution, including nucleation, surface growth and coagulation, agglomeration, and oxidation, are first described with the generally accepted mathematical formulations in each stage explained. Different computational frameworks and their pros and cons are then reviewed, including the one-equation empirical soot model (macroscale), two-equation semi-empirical soot model (macroscale), different variations of population balance model (mesoscale), discrete element model (microscale), and molecular dynamics model (microscale). It is concluded that the accuracy required and the computational cost available are the two major influencing factors to be considered when selecting the appropriate computational model. The user needs to assess the priorities in their specific application and evaluate different modelling options to find the optimal balance between the level of accuracy and computation resources required.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The community composition and activity-density of termites can influence nutrient cycling and other ecological functions. However, the spatial distribution and the activity-density of termites on a fine-scale in tropical forests are still unknown. We checked the spatial distribution patterns of the feeding groups and species of termites and their co-occurrence pattern in a 1-ha (100 m × 100 m) plot, and their correlation with the environmental factors. We used a standard protocol to collect termite assemblages and classified them into five feeding groups based on their preferred diet: fungus growers, litter feeders, soil feeders, soil-wood feeders, and wood feeders. We measured the environmental factors: soil pH, litter mass, aboveground plant biomass, and topographic position index (TPI). Soil-wood feeders showed the highest activity-density, followed by wood feeders, fungus growers, soil feeders, and litter feeders. Soil-wood feeders and fungus growers demonstated a strong correlation while litter feeders showed weak correlations with other feeding groups. Termite feeding groups and most of the termite species displayed a positive association with the high TPI and the low soil pH patches. Our results indicated that the examined environmental factors influenced the termite community assemblages and distribution patterns on a fine-scale in tropical rainforests.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Since the coronavirus disease 2019, the extended time indoors makes people more concerned about indoor air quality, while the increased ventilation in seeks of reducing infection probability has increased the energy usage from heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems. In this study, to represent the dynamics of indoor temperature and air quality, a coupled grey-box model is developed. The model is identified and validated using a data-driven approach and real-time measured data of a campus office. To manage building energy usage and indoor air quality, a model predictive control strategy is proposed and developed. The simulation study demonstrated 18.92% energy saving while maintaining good indoor air quality at the testing site. Two nationwide simulation studies assessed the overall energy saving potential and the impact on the infection probability of the proposed strategy in different climate zones. The results showed 20%–40% energy saving in general while maintaining a predetermined indoor air quality setpoint. Although the infection risk is increased due to the reduced ventilation rate, it is still less than the suggested threshold (2%) in general.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Skygardens or skycourts are a unique architectural intervention in the built environment, enhancing the social, economic, and environmental values of the building. It allows occupants to connect and experience outdoor freshness within a semi-enclosed environment. However, skygardens located on a highrise building may generate intense wind gusts, endangering the safety of occupants. Using a validated computational fluid dynamics model, this study investigates the potential of various vegetative barriers or shelterbelts in attenuating the high wind speeds encountered in such spaces and the impact on wind and thermal comfort. Three skygarden configurations were investigated with and without vegetative barriers, simplified and modelled as porous zones, and their effect was studied on the velocity and temperature profile at the occupants’ level. The results indicate that while hedges and trees can offer resistance to airflow, trees provide higher temperature reduction. However, a combination of vegetative and geometrical barriers provides the most optimal condition in the skygarden. The study has identified the importance of assessing wind attenuation characteristics of tree plantations on highrise skygarden, and the results can be used in designing intervention strategies. Moreover, vegetation can attenuate pollutants and mitigate poor air quality by surface deposition, and future studies should investigate in that direction.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'For years, friction-induced vibration and noise (FIVN) has puzzled many researchers in academia and industry. Several mechanisms have been proposed for explaining its occurrence and quantifying its frequencies, notably for automotive brake squeal, clutch squeal, and even rail corrugation. However, due to the complex and complicated nature of FIVN, there is not yet one fundamental mechanism that can explain all phenomena of FIVN. Based on experimental results obtained on a simple test structure and corresponding numerical validation using both complex eigenvalue analysis (CEA) and transient dynamic analysis (TDA), this study attempts to propose a new fundamental mechanism for FIVN, which is the repeated cycles of partial detachment and then reattachment of the contact surfaces. Since friction is ubiquitous and FIVN is very common, the insight into FIVN reported in this paper is highly significant and will help establish effective means to control FIVN in engineering and daily life.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Flexible microporous metal rubber (FMP-MR) is a high-damping material that dissipates energy by dry friction through internal spiral metal wires in contact with each other. However, the FMP-MR energy dissipation mechanism is not fully understood owing to its disordered grid interpenetrating structure. In this work, computer-aided preparation technology is used to accurately reconstruct the complex spiral network structure of FMP-MR multipoint random contact, and a cell group model with an energy dissipation mechanism is proposed to obtain the dynamic energy distribution of the contact friction in both space and time dimensions. By judging the effective contact point, a global displacement ablation phenomenon of hooked staggered porous materials is induced. The macro- and micro-equivalent frictions are introduced to effectively explain the characteristics of the strong energy dissipation in FMP-MR under fretting excitation. A real and effective damping hysteresis constitutive model is then constructed to dynamically capture the mapping relationship between the complex nonlinear topological structure effect of the materials and spatial random contact dry friction in real time. The results indicate that the contact behavior between turns of the FMP-MR wire follows a clear quasi-Gaussian distribution under an external load, forcing the topological results to change. The energy dissipation of the materials revealed peak energy consumption lagging behind the loading limit for a certain distance, which can be determined by the effective contact point and contact dry friction slip. The consistency between the quasi-static compression tests and constitutive curves of the model was quantitatively verified through residual analysis. The data demonstrated the differential behavior of the FMP-MR meso-structure to follow a phased growth law during loading with different action mechanisms in the guiding, main growth, and relaxation stages of the energy consumption displacement curve. In summary, these findings provide an acceptable theoretical basis for the damping energy consumption mechanism and lifetime prediction of FMP-MR.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This chapter identifies the overall trends in Japan’s official development assistance (ODA) policies for the health sector in developing countries from 1990 to 2020 and its future post-COVID-19 prospects. Since the end of the Cold War, watershed events have repeatedly changed the landscape of international cooperation in the health sector. Like other international aid donors, Japan has devised priorities and strategies for ODA based on a set of international and domestic factors in a constantly changing world. Numerous studies on Japan’s ODA have examined international and domestic factors that impact the formulation of the country’s aid policy. This chapter aims to add to those studies by combining recent debates on international cooperation and foreign aid, the right to health, and world health system reforms to explore and analyze Japan’s ODA for health in developing countries. The guiding research questions were as follows: What were the major trends in Japan’s ODA policies in the health sector from 1990 to 2020? Which international health debates and international cooperation factors exerted influence on those trends? What are the prospects of Japan’s ODA given the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts? The research relied on primary sources, specifically Japan’s ODA official documents and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) ODA quantitative databases, as well as secondary sources, such as academic literature on international cooperation and foreign aid for health. Our preliminary findings revealed that Japan’s ODA in the health sector from 1990 to 2020 centered on two main axes: infectious diseases and maternal and child health, both of which are oriented toward strengthening the healthcare system. Given this goal, it seems relevant to consider that Japan’s health system is based on the assumption of the need to provide universal health coverage, a concept currently supported by the World Health Organization (WHO), in contrast to the universal health system, and that the implications of this choice on Japan’s ODA and developing countries’ health policies are yet to be fully understood. The COVID-19 pandemic has put substantial pressure on health systems globally and international cooperation for health; thus, it has the potential to affect and even change Japan’s ODA for the health sector in developing countries.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Depression is frequent in the general population and among people who attend primary health-care clinics. Therefore, primary health-care clinicians play an essential role in providing timely and quality depression care, including the detection, diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and referral of depressed patients. However, depression is usually underdiagnosed and undertreated in primary health care, with structural, organizational, provider, and patient barriers. Several studies have demonstrated that psychosocial, psychological, and pharmacological interventions for depression are feasible and effective in primary health-care settings. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have consistently found that combined interventions, provided in a stepped-care manner, under a team-driven approach, and accompanied by system-level improvements, are the most effective. Although most of the evidence comes from developed countries, packages of low-resource interventions for depression have been proposed for developing nations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Scholarship from policy studies and political science provides insights into how different communities coalesce around issues, attempt to communicate their evidence and arguments, and the potential institutional aides and barriers to this. But applying this literature to a process as broad and diverse as the SDG negotiations, within an institutional setting as large as the UNGA, is very hard. Thousands of people provided input, in one way or another, to the post-2015 deliberations and each goal area (as well as the many topics that did not become goals) enjoyed lengthy debates both inside of and outside of the formal deliberation chambers, suggesting there is not one objective evidence to policy process which needs to be understood but instead a wide range of processes across different sectors and scales.\\xa0To help focus this analysis and to provide an inter-sectoral perspective on these processes, Part 3 focuses on three very diverse themes of the debate; health, urban sustainability, and data. I trace the key conceptual issues that were under discussion within each, noting the topics under debate and the supporters and adversaries of each. This kind of detailed thematic analysis is essential to understand the nuances of negotiations and how broad issues are translated into given words, phrases and ideas eventually featured in outcome documents. It also helps identify what, if any, where the key entry points for scientists and academics to provide their evidence. Finally, mapping the transmission of ideas and concepts also enables the identification of consensus-building processes that helped actors in each epistemic community to coalesce around priority themes and to forge political consensus on the eventual wording.',\n",

However, within this rapidly expanding field, the role of social workers has often not been sufficiently highlighted. This chapter will discuss how social workers can and should play an integral role in the holistic delivery of clinical and community care for refugees living with emotional distress and mental health conditions. Methodologies derived from social work are essential for MHPSS programs. In particular, the chapter will discuss the following: (1) how the holistic training of social workers provides practitioners with unique skills to work with people with severe and complex mental health issues; (2) how social work principles provide foundation to MHPSS case management, with examples of their application, using existing process and tools, to refugee response settings in low- and middle-income countries; (3) the significant role of building capacity of social workers to offer focused psychosocial support within an MHPSS system, using scalable psychological interventions; and (4) how clinical approaches to MHPSS must be balanced by empowering approaches that strengthen community participation and agency, explicitly linking this to current and older debates about MHPSS.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Only 6.6% of Malaysian adults were found to have an adequate level of health literacy, though it can be considered as one of the most crucial and basic knowledge that should be possessed by every individual. Expected to be sick at least once in a lifetime, pressuring Malaysians to be literate about their health. It was known to the world of health-related research that this health literacy may help the individuals to competently communicate their health conditions to the healthcare providers, signifying the importance of this study to be conducted. This study applied a cross-sectional study design, was conducted to investigate the relationship between the domains of health literacy which comprised of health care, disease prevention and health promotion towards B40 Kelantanese health communication competence. By using a quota sampling, a total of 100 B40 Kelantanese from Kota Bharu and Bachok districts were approached, and each of the district was represented by 50 respondents. A set of self-administered questionnaires was used during the physical, face to face data collection process. The results from the correlational analysis revealed that there were significant strong positive relationships between domains of health literacy towards the Kota Bharu urban community’s health communication competence, while in Bachok, the strength of the relationships was moderate. Other than that, multiple regression analysis has also shown the opposing findings on the influence of health literacy towards the health communication competence. For Bachok, none of the independent variable can predict the communication competence while for Kota Bharu, the results showed otherwise. Health care and health promotion were the domains that can affect the health communication competence among Kelantanese who live in Kota Bharu, leaving the domain of disease prevention as a non-predictor. Furthermore, a few recommendations have been suggested for the respective District and State Health Departments as well as suggestions for future researchers.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The aspiration of the Goal 3 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages” is derived from both the “right to health” Right to health norm in the field of international human rights and the “health for all (HFA)” goal in the field of international development. The principle of “Leave no one behind” in achieving the SDGs is logically endorsed both by the right to health Right to health and the HFA. First, communicable diseases have become perceived as a threat to “human security” Human security in global health, and Japan started to use the concept in global health diplomacy Global health diplomacy to elevate the level of dialogues. Nevertheless, Ebola Virus Disease Ebola Virus Disease and COVID-19 COVID-19 , not anticipated when the SDGs were adopted, now urge us to re-visit the needs to reform global health governance. Second, to promote universal health coverage (UHC) Universal Health Coverage (UHC) , international partnership has been strengthened. In 2019, at the G20 Summit, Japan played an important role in promoting the UHC Universal Health Coverage (UHC) among the twenty members. This led to an expanded international commitment made at UN High-Level Meeting on UHC in the same year. It shows that global health has become an important agenda for diplomacy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Globally,\\xa0there is a significant gap between what is known and what is done\\xa0in prevention and treatment for depression in children, adolescents and youths. Evidence-based strategies that surmount the barriers to the provision of mental healthcare are essential to improve the lives of those affected by depression. This chapter provides a review of innovative strategies to diminish the prevention and treatment gap for depression in children, adolescents, and youths. It presents recent evidence related to the feasibility of implementation and efficacy for innovation cases that show promise for building clinical capacity and expanding mental health coverage to improve prevention and treatment for depression: (1) integration of mental health services into primary care; (2) task shifting and training of nonspecialists in mental healthcare; and (3) innovative use of technological platforms to enhance access, cut costs, and reduce stigma. Regardless of the evidence that supports the viability of these models, it is important to test their attainability, agreeableness, utility, and adequacy in different settings, including low- and middle-income countries. In addition, these advances require political support, to be effectively implemented and scaled up to such an extent that they meaningfully affect the burden of disease in children, adolescents, and youths with depression around the world.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Over the past two decades in Australia, the number of mentally ill individuals killed by police firearms annually has remained relatively constant, despite variances in the total number of people fatally shot by police in any given year. For every critical incident of this kind, there are many more police-involved mental health crisis interventions that occur in the community which are successfully de-escalated and safely resolved without the need for police use of force. But by virtue of their circumstances, fatal mental health crisis interventions attract the greater proportion of media attention and public and political scrutiny, and with good reason. Given that the highest calling of police duty is to protect life, it is only appropriate that after a critical incident of this kind consideration is given to whether there was not some other way the situation could have been resolved. Less examined is how these civilian deaths have become something of a marketing opportunity for police technology companies, with large investments made into alternatives to police firearms, based on the assumption that less-lethal tactical options will reduce the number of fatalities and provide a technological ‘fix’ to the perceived crisis in police legitimacy. This chapter addresses the complexities of fatal police-citizen encounters involving mental illness, the ways in which they are typically covered in news media, and the ‘solutions’ that have been sought to prevent the police use of lethal force. The chapter asks what could be done better in relation to mental health crises in the community, examining more recent attempts in Australia to reframe the response as one that should be led by health professionals rather than police.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Health literacy has become a priority for the well-being of individuals and society. Despite the implementation of public policies aimed at its formalization in the educational structure, and the promotion of technological development and the digital ecosystem, the new generations have not been actively involved. The incorporation of playful elements has a dynamic effect on literacy processes, promoting the development of skills and competencies that influence learning. Through a systematic review (PRISMA-P) of the scientific literature on health literacy and its relationship with games, this article provides a specific and structured synthesis of the empirical studies published in the last 10\\xa0years, identifying contributions and patterns between multidisciplinary contributions, with a particular focus on the combination between gamification and serious games. We concluded that immersion in a playful experience favors the emotional and cognitive learning of the player. The simulated reality of serious games and the gamification of activities can help understand health information, generating direct benefits through risk reduction, adoption of healthy habits and lifestyles.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'There are many and various connections between mental illness and employment. This chapter will begin with an overview of mental illness and the main links with employment. The self-selection or social drift hypothesis suggests that people with mental illness face higher risks of employment difficulties due to various disadvantages. The social causation hypothesis suggests that certain characteristics of workplaces can trigger or worsen mental illness. The relevance of these explanations depends on the type of mental illness that is being considered. Using common mental disorders, psychotic disorders, and youth mental health as examples, the evidence relating to these arguments is illustrated. Responses to them include anti-stigma campaigns, early intervention for mental illness, supported employment models, workplace awareness, stress alleviation and general well-being programs, occupational health interventions, and policies targeting employment practices. Mental illness and employment are also indirectly linked through their impacts on carers (caregivers), family members, and colleagues. Evidence on these links and responses comes mainly from high-income countries, and a great deal remains unknown in low- and middle-income countries. The COVID-19 pandemic brought further uncertainties regarding macroeconomic recession and new work practices, affecting jobs and employee mental health. This chapter highlights key evidence (and knowledge gaps) on the links between mental illness and various facets of employment to help decision-makers prioritize appropriate actions to the benefit of individuals, employers, wider society, and the national economy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Possible relations between religion, spirituality, positive psychology, and physical health have interested humans throughout history. Only recently have these relations become the object of scientific study. In this chapter, we conducted a nonsystematic, narrative review of the modest but growing empirical literature, which suggests that positive psychological constructs such as life satisfaction, positive affect, purpose/meaning, and optimism are generally predictive of better physical health and functioning. Similarly, religion and spirituality (R/S) variables including religious service attendance, religious/spiritual coping, religious orientation, and prayer have demonstrated relations with better health outcomes. These relations are sometimes complex and possibly influenced by methodological considerations. Several possible pathways to account for these relationships have been proposed, including behavioral processes, social support, and direct physiological pathways. Whether these relations are causal remains a perplexing question to resolve, due to methodological challenges inherent in the nature of the variables themselves and to the practical difficulties of examining these variables via experimental investigation and longitudinal analysis. The possibility that positive psychology constructs may account for associations between R/S and health deserves further exploration, ideally using experimental and prospective longitudinal methods.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Youth depression has been linked to a lower standard of living, poorer mental health in adulthood, and even suicide. Therefore, effective prevention and treatment of depression in this population is a global health concern. However, there is a significant gap between evidence-based interventions and those applied in the real world. The use of digital technologies as an alternative or adjunct to conventional mental health services has the potential to promote the integration of evidence-based interventions in real-world settings and increase prevention and treatment access for underserved populations. Current evidence shows promising results on the efficacy of these interventions in youth. However, these interventions are not without limitations and challenges, such as adherence and acceptability issues. In addition, there are currently several gaps in the research and evidence for these interventions, limiting their use and application on a larger scale. Therefore, for digital interventions to reach their full potential, more research and development are required, especially in the young population.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Medicine has evolved over time, shifting from disease, illness, and injury treatment to preventive health. This chapter focuses on several domains of physician health and wellness, including general health and clinical preventive care and three preventive health behaviors: nutrition, exercise, and sleep. Within each domain, published data on US physicians are summarized and when possible, data on the US population are provided for context. The associations of each domain with pediatrician well-being are discussed, along with barriers to preventive care and preventive health behaviors. Lastly, relevant 2019 data from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Pediatrician Life and Career Experience Study (PLACES) are presented. Based on the limited data available, physicians seem relatively healthy and exhibit healthy behaviors, although there is room for improvement. Modifiable systemic and organizational barriers exist.

       "  'abstract': 'Ageing and urbanisation pose significant challenges for public health and urban planning. Ageing populations are at particular risk from hazards arising from urbanisation processes, some of which are in turn exacerbated by climate change. One approach for mitigating the negative effects of urbanisation on ageing populations is the leveraging of the beneficial effects of urban green infrastructure as a public health intervention in the planning process.\\xa0We assessed the potential of available theoretical frameworks to provide the context for such leverage. This involved active engagement with academics and practitioners specialising in ageing, green infrastructure and health and well-being through a knowledge-brokering approach. We concluded that an integrated and comprehensive framework on the socio-cultural-ecological determinants of health is lacking. To address this, we present a set of principles for overcoming challenges to knowledge integration when working at the intersection of green infrastructure, ageing, health and well-being. Our findings—and the co-production process used to generate them—have wider significance for trans-disciplinary research into the benefits of the natural environment to human health and well-being as well as other complex and interconnected topics associated with global grand challenges.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Healthcare service providers face with an ever increasing demand as an inevitable consequence of changing epidemiological and demographic dynamics. Increasing longevity is accompanied by rising morbidity levels such that people are living longer but unhealthier. Healthcare service providers try to keep up with the current trend against the backdrop of limited resources. They also encounter new challenges that stem from altering lifestyles of patients. Patients very often opt for on-demand healthcare services. As an answer to this multifaceted problem, healthcare service providers are in search of contemporary ways that are more efficient and effective. That being the case, common practices cover digitalization of services, creation of new channels to get in\\xa0touch with patients and integration of healthcare services in an innovative way so that extra room could be spared for increasing demand. Behind the scenes, there is a data deluge in innovative healthcare services by the virtue of digitalization. This fact provokes data driven models that would enable healthcare practitioners to make informed decisions, both at systems and patient level. This book chapter addresses the motives and practices of digital health and elaborates on the contributions of digitalization in healthcare sector from a modeler’s perspective.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Most students in higher education are in the so-called “emerging adulthood” period, which is a critical phase that coincides with the age of onset of most mental disorders. Mental health problems in higher education students have been associated with negative impacts on youth development, poorer academic performance, and higher dropout rates, as well as a negative impact on subsequent functioning in the labor market. Although higher education institutions have developed specific strategies to address the mental health of their students, there is still a significant gap in prevention and early treatment. Moreover, given the high prevalence of mental health problems in higher education students, these institutions are unlikely to have sufficient resources to meet the needs for mental health services. Internet-based interventions may be particularly beneficial in overcoming logistical and financial barriers to health services and hold promise for low-cost interventions with positive outcomes. These interventions allow flexible use of available resources, without time and location constraints, enabling rapid scale-up of prevention and treatment programs, in contrast to face-to-face care. In addition, their relative anonymity and privacy reduce the stigma of receiving treatment for depression. Although the accumulating evidence on the use of these technologies to prevent or treat depression in higher education students shows promising results, significant challenges remain.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'As with Chap. 6 , this chapter starts with sociability as one of the six ontological features of the human condition, identified in Chap. 2 , via The Ontology of Well-Being Thesis (TOWT), and defended throughout the book. The argument here maintains an important sociological distinction between the social causation and the social construction of mental health/illness. The socially causation of mental health, focuses on its social epidemiology, so on what kind of social determinants lead to or produce mental health/illness. Whereas the social construction of mental health/illness focuses on how notions of illness, health and care are ‘given meaning’ within and between societies, so on those social determinants that socially define certain people as mentally ill, which, in turn, affects how this group is publicly viewed and treated. Drawing from this sociological distinction, the main claim here is that promoting mental health must accommodate the six ontological features of the human condition identified in Chap. 2 , and in TOWT – these features being, in no prioritised order, human embodiment , finiteness , sociability , cognition , evaluation , and agency . Therefore, when exploring the social causation and social construction of mental health/illness, any epistemological and normative implications for people diagnosed as mentally ill must, in some way, reflect these ontological features. For example, the claim here is that a person who is socially constructed as ‘mentally ill’ should also be viewed publicly as someone who can exercise agency , cognition , and evaluation . That is, with these features underpinning a non-determinist epistemological and normative account of mental health/illness and well-being. The further argument is that this account should be central to the co-productive development of mental health policies and practices (notably concerning the practice of social prescription), so opening-up new ways for viewing and treating those people who are socially constructed as ‘mentally ill’.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Increasing urbanization, current crises, and uncertain times pose an exponential threat to mental health, particularly for children and adolescents who are in their development. There is an urgent need to promote avenues of well-being at the individual and collective levels. Contemplative practices aim to cultivate awareness and connection as a means to alleviate human suffering and the chronic consequences of stress. More specifically, nature-based interventions are gaining interest and showing promising benefits in clinical and nonclinical populations. Their underlying mechanisms are multifactorial and include physical, psychological, and environmental aspects. We highlight two key contemplative factors and their contribution to mental health promotion: (1) sensory awareness of present moment experience in nature and (2) feeling of gratitude and perception of beauty. We discuss the applicability and relevance of nature contemplation in young people and its role in preventing depression.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Maternal perinatal mental health problems pose significant public health challenges worldwide. Among these problems, perinatal depression (PND) is the most common condition. PND is a devastating mental illness because it is linked to overall poor maternal health and impaired maternal functioning. The resultant difficulties in mother-to-infant bonding may hinder the quality of the mother-infant relationship, which is critical for the infant’s development and mental health. Despite its public health relevance, PND is globally both underrecognized and undertreated. Even if detected by health-care professionals, studies show low access and adherence to treatments. In this scenario, information and communication technologies have brought an opportunity to overcome logistical and economic barriers to preventing and treating PND. This chapter provides a concise overview of PND, delivers very up-to-date evidence on Internet-based interventions (IBIs) to prevent and treat PND, and discusses suggestions for future advancements in research, practice, and policy. The included learned lessons and recommendations for the field will be highly valuable not only for clinicians and researchers interested in PND IBIs but also for developing, studying, and implementing IBIs to address depression throughout the life cycle.',\n",

Despite a growing scientific knowledge on the manifold benefits of human interaction with Alpine natural resources, the health tourism potential has not yet been fully exploited by Alpine regions. Based on major push and pull factors, the current state of scientific knowledge on the healing potential of nine selected natural Alpine resources is presented and discussed with regard to their health tourism potential. Major research gaps as well as starting points for future studies are demonstrated. In this way, the present work contributes to an applicable knowledge base on the health benefits of Alpine resources to enhance regional innovation capacity in terms of sustainable health tourism development. As tourism regions are increasingly taking evidence-based approaches to health tourism and regional development, the resulting lighthouses will contribute to the positioning of the Alpine space as globally attractive healing environment.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Human flourishing is a complete state of well-being, comprised of essential elements that are universally valued across cultures as ends in themselves rather than as means to ends. Understanding the ontological interconnectedness of individual and communal flourishing has important implications for health. A narrow view of health has been framed in biomedical—and frequently physical—terms as the absence of disease or impairment. But broader and more holistic understandings derived from long-standing wisdom in the humanities are increasingly being used in tandem with the allopathic approach, thereby offering a relational understanding of health that transcends a focus on physical infirmity and locates the individual in social, ecological, and spiritual contexts. This wisdom has profound implications for the organization of healthcare, including a restoration of compassion as the heart of healthcare practice, as recent iterations of lifestyle medicine and integrative medicine have demonstrated. A synthesis of interdisciplinary knowledge affirms the goal of building a wellbeing ecosystem that transcends self-centeredness and reimagines health as flourishing.',\n",

We begin with an overview of public health’s traditional focus on health-related exposures and outcomes and then summarize growing evidence that religion and spirituality play a vital role in health and well-being. Next, we review empirical evidence suggesting associations between faith, hope, and love and subsequent health and well-being, focusing on findings from the public health literature. We reflect on what aspects of these virtues are and are not captured by current measures, as well as what might be needed to improve measurement going forward. We describe the role of religious communities in fostering these virtues in the modern context—faith in an era of an increasing sense of meaninglessness, hope in an era of increasing despair and deaths of despair, and love in an era of increasing division.

       "  'abstract': 'Nature-based health tourism is experiencing a resurgence. To determine its potential as a development opportunity for alpine destinations, it is necessary to analyse both the demand and supply side. Two surveys were conducted: a representative survey of the population of six countries of the Alpine Space exploring the perception of the Alps as a healthy destination in general and on the personal assessment of the health effect of natural resources in particular and an exploratory survey of tourism stakeholders in destination management, accommodation and gastronomy as well as (health) tourism services with a focus on the expected economic developments and the relevance of individual target groups for nature-based health tourism. The results demonstrate the need for a strategic development process which aligns perceptions with destination strategy and pre-existing offers. Two potential strategies are briefly outlined: 1. destinations with non-locally specific alpine natural health resources can develop broad tourism experiences for health conditions that occur across society with health a secondary aspect in marketing. 2. destinations featuring locally specific natural health resources with proven evidence can develop offers for a specific condition and are thus able to target a very specific group.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Access to nutrition and safe food is a key to sustaining life and promoting good health. Thus, the sustainable development goals (SDGs) reawaken the world alluding to the interweaving connects of health, nutrition, and food safety. This chapter introduces the current scenario of nutrition and food safety and how both traverse important issues in health including the trends of morbidity and mortality as well as the social determinants of health. Furthermore, key elements of nutrition and food safety will be introduced to further explicate how factors and drivers shape and influence food supply including production and access, food safety, and consumer behavior and practices. Finally, we argue how considerable efforts have been made drawing on the current context of changing nutrition and food safety driven by multiple factors embracing externalities, and endogenous factors are being contested and negotiated to make an impact on health equity at a global scale. To further the progress of the SDGs, we conclude with propositions to support international organizations, national government, and local stakeholders to work not in sectoral fragmentation, but together. With the appropriate commitment, investment, and actions at global, regional, and country level, no one will be left behind from attaining good health by reinforcing synergies and trade-offs among SDGs related to nutrition and food safety.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Evidence-based health care is a desired concept today, especially in these pandemic circumstances. However, the patients’ data are deficient, especially for patients with chronic diseases and their previous medical treatments and diagnosis if they must be treated in other institutions outside of the country of leaving or private institutions. All data for patients are stored in the institutional database as electronic health data (EHR), owned by healthcare institutions, hospitals, and medical practitioners. It is almost impossible to integrate such data because of the different low treatment of personal health data, especially when the patients are from different countries. One solution for providing evidence-based health care and medicine is creating a personal health record (PHR) owned and managed securely by the patient as a central point of the PHR data-driven integration of all data connected with the patient that are mostly heterogeneous. All data types for the patient’s health and medical condition can be integrated into cloud-based PHR owned and managed by the patient to provide their data with them where the patient resides. In addition, the lack of information on genetic disorders of patients of which they are not aware can contribute to an increase in the risk of patient death. This fact also leads to the need to integrate medical and health data with various biological and omics data, especially in pandemic circumstances. Although the urgent need for health care and medical data integration is apparent, personal data protection laws are rigorous. They do not allow much progress in the field without implementing healthcare data security and privacy standards. The proposed solution for this issue is establishing a personal health record as an integrative system for the patient applying HL7 (FHIR) standards. The well-known medical codding systems promise future data integrations. In addition, some attempts are made to associate diseases with data obtained from external environmental sensors that measure disease-related data. Using these data, called exposure data or exposome, one can clarify the increasing symptoms of diseases influenced by external factors. In the paper, we highlight a cloud-based system—a model of PHR-based health care that collects different data sources such as EHR, health information systems, and sensor measurement into the PHR. Medical data, PHR, numerous biological and exposome data, and data obtained from sensors, are considered, stored, and managed on the cloud.',\n",

Although many older adults experience “successful aging” and positive emotional well-being, biological, psychological, and social factors may favor the development of depressive disorders, one of the frequent and disabling diagnoses of mental health in this age group. The prevention of depressive episodes in older adults is, thus, an important line of action to support their well-being and quality of life. This includes actions at various levels to reduce risk factors and enhance protective ones. This chapter offers a broad perspective of the available findings regarding the prevention and early intervention of depression in older adults. The first section analyzes the consequences and main risk factors of this health concern. The second section covers the general characteristics of the prevention of depression in this age group. The third describes the results of efficacy studies of specific psychosocial preventive programs based on different components (physical exercise, mind-body connection, psychological, and multicomponent approaches), while the fourth and final section comments on the background presented and outlines future challenges.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This chapter presents a theoretical model that links working conditions with men’s and women’s retirement preferences via their physical and psychological health and their subjective age and longevity expectations. The model is based on the assumption that ‘subjective age’ is a central variable in retirement decisions that mediates the relationship between working conditions and individuals’ preferred retirement timing. The theoretical model is tested\\xa0using survey\\xa0data from a representative\\xa0sample of older workers in Austria.\\xa0Based on findings from multivariate regression analyses, we conclude that improved working conditions – directly and via improved health and feelings of youthfulness – can help delaying the timing of labour market exit. Improvements in working conditions would help to extend working life, because workers who enjoy ‘good working conditions’ tend to feel healthier and younger and would be willing to work until a higher age. Job attributes that help workers to maintain a sense of youthfulness and encourage them to stay part of the active work force until a higher age include high intrinsic job quality (e.g. learning and development opportunities at work, task variety) and employee-led time flexibility. Older workers in ‘bad jobs’ that involve physical work strain and time pressure tend to feel older and to prefer an earlier retirement.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The prevalence of depression in children and adolescents is increasing worldwide. The early onset of a depressive disorder in childhood and adolescence can negatively influence socio-emotional, cognitive, and academic development as well as school and family functioning. Therefore, interventions to prevent child and adolescent depression are necessary. In this regard, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) implemented in schools can help to fulfill this purpose. This chapter shows that MBIs in schools can effectively reduce risk factors and increase protective factors involved in child and adolescent depression. MBIs aimed at children, adolescents, teachers, and parents are examined considering their mechanisms of action and their effectiveness in preventing child and adolescent depression. The evidence presented in this chapter shows that implementing MBIs in schools for children, adolescents, teachers, and parents individually and separately effectively reduces child and adolescent depression. Also, evidence suggests that implementing MBIs in schools from a community and systemic perspective, involving students, teachers, and parents simultaneously in the intervention, may be more successful in preventing child and adolescent depression. Further research must be conducted on the effectiveness of implementing an MBI in school contexts to reduce child and adolescent depression.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Tourism has been one of the most important economic sectors in the Alps for many years. However, not least because of the cuts due to the pandemic, new and innovative approaches are needed to meet current challenges such as climate change, shortage of skilled workers or demographic change in order to make Alpine tourism fit for the future. The topic of health offers great potential in this context. With the KPI approach, therefore, a possible access to a nature-based health tourism with medical evidence is presented, which should support the actors from the tourism practice in the further development of the Alpine tourism. At the same time, the KPI approach also offers possibilities to enable an overall more sustainable development of the Alpine region. This paper places the KPI approach in a larger development framework and explains the underlying analytical system based on selected indicators.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Children Children are rarely explicitly articulated as environmental rights holders and beneficiaries per se in international and EU environmental law. However, this does not mean—as this chapter will reveal—that, not only the current legal international environmental frameworks arguably tend to be adult-centric and fail to provide international standards (and very few national ones) on the environmental rights of the child per se, a child-centred approach Child-centred approach to the environment Environment cannot (but should) be discerned on account of his/her vulnerability to environmental impacts on their physical and mental health Health . In parallel to the CRC, because of the ‘at risk Risk ’ nature of children Children and infants, between the lines, a child-centred approach Child-centred approach is also perceptible and is justified in international and EU environmental law so that much of the multilateral legislation designed to address environmental issues ought to benefit the child as a distinct recipient. In this chapter it will be shown that ‘Children Children have rights because they have interests that are sufficiently important to impose duties on others’ not only from a theoretical perspective but also looking more closely at the formulation of international and EU environmental law which indirectly recognise children Children as rights holders of procedural environmental rights: From another standpoint, an image of children Children as resources to be used to achieve sustainable Sustainable development development Development and, relatedly, as a proxy Proxy for future generations Generations future is also discernible examining international and EU environmental law though with different extents.',\n",

Appropriate practice with these populations, however, requires competencies grounded in a deep understanding of culture, trauma, and loss.

       "  'abstract': 'Introduction While short-term surgical outreach trips improve access to care in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), there is rising concern about their long-term impact. In response, many organizations seek to incorporate capacity building programs into their outreach efforts to help strengthen local health systems. Although leading organizations, like the World Health Organization (WHO), advocate for this approach, uniform guidelines are absent. Methods We performed a systematic review, using search terms pertaining to capacity building guidelines during short-term surgical outreach trips. We extracted information on authorship, guideline development methodology, and guidelines relating to capacity building. Guidelines were classified according to the Global-QUEST framework, which outlines seven domains of capacity building on surgical outreach trips. Guideline development methodology frequencies and domain classifications frequencies were calculated; subsequently, guidelines were aggregated to develop a core guideline for each domain. Results A total of 35 studies were included. Over 200 individual guidelines were extracted, spanning all seven framework domains. Guidelines were most frequently classified into Coordination and Community Impact domains and least frequently into the Finance domain. Less than half (46%) of studies collaborated with local communities to design the guidelines. Instead, guidelines were predominantly developed through author trip experience. Conclusion As short-term surgical trips increase, further work is needed to standardize guidelines, create actionable steps, and promote collaborations in order to promote accountability during short-term surgical outreach trips.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Eudaimonic well-being builds on the writings of Aristotle and integrates contemporary theories of positive psychological functioning. The empirically operationalization is detailed, emphasizing the importance of rigorous psychometric evaluation. Scientific advances of this model of well-being are noted, showing links to sociodemographic factors, experiences in work and family life, and health outcomes. Three future directions for research are considered. The first addresses growing problems of socioeconomic inequality and their role in undermining the opportunities of disadvantaged segments of society to experience eudaimonia. These problems have now been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately impacted those who were already vulnerable. The second new direction examines the role of the arts and humanities as factors that nurture eudaimonic well-being. Whether the arts can activate needed compassion and caring among the privileged is also considered. The third new direction examines the intersection of entrepreneurial studies with eudaimonic well-being. Conventional conceptions of entrepreneurial success focus on business profits; a case is made that eudaimonia, of the entrepreneur as well as his/her employees and surrounding communities, constitute further measure of success that elevate issues of virtue, morality, and ethics.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Many people who suffer from mental disorders do not have access to adequate treatment options and the use of, and access to, prevention and mental health promotion remains limited. The rapid advances in digital technology make a compelling case to help deliver and implement evidence-based interventions in areas of public mental health provision (i.e., mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment of mental disorders). Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMIs) represent a powerful approach that enables provision of adaptive and personalised intervention components. EMIs build on principles of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and are centred around the dynamics of individuals’ experience and behaviour, and their interaction with contextual factors in daily life. They offer a unique opportunity to deliver personalized interventions that are tailored to what individuals need in a given moment, context, and setting. This chapter explores the conceptual framework within which EMIs are defined, outlines their current applications, and provides an outlook of technology-enabled mental health care.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'With the onset of Covid-19 as the biggest health disaster globally, the world witnessed the new phenomena of lockdowns, social isolations, containment zones, and quarantines. Affecting all dimensions of life be it social, economic, or health, this disaster has exposed the socioeconomic inequalities that will adversely impact the existing vulnerable sections of the population based on caste, class, ethnicity, religion, race, disability, and gender. The existing gender inequalities will be exacerbated affecting women the most that stand at the intersection of such ascribed identities. “None of us will see gender parity in our lifetimes, and nor likely will many of our children. That’s the sobering finding of the Global Gender Gap Report 2020, which reveals that gender parity will not be attained for 99.5 years” (WEF, Global gender gap report 2020, Insight report, 2020). Similar disease breakouts in the past have amplified gender implications, and thus the current pandemic will inexplicably affect women and girls. It is against this backdrop that this paper tries to look into the irrevocable impact of the pandemic on women’s health especially reproductive, sexual, and mental health concerns. Postponement and restrictions on essential maternal services, diversion of health resources, mental distress, and limitations of family planning services are some of the major concerns. It is crucial to underline the inherent nexus of health and gender inequality which is being amplified due to Covid-19 and will worsen it further. Thus, the study concludes by outlining the need for proactive inclusive public health responses at the earliest.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Due to the constant use of smartphones in daily life, mHealth apps might bear great potential for the use in health care support. In this chapter the potentials, limitations, current quality and future directions of mHealth apps will be discussed. First, we describe potential benefits like quicker facilitation of information, patient empowerment and inclusion of undersupplied population groups. Furthermore, the use of mHealth apps for diverse somatic and mental health conditions will be discussed. Beyond, the chapter provides the reader with a short overview on the efficacy of mHealth apps for different indications: Exemplary, we provide evidence for the efficacy of mHealth apps in the realm of asthmatic disease, depression and anxiety disorder. Despite the availability of mHealth solutions, the acceptance of among health care providers is still moderate to low. This represents a substantial problem, as health care providers are important gate keepers for intervention uptake. In this context we describe methods to foster acceptance. Furthermore, we address potential risks of mHealth app use including low responsiveness towards critical situations (e.g. self-harm) or the difficulty for users to assess the quality of the app’s content. Here we refer to standardized instruments to assess app quality. With respect to the massive amount of sensitive data already being collected through such mHealth apps, we also reflect on the latest current legal situation in Europe and the United States.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Celebrities are an important part of the pop cultural landscape and the ways they approach mental health function as models for how to think about such issues in culture at large. This chapter explores how mental illness has been talked about in celebrity discourse during the 2010s. I delineate the shift in celebrity media from outside speculation about what ailments a star might suffer from to a climate where celebrities themselves speak firsthand about their painful experiences. Part of this was a changing media landscape broaching increasingly intimate topics as authenticity has become one of the most valued aspects of celebrity branding. The primary focus is on the celebrity health narratives of Demi Lovato and Selena Gomez, but I also discuss Lana del Rey, Britney Spears, and the spate of “trainwreck”- celebrity coverage of 2007-2008. The analysis of these health narratives shows how a profitable vulnerability and supportive conversations around mental distress exist in tension with each other in the world of celebrity media.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'An historic shift in focus on the quality and person-centeredness of health care has occurred in the last two decades. Accounts of results produced from reinvigorated attention to the measurement, management, and improvement of the outcomes of health care show that much has been learned, and much remains to be done. This article proposes that causes of the failure to replicate in health care the benefits of “lean” methods lie in persistent inattention to measurement fundamentals. These fundamentals must extend beyond mathematical and technical issues to the social, economic, and political processes involved in constituting trustworthy performance measurement systems. Successful “lean” implementations will follow only when duly diligent investments in these fundamentals are undertaken. Absent those investments, average people will not be able to leverage brilliant processes to produce exceptional outcomes, and we will remain stuck with broken processes in which even brilliant people can produce only flawed results. The methodological shift in policy and practice prescribed by the authors of the chapters in this book moves away from prioritizing the objectivity of data in centrally planned and executed statistical modeling, and toward scientific models that prioritize the objectivity of substantive and invariant unit quantities. The chapters in this book describe scientific modeling’s bottom-up, emergent and evolving standards for mass customized comparability. Though the technical aspects of the scientific modeling perspective are well established in health care outcomes measurement, operationalization of the social, economic, and political aspects required for creating new degrees of trust in health care institutions remains at a nascent stage of development. Potentials for extending everyday thinking in new directions offer hope for achieving previously unattained levels of efficacy in health care improvement efforts.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background E-Health care is already well established in some (non-) surgical specialties and is considered as a means of improving patient-centred care. Considering the demand of remote health care changes, especially in the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to investigate the feasibility of e-Health care within one of the most performed surgery procedures: inguinal hernia repair. Methods A total of 60 patients used the e-Health application in this study compliant. Primary objectives were to investigate the accuracy of the “deviating post-operative course” alerting by the e-Health application. Secondary objectives included patient perspective and e-Health costs analysis. Results Forty-four patients reported no deviation in the post-operative course using the e-Health application of which 93.2% ( n \\u2009=\\u200941) was in concordance with the findings during standard follow-up. Within 16 patients reporting a deviating post-operative course, a true complication was found in 25% ( n \\u2009=\\u20094). Based on in-hospital costs, a hypothetical e-Health follow-up scenario was more expensive (€59.5 per patient) than current standard follow-up care (€28.2 per patient). Usage of the e-Health application showed a high perceived overall patient satisfaction: 4.2 (on a Likert-scale of 1–5). Conclusion An e-Health application is a promising tool for identifying patients who require in-person or phone follow-up assessment. Patients’ perspectives surveys revealed high potential and willingness of using this application. A hypothetical e-Health follow-up scenario showed to be more expensive compared to current standard follow-up. If the identified (dis)advantages can be improved, e-Health follow-up care appears to be promising in terms of safety and feasibility. Future studies can leverage on this study and further investigate the use of e-Health within the field of general surgery.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This chapter provides an overview of the working environment as determinant of retirement (section “Working Conditions as Determinants of Retirement”) and its role as mediator of the health effects of retirement (section “The Health Effect of Retirement”). In the first\\xa0Section on “Working Conditions as Determinants of Retirement”, we summarize studies showing that having a good job is an important aspect of individuals’ retirement decisions. Mostly positive working conditions appear to contribute to individuals’ later retirement, but adverse working conditions not necessarily relate to earlier retirement. Moreover, adverse conditions can be buffered when combined with high job control, job resources or social support. In\\xa0the Section\\xa0on “The Health Effect of Retirement”, we focus on how retirement affects health\\xa0in both theoretical and applied studies, suggesting that\\xa0the inconclusiveness illustrated in theories is also evident in empirical work. Previous studies, however, vary largely regarding the adopted (1) health outcomes, (2) study designs, (3) definition of retirement and (4) the type of work performed before retirement. These four factors could explain the inconsistencies of the results. We finally focus on the latter factor, showing that the effect of retirement on health tends to be positive for workers retiring from low quality or more demanding jobs. Our chapter concludes with policy advices regarding how to promote longer and healthy working lives and a discussion of relevant groups to pay attention to.',\n",

Daher ist es bedeutsam, die psychische Gesundheit in Bestrebungen der Gesundheitsförderung und Prävention in den Blick zu nehmen und unterstützende Maßnahmen zu diskutieren. Da die Schule ein wichtiger Lebens- und Wirkort im Leben junger Menschen ist, kann hier ein wesentlicher Anknüpfungspunkt für Unterstützung verortet werden. In diesem Zusammenhang haben Lehrkräfte als Schlüsselpersonen für Schüler:innen eine besondere Position inne. Um sie bei der Adressierung und Förderung der psychischen Gesundheit ihrer Schüler:innen zu unterstützen, kann auf die mit dem Mental Health Literacy (MHL) Konzept assoziierten Kenntnisse, Fähigkeiten und Einstellungen gesetzt werden. Demzufolge werden in diesem Beitrag die Grundzüge des MHL-Verständnisses, die Relevanz und mögliche Potenziale von MHL bei und für Lehrkräfte dargestellt, sowie auf Erkenntnisse und Lücken der Forschung zu MHL bei Lehrkräften verweisen.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the second half of the Imaginary Republic , Agostini begins the formal description of the utopian society. The new topic changes the dynamics between the characters of the dialogue: Finite takes over Infinite’s role and becomes the one leading the conversation. The first part of the depiction of the utopia focuses on its health system. Renaissance utopists typically investigate this topic in detail, yet Agostini’s account stands out amongst those of his contemporaries for its length and broad scope—health is, in fact, the aspect of his utopia to which he devotes most of his attention. Agostini articulates his exposition into four main parts that examine: (1) the natural conditions conducive to health (the site and climate of the city), (2) the urban sanitary measures designed to avoid the rising and spreading of diseases (adequate housing, streets cleanliness, population distribution), (3) the lifestyles promoting health (diet and sleep), and (4) the best ways of restoring health (doctors and physicians). However, in his analysis of the utopia’s health system, Agostini keeps reminding, via Infinite, that though human beings should attend to their physical well-being, their greatest priority should be their spiritual health.',\n",

Vision Zero for suicide has a multilevel and multidisciplinary approach that intends to provide a systemic change in society to facilitate and put suicide prevention on the agenda. This chapter explores the origins of Vision Zero for suicide by first presenting theoretical models that influenced suicidal behavior preventive programs. Then, Vision Zero for suicide goals, advantages, challenges, and examples of implementation in some countries will be presented. Further, evidence-based suicide prevention programs in existing public health and healthcare settings will be described as they support the Vision Zero aims.

       "  'abstract': 'Dementia presents unique challenges for the measurement of health-related quality of life (HRQL). The subjective nature of the HRQL construct, the\\xa0cognitive demands of questionnaires,\\xa0and the necessity of sometimes relying on a proxy report\\xa0taken together mean that traditional questionnaires scored using classical psychometrics may not provide robust measurement. Advanced psychometric methods, such as those based on Rasch measurement theory, can provide possible solutions to these challenges. Rasch based methods have been used with the DEMQOL/DEMQOL-Proxy disease specific HRQL instrument to measure HRQL in people with dementia, to\\xa0provide robust scales, to\\xa0equate self- and proxy-reported instruments, and to create\\xa0a cross walk from a proxy-reported measurement to the equivalent self-reported measurement. These methods also provide a qualitative understanding of statistical change. Advanced psychometric methods such as those based on Rasch NI Rasch, G. measurement theory therefore provide a potentially powerful way to address the challenges of measuring HRQL for people with dementia. However, the use of these methods is not a quick fix.

       "  'abstract': 'Absenteeism of government frontline health workers can prevent access to primary care, including outpatient care, pre- and postnatal care, deliveries, and vaccinations. As rates of absenteeism tend to be higher in lower-income areas, this issue has the potential to exacerbate the socioeconomic divide. Specifically in Punjab, Pakistan, government doctors posted to rural health clinics, called Basic Health Units (BHUs), were found to be absent two-thirds of the time. Health inspectors are employed to visit BHUs at least once a month to collect data from a paper-based register located at each BHU and ensure doctors are present. However, absenteeism of the government inspectors causes this system to break down. This case study follows the implementation of the “Monitoring the Monitors” program, which aimed to replace the paper-based record-keeping system with an app-based system that feeds an online dashboard system (for real-time aggregation and presentation of data). Conducting a large-scale randomized controlled trial, inspection rates increased from 25.5% to 51.9% after 6\\xa0months. After a year of operation, inspection rates were 33.8% in the treatment districts and 23.5% in control districts. An A/B test was used to measure the effect of a simple flagging system that notified senior health officials when health workers were absent during an inspection and showed an increase in doctor attendance from 23.6% to 41.3%. The government eventually adopted this system (rebranded as HealthWatch), and it is now one of the many apps being used to monitor frontline service providers.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Internet of things (IoT), the modern paradigm of networking is constantly evolving and has become a common area of research with numerous opportunities. IoT-enabled devices have helped solve many problems in the health-care sector, and the improved potential to keep patients safe and healthy has empowered physicians to provide superlative care. These devices range from sensors that monitor the gluten and glucose levels in the blood and patient’s blood pressure and heart rate to even monitoring food and water intake. This chapter intends to provide a detailed overview of how IoT has spread its branches far and wide into the field of health care. The real-time applications of IoT like the diagnosis of diseases, surgery, clinical trials, etc. have been explained in detail. Moreover, various important aspects like biosafety, security, and legal challenges with respect to its commercialization have also been discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This chapter looks at conversations around depression and anxiety in the online archives of Cosmopolitan (US) and Teen Vogue . I examine the different orientations of these magazines when it comes to mental health by discussing their respective styles, tone, narratives, mode of address, and types of pedagogy and support around these issues. While Cosmopolitan tended to follow a script for postfeminist media—full of contradictions, covering serious topics in a tongue-in-cheek way that undermined any gravity, Teen Vogue offered a nuanced portrayal of mental illness that incited its readers to a more critical and engaged interpretation of dominant mental health paradigms. In this sense Cosmo provides an example of profitable vulnerability in that it aligns itself with the trendy themes of depression, anxiety, and other diagnoses, while maintaining a comfortable distance that avoids striking a too somber or heavy tone. Teen Vogue , on the other hand, does offer more spacious definitions of mental illness that does not shy away from difficult conversations. With their focus on support and their providing of resources, they are more aligned with the critical sad girl culture found on social media.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Due to many protracted crisis situations around the world, displaced people often take refuge in neighboring countries for long periods of time. The humanitarian community and host-country governments continue to work toward durable solutions to address the needs of a growing number of refugees. One of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee’s three durable solutions to address the long-term needs of refugees is host-community integration . While considering this durable solution requires developing areas of support within host countries, such as the labor markets, health care, and education sectors, it is necessary to also account for the host-country population needs. Benefits and challenges of integration, best practices to create social cohesion, utilization of sustainable approaches to development for the host and hosted populations, and social workers’ role in host countries will be reviewed in this chapter, using Turkey as a case study.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'For many clinical leaders, the struggle to solve budget problems is frustrating and takes too much of their attention. To get control of finances, it is essential that clinical leaders understand the basics of hospital financing, and are up to date on key metrics, which include clinical activity data, numbers of employees and material costs. These insights should be used to take action whenever financial result is not according to budget plans. This chapter discusses and presents practical advice on how to take control over finances. The chapter also discusses hospital financing in a society perspective and reviews OECD data, which show that current trends in hospital expenses are not sustainable. The chapter gives insights into what are the major inefficiencies in hospital services and suggests how society should meet the challenges. Traditional as well as novel methods for hospital financing, such as value-based payment and bundled payment, are discussed. The chapter also discusses what should be expected from good clinical leaders when it comes to handling financial challenges and what their superior should expect. The chapter explains the importance of attitude for becoming a good leader, and how wrong attitude and disloyalty can make leaders unsuitable for their job.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Initially established to meet the wartime needs of service members and their families, the Canadian Military Social Work occupation continues to deliver occupational and clinical social work services in a unique environment. Through almost 80\\xa0years of organizational and societal change, this occupation, composed of approximately 200 civilian and uniformed social workers, has strived to match the needs of the individual with those of the service. Whether through outreach and collaboration, preventive programmes, screenings and assessments, advocacy, or provision of clinical services, social workers in the Canadian Armed Forces work closely with other care providers and helping professionals to assist military personnel and their families to manage the unique demands of service. As eloquently observed by Major Ken Jacobs on the 21st anniversary of the occupation, “military social workers have always had an impact upon the total service and service-connected population far in excess of their meagre numbers. Dollar for dollar, in symbolic comparative terms, Military Social Work is certainly one of the most profitable investments the service has made” (Jacobs. Foreword to social work newsletter twenty-first anniversary, Ottawa, 1974).',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'As Latinxs become exposed to US culture, their risk for many chronic diseases increases, including the risk of cancer. On average, less acculturated Latinxs consume more nutrient-dense foods including fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; they are also more active than their US counterparts because they use active transportation. Cultural and behavioral patterns of recent immigrants may prove to be protective; these patterns are based on the Latinx values of collectivism, familismo , and personalismo . As generational status in the United States increases, positive health behaviors related to dietary intake and activity diminish. Interventions that reinforce these practices may mitigate the negative effects of the acculturation process by capitalizing on behaviors that are protective against the risk of cancer. Traditional Latinx cultural values can be integrated into public health practice and intervention, preserving traditional Latinx practices that are protective and promote positive health outcomes. The integration of cultural beliefs and values into research studies will increase relevancy for Latinx participants and contribute to compliance and long-term participation for improved population health.',\n",

In der Literatur werden sowohl der soziale Hintergrund als auch die Lebenskompetenzen und die Gesundheitskompetenz als Einflussfaktoren auf das Gesundheitsverhalten und dadurch auch auf den Gesundheitszustand anerkannt. In der Längsschnittstudie „Lions Quest Erwachsen werden“, aus welcher unsere empirischen Befunde stammen, wurden neben den soziodemographischen Eigenschaften auch die Gesundheitskompetenz und fünf Lebenskompetenzen der Schüler*innen untersucht. Unsere Ergebnisse deuten auf die eigenständige Wirkung der Selbstwertschätzung, der Emotionsregulierung, der Gesundheitskompetenz sowie des Geschlechtes auf den Gesundheitszustand der Schüler*innen hin. Diese Befunde bekräftigen die Relevanz der Kompetenzverstärkung für eine erfolgreiche schulische Gesundheitsförderung.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Traffic safety measures such as seat belts, helmets, and speed limits have often been opposed by people claiming that these measures infringe on their liberty. Safety measures are often described as paternalistic, i.e., as protecting people against their own will. This chapter provides a historical account of such criticism of safety measures, beginning with nineteenth-century opposition to sanitation measures, which were claimed to threaten the freedom to drink dirty water. The historical analysis has a surprising conclusion: Opposition to safety measures does not seem to have much to do with paternalism. Some measures that would typically be described as paternalistic, such as seat belts in commercial aviation and hard hats on construction sites, have met with no significant opposition. In contrast, some of the most vehemently opposed measures, such as speed limits and the prohibition of drunk driving, cannot with any vestige of credibility be described as paternalistic. This is followed by an analysis showing that due to our tendency to follow examples set by others (herd effects), purely self-affecting behavior is much less common than what has usually been assumed. Most of the opposition to safety measures in road traffic seem to result from some individuals’ desires to engage in activities that endanger other people’s lives. The social need to restrain the satisfaction of such desires is obvious.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Hispanic/Latina breast cancer survivors (BCS) in the United States experience disparities in survivorship outcomes, including worse health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and symptom burden than non-Hispanic/Latina BCS. Despite documented efficacy among BCS in general, few psychosocial interventions are specifically designed for Hispanic/Latina BCS. With increasing technology use among US Hispanics/Latinos, e-health interventions such as smartphone applications can deliver more easily accessible, scalable, and culturally tailored psychosocial interventions. Two culturally informed smartphone applications for Hispanic/Latina BCS— My Guide (intervention) and My Health (control)—were developed and evaluated. Results demonstrated the feasibility of study procedures and the high acceptability of both applications, which showed improvements in breast cancer well-being and symptom burden over time. A third application— My Guide for Breast Cancer Treatment —was developed to expand the focus of My Guide to Hispanic/Latina women currently in active treatment for breast cancer; a second pilot randomized controlled trial will compare this new application to usual enhanced care. Given the lack of culturally tailored, evidence-based, e-health psychosocial interventions for Hispanic/Latina BCS, My Guide and My Guide for Breast Cancer Treatment may bridge a gap in cancer care, providing needed psychosocial resources to this underrepresented population. E-health supportive and behavioral interventions focused on breast cancer, and its treatment may improve patient engagement as well as patient-reported outcomes among Hispanic/Latina women during active treatment for breast cancer and into survivorship.',\n",

The evidence-based science shows the beneficial effects of functional foods on human health and reduction in development of chronic disorders. The functional foods are present in large amounts in the animal foods such as dairy products (probiotics and prebiotics), fish (omega-3 and DHA) and meat products (peptides), and B group of vitamins and minerals. The functional foods in form of bioactive compounds can be induced in the diet in form of palaeolithic diet, Atkins diet or ketogenic diet (not in extreme phases) for short duration of time. Various researches demonstrate the benefit of the bioactive compounds present in functional foods in improving human health; for example, probiotics and fibres are important for maintaining gut health, antioxidants and polyphenols remove free radicals and reduce oxidative stress, and flavonoids have anti-carcinogenic properties and many more. The functional foods have numerous benefits for the disease prevention and maintaining human health which is evidence based and will be elaborated in the chapter.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Health systems need a comprehensive and drastic revision of their approaches to promote better care for the aging populations to tackle and solve the stigmas applied to older persons. Healthy aging defines the process of developing and maintaining the functional ability that allows well-being in older age. It is based on three cardinal factors for the person: functional ability (i.e., “health-related attributes that enable people to be and to do what they have reason to value”), intrinsic capacity (i.e., the composite of all the physical and mental capacities of an individual), and environment. The maintenance of functional ability represents the common goal of the public health framework. At the same time, the intrinsic capacity model entails an essential shift from a negative to a positive perception of health, quitting obsolete traditional paradigms (i.e., diseases, impairments, disabilities) to the assessment of the individual’s positive attributes (i.e., functions, reserves). In this chapter, a novel approach that the World Health Organization has recently described for promoting healthy aging in our societies is presented. The framework promotes a substantial modification of the health and social care systems that should be redesigned having the individual at the center of a multidisciplinary and multidimensional action.',\n",

Using an innovative methodological approach which combines insights from Latour ( Science in Action. How to Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Society , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1987) and media studies with a dramaturgical perspective (Goffman, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life , London, Penguin, 1959/1990), it is argued that both institutions perform expertise in a conservative fashion, which allows them to articulate knowledge on bipolar disorder as stable and precise.

Continuous innovation takes place to improve the industry competitiveness, but especially the tourists’ experience and wellness with new product offerings. This Chapter collects and describes the innovation practices proposed and developed in some pilot regions of the HEALPS2 project consortium. The innovation practices identified in the project can be subdivided into three types, i.e., innovation techniques, innovation supporting tools, and innovative product offerings. All the practices were designed to target several operators of the Nature-based Health Tourism (NHT) industry, from tourism facilities and companies (especially small- and medium-sized enterprises) to regional councils and municipalities in charge of policy-making and tourism strategy development. HEALPS 2 innovation practices and techniques can be purposefully integrated at the regional and local level for a more innovation-driven industry strategy and business development, as well as facilitation of transnational cooperation among key actors, also beyond Alpine regions and NHT destinations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this chapter, we explore processes and practices of everyday prison interior (re)design through analysis of the creation of a specialist unit for prisoners with severe mental illnesses in a large reception prison in the North of England. We argue that meeting the needs of prisoners with serious mental illnesses forms an increasingly important part of decision-making regarding contemporary prison (re)design. Firstly, we attend to adaptation to understand the complexities of re-designing existing interior spaces within the custodial estate to meet the needs of specific groups. Secondly, we explore the opportunities presented by indeterminacy, as the Unit began operating when so many elements of its design, usage and regime were still unknown. Finally, we elucidate the centrality of forms of accommodation in the re-design of the Unit, involving compromise and negotiation. We conclude that attuning analysis of prison design to the everyday processes and practices that shape much of the custodial estate enables insights to improve the re-design and adaptations of existing prisons.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Since its origins, medicine has been more linked to the cure of diseases than to their prevention. This is due to multiple factors, training of health professionals aimed at curing diseases, lack of quality data, processing capacity, poor multidisciplinary approach, etc. However, this paradigm is changing, focusing on maintaining the health of individuals to avoid diseases, improving social welfare. To achieve this, the new approach proposes that medicine must be Preventive, Participatory, Predictive, and Personalized (P4 Medicine). In this chapter, we will analyze how artificial intelligence can convincingly contribute to the construction of P4 Medicine, through the processing of key data such as DNA, electronic medical records and environmental variables to which people have been exposed. Here we can find complex data such as Computed Tomography images, electroencephalograms, free text in electronic medical records, pharmacological data, etc. These data have grown exponentially and efforts to improve their quality are already paying off. However, it is no longer possible for a health professional to analyze them to provide a better diagnosis or carry out preventive work on diseases, requiring the formation of multidisciplinary teams to find new solutions to ancient problems, such as healthcare, where data processing, knowledge extraction and its subsequent parameterization in support systems for medical decision-making are vital to save lives. In this sense, artificial intelligence, together with new methods for processing complex data and computational resources to process massive data, will be key to improving the humanity health.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Arsenic (As) is an extremely toxic metalloid of global concern. Numerous health and environmental organizations have classified As being the “toxic and dangerous for the environment”. Environmental and food chain contamination by As has been described globally, especially in Asia. Numerous reports have reported high As contents in the groundwater of South-Asian countries, especially India and Bangladesh. According to several reports, globally about\\u2009>\\u2009200 million individuals are at severe risk of As-poisoning due to possible exposure to its toxic levels in drinking water, irrigation water, soil and edible plant tissues. Some recent reports in Pakistan have also revealed As levels\\u2009>\\u200910\\xa0mg/L in groundwater of the country. The groundwater is routinely consumed for drinking in many regions of Pakistan, especially Punjab and Sindh provinces. Hence there is a possibility of severe As-poisoning in different areas of Pakistan containing high As in groundwater. Moreover, soil/crop irrigation by As-containing groundwater has mediated As build-up in soils in different areas of the country and thereby a potential accumulation in food crops. Exposure to As, even at low levels, via any potential source can induce numerous As-mediated health issues, such as cancer. Hence, there is a need to assess the As environmental contamination level in the country. The purpose of this book chapter was to compile recent data regarding As status in groundwater, soils and food crops in Pakistan. The data compiled in this book chapter can be highly useful for future studies and policy making by regulatory authorities.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Although anxiety disorders are the most common mental health problem among young people, more than 80% of children and adolescents do not receive treatment. Implementing interventions in schools may overcome barriers to care and serve as a cost-effective means of addressing the unmet mental health needs of anxious youth. The school environment is also a natural setting for anxiety interventions, as many common triggers of anxiety occur in school, such as approaching peers and taking exams. This chapter presents four school-based intervention programs for child and adolescent anxiety: FRIENDS, Cool Kids, Skills for Academic and Social Success, and the School-Based Treatment for Anxiety Research Study. These four programs were selected because their feasibility and transportability have been demonstrated in multiple randomized controlled trials, and there have been significant efforts to investigate whether they can be delivered effectively by school personnel. Following the overview of these programs, various issues, challenges, and future directions related to the implementation of school-based anxiety interventions are discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Traffic safety measures such as seat belts, helmets, and speed limits have often been opposed by people claiming that these measures infringe on their liberty. Safety measures are often described as paternalistic, i.e., as protecting people against their own will. This chapter provides a historical account of such criticism of safety measures, beginning with nineteenth-century opposition to sanitation measures, which were claimed to threaten the freedom to drink dirty water. The historical analysis has a surprising conclusion: Opposition to safety measures does not seem to have much to do with paternalism. Some measures that would typically be described as paternalistic, such as seat belts in commercial aviation and hard hats on construction sites, have met with no significant opposition. In contrast, some of the most vehemently opposed measures, such as speed limits and the prohibition of drunk driving, cannot with any vestige of credibility be described as paternalistic. This is followed by an analysis showing that due to our tendency to follow examples set by others (herd effects), purely self-affecting behavior is much less common than what has usually been assumed. Most of the opposition to safety measures in road traffic seem to result from some individuals’ desires to engage in activities that endanger other people’s lives. The social need to restrain the satisfaction of such desires is obvious.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Children are the least responsible for environmental degradation and climate change Climate change , yet they will bear the greatest burden of its impact Impacts , and even if children have not been entirely neglected in environmental treaties, a comprehensive regime that extends environmental human rights to them is still absent. However, the Convention of the Rights of the Child (CRC), which is the most ratified human rights instrument, is dedicated to children’s rights and is unique in specifically referring to the dangers and risks of environmental pollution. This chapter will propose a critical analysis of the normative basis underlying the articulation of environment-related rights Environment-related rights for children. After clarifying the notion of child and the point at which childhood can be said to begin, it will first consider conventional provisions containing explicit references to the environment and then discuss other provisions that indirectly protect environmental aspects of children’s rights. It will also address the Convention’s general guiding principles Guiding principles , which show that the drafters were aware of the long-term impact Impacts of environmental pollution and its intergenerational Intergenerational implications, for safeguarding the present generation Generation present is a pledge towards the protection of future generations Generation future . Finally, attention will be turned to ways in which the content and scope of the Convention’s express and implied rights and principles are being and can be expanded, notably through the proactive stance taken by the Convention’s monitoring body, the Committee on the Rights of the Child. A positive trend is evidently manifested in the General Comments General comments and Concluding Observations Concluding Observations (COs) that has progressed the environmental due diligence obligations and are moving from indirect considerations to explicit mainstreaming Mainstreaming of climate change Climate change issues and related obligations. Moreover, following the entry into force of the Optional Protocol on a Communications Procedure (OPCP), which recognises that children have the right to appeal to an international mechanism specific to them, when national mechanisms fail to address violations effectively; the outcome of the most recent individual communication in 2021 has opened new perspective on jurisdictional issues as to multiple countries simultaneously accountable for obligations under the CRC related to climate change Climate change . There is reason to think that this proactive stance will be further explained and developed in the next, much-awaited General Comment General comments on children’s rights and the environment with a special focus on climate change, which is due in 2023.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Albert Einstein is quoted to have said: “The definition of genius is taking the complex and making it simple.” The goal of this chapter is to make one a bit of a genius when it comes to understanding the complex mechanism for paying for health care. The journey begins with an examination of the foundation of coverage and benefits. Coverage : through eligibility of Medicare for those >65\\xa0years of age, disabled, as well as those with end-stage renal disease and amyotropic lateral sclerosis. Benefits : Medicare alphabet soup provides Parts A–D where A includes hospital, skilled nursing facilities short term, and hospice; B includes provider services; C are the benefits of A\\xa0+\\xa0B provided through a managed care organization under Medicare Advantage (MA); and D provides prescription drugs. Whereas Medicaid covers skilled nursing facilities long term as well as the out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses of Medicare. These OOPs can also be covered through Medigap coverage. Care delivery is especially confusing given the changes occurring in shifting from volume to value-based payment models as well as the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Of the three factors – coverage, benefits, and delivery – coverage eligible is the most stable element, while benefits are adjusted annually and delivery is rapidly undergoing change currently. Delivery : while primarily through fee-for-service (FFS) providers, it is shifting to value-based care through growth of MA enrollment but especially with managed care principles being applied within the FFS by at-risk groups such as Accountable Care Organizations and similar delivery models.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The activation of stress-related neuroendocrine systems helps to maintain homeostasis, but excessive stress can damage body functions. We review current evidence from basic sciences and epidemiology linking stress to the development and progression of metabolic disorders throughout life. Findings from rodents demonstrate that stress can affect features of metabolic dysfunction, such as insulin resistance, glucose and lipid homeostasis, as well as ageing processes such as cellular senescence and telomere length shortening. In human studies, stressors in the home, workplace and neighbourhood are associated with accelerated ageing and metabolic and immune alterations, both directly and indirectly via behavioural risks. The likelihood of developing clinical conditions, such as diabetes mellitus and hepatic steatosis is increased in individuals with adverse childhood experiences or long-term (years) or severe stress at work or in private life. The increased risk of metabolic disorders is often associated with other stress-related conditions, such as mental health disorders, cardiovascular disease and increased susceptibility to infections. Equally, stress can worsen prognosis in metabolic diseases. As favourable modifications in stressors are associated with reductions in incidence of metabolic disorders, further investigation of the therapeutic value of targeting stress in personalized medicine is warranted. Life stress is known to affect the development and progression of metabolic diseases. This Review discusses the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the association between stress and metabolic disease, and evaluates the epidemiological evidence for the influence of stress on metabolic disease. Both animal and human research suggests that stress and related changes in sympathetic–parasympathetic balance and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis can accelerate biological ageing, including unfavourable changes in metabolism and immune function. The adverse impact on metabolic disease risk in adults with a history of childhood adversity is potentiated by mental disorders and behavioural risks and the risk of metabolic disease can be more than twofold higher than in adults without childhood adversity. In adults, stress is associated with a 1.1-fold to 1.4-fold excess risk of obesity, diabetes mellitus and liver disease. The excess risk for mental disorders, such as depression, and cardiovascular disease among individuals with stress in adulthood is slightly higher than that for obesity, diabetes mellitus and liver disease. Life stress is also a prognostic factor in patients, accelerating the transition of metabolic diseases towards multimorbidity, frailty and death.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Demographic aging is a worldwide phenomenon. Dementia is one of the most disabling conditions affecting older people, and its prevalence and associated costs are expected to rise significantly within the next few decades. Most people living with dementia, especially those from low socioeconomic backgrounds, are cared for and supported by their family members, who are mostly women. The negative physical and psychosocial impact of caring for a person with dementia, including depressive disorders, has been widely documented. Comprehensive management of dementia usually encompasses psychoeducation, training, and counseling in coordination with mental health-care interventions. Several types of non-pharmacological interventions have been developed, with evidence supporting especially cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based programs.',\n",

According to future projections, only Africa will experience a steady increase every 10 years. Yet, their nutrition and food security are not given sufficient attention and priority like other vulnerable groups. Many of them encounter health challenges caused by degrading of body organs’ functionality. Diverse chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, cancer, Alzheimer, osteoporosis, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases) are managed mainly by medications, such diseases can be prevented and managed, with appropriate diets with broad or specific functionality. This review aims to identify various foods and their role in geriatric health. In addition, It reflects on the role good nutrition in the elderly population plays in obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, bone health, oral health, and mental health.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Unsafe and unhealthy working conditions contribute to more than 2.3 million deaths globally each year. Vision Zero (VZ) in workplaces presents the challenge to prevent all serious accidents and work-related sickness and disease. Companies and other organizations play a key role, in the development and implementation of VZ, and are supported by international organizations such as the International Labour Organization and the International Social Security Association (ISSA). VZ in workplaces has a long history and several roots, which explain the variety in its application. It is both conceptually and practically closely associated with the development of a broad prevention culture, focusing on the safety, health, and well-being of the workforce as an integrated part of business. VZ in workplaces has developed quickly since the Seoul Declaration (2008), whereby global occupational safety and health leaders and representatives of national governments expressed their will to create a worldwide culture of prevention. In particular, the ISSA launched a global VZ strategy and campaign in 2017, which now (in 2021) runs in more than 80 countries. VZ policies and strategies for both road traffic and workplaces are overlapping and can strengthen each other, as roads are an important place of work in many jobs. The implementation of VZ in workplaces should be regarded as a commitment strategy, based on genuine commitment of both top leaders and all personnel. It is important that VZ in workplaces is understood as a vision and a long-term ambition, not as a target. Proactive leading indicators are therefore more important for VZ than lagging indicators, such as accident frequencies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Social inclusion has a complex nature that is associated with a wide range of positive educational and developmental outcomes, including psychosocial health, well-being, prosocial behavior, and academic functioning. There is burgeoning research suggesting that social inclusion is an important resource to promote mental health and well-being, however, creating these relationships within highly complex educational systems can be challenging. This chapter aims both to reflect ongoing literature and to contribute to a new research agenda that focuses on the value of examining important aspects of social inclusion to foster youth mental health and well-being in school contexts. This chapter emphasizes the importance of inclusive experiences for the improvement of psychological health and flourishing, points out strategies for enhancing inclusive experiences, and fosters the adaptive strategies enabling youths to find ways to improve their sense of belonging and connectedness in schools. Given the empirical evidence that points out both short- and long-term outcomes associated with social inclusion, implications for widespread benefits are possible for schools that prioritize positive experiences improving social inclusion and belonging for youths. School-based prevention and intervention services that improve the inclusive experiences at school may contribute to better mental health and well-being.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this pandemic situation, there are many problems facing people from all over the world. For example, economic downgrades, family problems, illness, and health problems, etc. Indonesia is one of many countries facing this situation. With a record of being the fourth most populous country in the world, Indonesia easily creates a lot of problems in this pandemic situation. This pandemic situation has made the world aware of such problems in their lives. One of the important types of problems that arise from this awareness is the maintenance of physical health. Maintenance of physical health is very important for this pandemic situation. COVID-19 can really cause many diseases, and therefore, health maintenance is very important to get rid of this virus. Many media inform the public to take care of their physical health, but there are also many things that need to be considered and continue life as it is. Therefore, information explaining the importance of maintaining physical health is needed by people in Indonesia, and this study tries to review the importance of health maintenance. This data can be shown in of an app, where it is all currently done digitally, in conjunction also with COVID-19 pandemic that has resulted all people to become digitally literate. In addition, there is also the risk of access to meet other people if you have to consult a doctor, so making a physical health maintenance application during the COVID-19 pandemic will be very helpful. Various educations can be given to the public, such as educating the public that taking supplements/vitamins is important in preventing the COVID-19 virus. Consuming minerals and vitamins for endurance is indeed important during the current pandemic, because the body needs these substances to increase endurance. Apart from supplements, vitamin and mineral needs can also be obtained from various types of food. According to dietitian Maxine Smith, eating healthy foods is the best way to keep the immune system in balance, because the immune system relies heavily on nutritious food. This is because healthy foods contain various substances, including vitamins and minerals as immune support.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The link between nature and human wellbeing is well established. However, few studies go beyond considering the visual and auditory underpinnings of this relationship, even though engaging with nature is a multisensory experience. While research linking smell to wellbeing exists, it focuses predominantly on smells as a source of nuisance/offence. Smells clearly have a prominent influence, but a significant knowledge gap remains in the nexus of nature, smell, and wellbeing. Here, we examine how smells experienced in woodlands contribute to wellbeing across four seasons. We show that smells are associated with multiple wellbeing domains, both positively and negatively. They are linked to memories, and specific ecological characteristics and processes over space/time. By making the link between the spatiotemporal variability in biodiversity and wellbeing explicit, we unearth a new line of enquiry. Overall, the multisensory experience must be considered by researchers, practitioners, policy-makers and planners looking to improve wellbeing through nature.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the past 20\\xa0years, over 11,000 published articles have examined the relationship between religion and spirituality (R/S) and mental health. This chapter summarizes that literature, drawing on recent meta-analyses and narrative reviews while focusing on mood, anxiety, and trauma-related disorders. Complex associations exist between R/S and mental health, with the preponderance of the research suggesting generally modest, positive effects. The impacts of religious/spiritual involvement, meaning making, religious coping, and spiritual struggles are considered. Following this review, the psychological processes in R/S are examined from the perspective of positive psychology. The interrelated contributions of positive emotion, virtues, and meaning making are identified as essential aspects of R/S that promote well-being and are associated with mental health. Commonalities between religion and spirituality are found in their capacities to evoke positive emotions, support meaning making, and foster the cultivation of virtues. The intersections between secular (positive psychology) and sacred (religious/spiritual) pathways to mental health are highlighted, an integrative conceptual model is proposed, and recommendations for future research are offered.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background Neighborhood-level factors have been shown to influence surgical outcomes through material deprivation, psychosocial mechanisms, health behaviors, and access to resources. To date, no study has examined the relationship between area-level deprivation (ADI) and post-mastectomy outcomes. Methods A cross-sectional survey of adult female breast cancer patients who underwent lumpectomy or mastectomy between January 2018 to June 2019 was carried out. Patient-specific characteristics and ADI information were abstracted and correlated with postoperative global- (SF-12) and condition-specific (BREAST-Q) quality-of-life performance via multivariable regression. Patients were classified into three ADI terciles: 0–39 (low deprivation), 40–59 (moderate deprivation), and 60–100 (high deprivation). Results A total of 564 consecutive patients were identified, being mostly white (75%) with mean age of 60.2 ± 12.4 years, median body mass index of 27.8 [interquartile range (IQR) 24.3–32.2) kg/m 2 , median Charlson Comorbidity Index of 3 (IQR 2–5), and mean ADI of 42.3 ± 25.7. African American and Hispanic patients and those with high BMI were more likely to reside in highly deprived neighborhoods ( p = 0.003 and p < 0.001). In adjusted models, patients in highly deprived neighborhoods had significantly lower mean SF-12 physical (44.9 [95% CI, 43.8–46.0] versus 44.9 [95% CI, 43.7–46.1] versus 46.3 [95% CI, 45.3–47.3], p = 0.03) and BREAST-Q psychosocial well-being scores (63.5 [95% CI, 59.32–67.8] versus 69.3 [95% CI, 65.1–73.6] versus 69.7 [95% CI, 66.4-73.1], p = 0.01) relative to moderate- and low-deprivation groups. Conclusions Patients residing in the most deprived neighborhoods were identified to have worse psychological well-being and quality-of-life. The ADI should be incorporated into the shared decision-making process and perioperative counseling to engender value-based and personalized care, especially for vulnerable populations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Healthy living is an essential aspect of sustainable socioeconomic growth and development. Those who are healthy, can effectively cope with everyday challenges and avail better living standard. This research article aims to highlight the importance of health and the role of media as an important social institution to promote a healthy lifestyle and awareness. The authors highlighted the potential of mass media content to spread health awareness and reinforce healthy behaviours among the audience. For this purpose, Social Marketing is one of the most preferred techniques that can influence public beliefs and attitudes towards personal healthcare. For instance, Social Marketing ads regarding Cancer, HIV and Breast Cancer are an illustrating example of mass media influence to spread awareness and promoting healthy lifestyles. Besides, during the outbreak of EBOLA, Zika, MERS, SARS, Social Marketing also helped to inform the public and as a result, they adopted personal care measures. Thus, the researchers concluded that the role of mass media to promote healthcare is of greater significance. However, besides media, other artificial intelligence should also play their role to provide better health opportunities and improve the living standard by new media.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Social isolation and loneliness have been linked to negative physical and mental health outcomes, including increased depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as an increased risk of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, cognitive decline, and other noncommunicable diseases. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, everyone was advised to follow physical distancing as a preventive measure. Lockdowns have been imposed, and all of this was very new to everyone. This brought drastic changes in older people’s daily routines, lifestyles, the care and support they receive, their ability to stay socially connected, and how they are perceived. They have received stricter directives on physical distancing as they were one of the first groups encouraged to stay home and are more prone to getting COVID-19 infections. Older people are being challenged by requirements to spend more time at home, lack of physical contact with other family members, friends and colleagues, temporary cessation of employment and other activities, and anxiety and fear of illness and death. The burden of pre-existing noncommunicable diseases or comorbidities, as well as the prevalence of communicable diseases, was exacerbating their situation. The aim of the present study is to determine the impact of social isolation, loneliness, and existing comorbidities on the mental and physical health of the elderly during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic globally.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The use of antibiotics in human medicine is being monitored in most developed countries, antimicrobial use in livestock and food production Food productions , however, is currently poorly monitored and assessed. It has become increasingly recognized that the widespread application of antimicrobials in food production Food productions is contributing to the emergence and proliferation of antimicrobial-resistant species. The presence of clinically relevant multidrug-resistant species in food-producing animals may result in human cases of infectious disease. The push towards intensive livestock production systems to meet food demand has increased antimicrobial use in livestock both metaphylactically and prophylactically as growth-promoting agents. Better monitoring, surveillance, and understanding of the consequences of the uninhibited use of antibiotic agents in veterinary are needed to fully determine its potential impact on animal and human health. To protect human, animal, and environmental health and ensure sustainability Sustainability , there is a dire need to develop alternative options for use in food production Food productions . The impacts of antimicrobial use, the proliferation of resistance Resistances , zoonotic disease, and environmental effects are discussed. Adequate disinfection protocols, vaccination programs, and alternative options such as antimicrobial peptides and bacteriophages, which may help alleviate the overuse of antibiotics in food-producing animals, are also discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This contribution aims to describe how the convergence of digital design and medical design can lead to the realization of innovative design solutions, which improve the relationship between science and society and in particular between medicine and society, especially concerning the design of artifacts that can empower healthcare and wellbeing for society. The analysis of the scientific literature and the state of the art of reference, highlights the increasing use of digital, new technologies and innovative tools, in the field of medical and health design, in particular for the realization of goods and services capable of increasing the diffusion of health and well-being in society. Nevertheless, it is not possible to avoid reflections on contemporary issues, such as environmental sustainability and equal access to care and treatment, which make improving the quality of life accessible and widespread. These themes will be addressed through the description of a design and production approach, developed within the framework of an Industrial Characterization Ph.D. in Environment, Design, and Innovation, which, thanks to the use of the new technologies and tools of digital design, parametric design, and additive manufacturing, has dealt with the design of therapeutic and rehabilitation devices, customized to specific needs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Combining a unique dataset of birth records with municipal-level real estate information, we assess the impact of the 2008 recession on the health of immigrants’ newborns in Italy. Health at birth (e.g., low birth weight) of children born to immigrants deteriorated more than health at birth of children born to Italian natives. The negative effects on immigrants are not equally distributed across ethnicities, but rather are driven by the main economic activity of the ethnic group and its related network at the municipal level. Immigrants whose ethnic group is mainly employed in the sectors most affected during the recession suffered the most. Living in a municipality where their ethnic network is organized through more registered immigrant associations mitigates the recession hardship for immigrants. The characteristics of ethnic groups and their organization at the municipal level do not explain the heterogeneous effects on Italian newborns, which confirms the presence of network effects rather than neighborhood effects',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) is a framework used to promote high performance teams, prioritizing principles of justice and intersectionality. There is abundant evidence that members of marginalized communities, such as racial and ethnic minorities and sexual and gender minorities, experience higher threats to well-being than members of dominant groups. Such threats include systemic racism and discrimination, bias, sexism, and homophobia, all of which are deeply ingrained in medical culture. Recognizing and responding to these threats requires an understanding of how individual identities influence interactions in the workplace, including evaluations and promotions, team dynamics, and career trajectory. Discrimination and bias are known contributors to adverse outcomes in emotional and physical health, career satisfaction, and social connectedness in the workplace. Any effort to promote well-being and decrease burnout must center DEI as a foundational component of that effort, or risk further marginalization of certain groups and likely failure of the intervention.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Stress is a complex phenomenon, perceived when demands exceed resources. Chronic stress may profoundly impair health and quality of life. Understanding and applying the physiologic mechanisms responsible for both stress and relaxation can allow pediatricians to enhance their health and well-being. Workload is an important potential source of stress. The experience of work demands is mediated by work resources, as conceptualized by the Demands-Resources model. Workload can be assessed by measuring its impact on the worker, using tools such as the NASA Task Load Index. Specific skills and experiences in work, such as compassion and meaning, are powerful mediators of the impact of work on physicians and are critically tied to patient care. In this chapter we also explore specific solutions to address stress and workload, and discuss system design to enhance physician and care team well-being.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'One way in which religion and spirituality are relevant to the science and practice of positive psychology is through their links to life satisfaction. This chapter reviews scientific research on the relationship between religion/spirituality and life satisfaction. After providing conceptual definitions, we offer an overview of findings from systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and large-scale studies, which collectively indicate there is a small, positive relationship between religion/spirituality and life satisfaction. We highlight longitudinal evidence indicating that religion/spirituality predict future life satisfaction, but we acknowledge that the size and nature of this relationship can differ between individuals, communities, and countries. We discuss these and other nuances. Next, we explore reasons for the links between religion/spirituality and life satisfaction, including the possibility that religion/spirituality can promote social connection, meaning, hope, coping, and physical health, all of which promote life satisfaction. At the same time, we take a nonreductionistic approach that acknowledges the unique contributions of religion/spirituality to life satisfaction—contributions that cannot fully be explained on the basis of indirect influences. We review the predominant limitations in this body of research and offer suggestions for advancing the study of religion/spirituality and life satisfaction. Finally, we conclude with applied implications for clinicians and religious/spiritual leaders.',\n",

Starting from the literature analysis and an online survey, the system implemented a comprehensive knowledge base adopted for an ontology-based Decision Support System leveraging on identified Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Relying on this knowledge, the digital tool provides a list of tailored and customized recommendations for each destination within the Alpine area. This result helps the stakeholders capitalize on the nature-based health tourism potentials of their region in relation to the existence of the natural resources and different target users’ health conditions.

       "  'abstract': 'Of the 1.3 million women in the United States under criminal supervision in 2017, approximately 117,000 were housed in jails (The Sentencing Project, Incarcerated women and girls , 2019). The physical environment in which jail residents live drastically impacts their daily routines, accessibility to services, and feelings of safety and security. Considering most jails in the United States are binarily sex-segregated and house significantly more men than women, the gendered nature of these facilities is particularly apparent in the purposive design of these facilities. For women, the design of a facility may act as a barrier to getting their needs met because facilities are not constructed to specifically meet their needs which differ in number and types from the needs of men. Using a case study of one jail, this chapter will dissect how the carceral space, layout, and design of the facility makes it challenging to ensure the needs of women are met through connections to educational programming and health services. In this way, architectural decisions are direct reflections of the purposes and goals of a correctional facility (Wener, The environmental psychology of prisons and jails: Creating humane spaces in secure settings , 2012), which in this chapter is argued to be both non-rehabilitative in nature and gendered at its core.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The humanitarian crisis recently striking our world has led millions to flee their homes and country to find refuge in other places. Health non-governmental organisations (NGOs) such as Adventist Help (AH) arose from the need to provide aid and lessening human suffering. Working in this context over the past 5\\xa0years demonstrated a compromised quality of care, due to an uncertain and limited health record system (HRS). If quality in healthcare have been associated with a functional HRS for its management, delivery, and safety, thus the identification and implementation of such a system is imperative. The systematic collection of patient’s health features and continuity of care to a database is elemental to ensure high standards of care, especially in contexts where health systems are destroyed or disrupted leaving the population affected without proper care. Using a service design methodology, this study aims to develop a HRS’ service blueprint within an emergency field hospital in Iraq, inside a refugee camp, to avert a scenario of a meagre patient care. A service safari with informal ethnographic interviews was conducted to understand the current situation leading to a Service Prototype and Speed consulting workshop with national and international health professionals working at AH’s field hospital, to explore improvement opportunities to the present system. Organisational and individual accountability, and a HRS’s upgrade where the predominant solutions for improvement and re-design of the current system, increasing the access and quality of patient’s care and communication between health stakeholders.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This chapter interrogates the proposition that extending working life is an unproblematic policy measure introduced to address demographic ageing and increased pension costs. The implications of extending working life varies for workers in different occupations. The chapter draws on interview data from a qualitative study of 17 men and 20 women workers in the United States. Interviewees working either as teachers or in physically-demanding jobs such as care-giving for older people or cleaning narrated their work-life history and discussed their current work, future plans and their views on working longer. Analysis of different strands of their work-life trajectories – work, family, health – from a life course perspective reveals that workers may be channelled into particular kinds of employment and that advantage or disadvantage can accumulate across the life course. It supports previous research showing that physically-demanding work adversely affects workers’ health. Gendered expectations regarding the provision of care can result in disrupted careers for women, leading to lower pension provision and the need to continue working later. Such processes, combined with pension reforms and the increasingly precarious nature of employment can lead to poor economic and health outcomes for some workers. The implications of these findings for policy are discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This chapter presents intelligent fault diagnosis methods based on deep transfer learning, which largely enhance the fault diagnosis performance in the real-world applications. The deep learning architectures are expected to represent features automatically instead of feature extraction by human labor, and the transfer learning gives an approach to further increase the model generalization ability in different scenarios. First, a few-shot fault diagnosis method using deep belief network and continual learning is introduced to solve the issues that limited monitoring data are available to train the intelligent fault diagnosis model. Second, a method transferring knowledge from the laboratory to the real cases is presented for an extreme condition, i.e., none training data is available. Third, a deep partial transfer learning strategy is provided to promote the success of knowledge transfer when the required diagnosis knowledge is less than that provided. Fourth, when unknown fault condition exists in the testing scenario, instance-level weighted adversarial learning achieves the success of diagnosis knowledge transfer. The methods are demonstrated on diagnosis cases of industrial robots, locomotive bearings, gearboxes, etc. They come up with possible solutions to applications of intelligent fault diagnosis to engineering scenarios with respect to industrial big data.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Health is an important research field for the Economics and Sociology of Conventions (EC/SC), but the implications of health in the domain of work and employment are notably absent in the debate. Yet, health in terms of a well-functioning body and mind is a crucial precondition for employment. In the workplace, health is inextricably tied to work capacity: What matters is the degree to which health enables or hampers a person to meet given productivity standards. Work in capacity due to health impairments therefore raises deeply normative questions not only for the economy but also for the welfare state. To what extent is incapacity to be tolerated in the productivity-driven world of work, and what is the just and adequate support for people with disabilities who cannot make a living through gainful work? Convention theory offers a number of useful theoretical concepts to analyze these questions, which organize the presentation of EC/SC research on health and employment in this chapter. Handling work incapacity depends on classification: What counts as standard work capacity, or, conversely, as incapacity which legitimizes special treatment? Managing health troubles triggers disputes and requires justifications in the economy and in the welfare system. The (non-)employment of people with health impairments depends on the valorization of labor, which in turn relates to a plurality of quality conventions and respective tests. Finally, dealing with work incapacity is structured by investments in forms that allow classification, valorization, and the coordination of labor market inclusion and support.',\n",

The search was performed in 4 electronic databases, applying the PRISMA Statement approach. Were retrieved records between 2015 and 2021 using 11 keywords combined by a Boolean operator. Articles with applied research on costs produced by work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) in different countries and activities were considered. Questionnaires proved to be reliable methods to evaluate the expenses. The risk of bias was assessed concerning the evaluated sample and limited surveys. The selection of the articles allowed to realise that the highest cost is due to lost production, compared to sickness absence and medical assistance. WMSD is detrimental to both workers’ health and the business economy. Strategies to decrease muscle disorders could minimise the risk of illnesses, consequently decreasing costs originated by WMSD. The review article raises awareness of the costs produced due to WMSD around the world.',\n",

Centre for Transnational Development and Collaboration, London, 2017) have resulted in the forced migration of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) people, particularly from the Global South to the Global North. This chapter provides a brief historical overview of the relationship between colonial regimes and the criminalization of nonnormative sexualities and genders, particularly within the Global South, as well as the emergence of the legal recognition of LGBTQI+ migrants in Canada and the United States, with a particular focus on sexual orientation, gender identity and expression (SOGIE)-based refugee claims. There will be an exploration of post-migration policy challenges and structural barriers faced by sexual and gender minority (SGM) migrants, with a focus on asylum-seekers. This chapter also explores both micro- and macrofactors that shape pre- and post-forced migration experiences of SGM migrants, including initial reflections on the impacts of COVID-19. In addition to highlighting key frameworks addressed in the literature regarding practice with LGBTQI+ migrants, an in-depth case study of an LGBTQI+ migrant health clinic will be presented to highlight the ways in which social workers and directly impacted people can contribute to an innovative model of integrated service delivery. Thus, this chapter aims to present approaches, models, knowledge, skills, and strategies to engage in integrative social work practice with LGBTQI+ migrants, including advancing policy change and advocacy strategies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Objective This study aims to assess the impact of psychosocial risk factors on nurses’ stress. Background The overall impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers, nursing workers especially, led to an emotionally exhausting daily work activity, making them prone to occupational hazards, namely psychosocial ones. Method A cross-sectional study was developed with 284 nurses from public and private hospitals in Portugal. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used to assess mental health, and psychosocial risks were assessed through the Health and Work Survey (INSAT). Results Results showed a strong exposure to psychosocial risks. Work pace and intensity, work relationships and emotional demands stood out with higher global average percentages. However, it is worth noting that nurses still showed great joy and pleasure in performing their work activities. Conclusion A support network in the work environment needs to be promoted to prevent nurses’ emotional stress and promote their psychological well-being during the present global health crisis. Application Therefore, research in this area is essential to understand the psychosocial risks that affect nursing workers and assess the less visible work-health relationships.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Sensors represent the prerequisites for data collection in the field of digital phenotyping and mobile sensing. Today, many sensors are connected over the Internet or feature advanced processing, thus provide smart functions that go beyond simple measurements. Embedded in everyday devices such as smartphones and wearables, smart sensors enable the collection of a vast amount of data in a natural setting and the unobtrusive real-time monitoring of people’s lives. Initial empirical studies illustrate the possibilities and high potential of using ubiquitous smart sensors in health research. However, to realize the full potential, a deeper understanding of the underlying concept of smart sensors in health research is important. The present chapter aims to give a theoretical, non-technical introduction to the basic concepts of smart sensors in mobile health sensing. Hence, this chapter provides a brief overview of currently available sensors and proposes an overarching taxonomy. For the sake of simplicity, the focus of this chapter will be on smart mobile sensors, in particular those currently embedded in smartphones. Following this, we will briefly discuss what can be sensed and how health can be predicted from this sensor data. Additionally, we provide examples of research projects based on smartphone sensors, followed by an outlook on current challenges, future research perspectives, and potential clinical applications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Hinduism encompasses considerable heterogeneity within its many schools of thoughts and practice. However, the common thread that binds these multiple perspectives is this handbook’s main topic of inquiry—human well-being and happiness. Hindu thought has always deliberated on the process, nature, conditions, and practices that lead to a fulfilled life. In this chapter, we begin by explaining Hinduism’s core beliefs and tenets that guide daily living. Many extant psychological publications on Hinduism explicate psychological ideas embedded in tradition. We draw comparisons between the Hindu worldview and broadly Western-based positive psychology concepts like well-being and the self. The chapter also expands on select Hindu models of human flourishing. The chapter further explains the recent empirical evidence on Hindu constructs, including well-being enhancing strategies, in relation to several positive psychology constructs such as well-being and flourishing. Finally, in the light of the reviewed empirical evidence, we discuss some directions and recommendations for future research at the intersections of Hindu religious literature and positive psychology.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The unstructured nature of the labor-intensive construction industry negatively affects the health of workers. These challenges require a robust health monitoring approach to accurately monitor workers’ overall health status. Recent advancements in wearable technologies and physiological sensing have provided ample opportunities towards an objective and continuous in-field measurement of workers’ physical and mental status. However, these solutions have mostly focused on a particular health condition. There is a lack of holistic health monitoring to understand the impacts of the construction environment on workers’ health conditions (i.e., physical fatigue, mental stress, and exposure to heat stress). In this regard, the present study investigates the feasibility of a multimodal wearable sensing system to comprehensively monitor construction workers’ overall health status during their ongoing work. To this end, five able-bodied workers were prompted to perform specific construction activities (e.g., roofing, loading/unloading) with light and medium physical intensity while exposed to varying levels of heat stress (i.e., caution level, and danger level). During each task, three biosignals, namely photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and skin temperature (ST), and were collected from the workers through wearable biosensors. To assess their overall health status, various metrics were extracted from PPG (heart rate, heart rate variability), EDA (electrodermal level), and ST (mean skin temperature). Results of correlation analysis elucidated strong correlation between the extracted physiological metrics with respect to workers’ physical fatigue, mental stress, and heat stress exposure. The findings demonstrated the feasibility of a multimodal sensing system for the holistic health monitoring of construction workers.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this chapter, we examine the association between forgiveness and flourishing. We begin by identifying what forgiveness and flourishing are. We then move to considering conceptual models as well as evidence supporting the connection between forgiveness and flourishing. An early model of the forgiveness and mental health relationship offers a beginning in this regard. Next, we examine the stress-and-coping models of forgiveness of oneself and others. The final model is the scaffolding self and social systems model of forgiveness and subjective well-being. These models offer multiple vantage points from which to consider the forgiveness-flourishing connection. Limitations to these models and to the current state of knowledge on forgiveness and flourishing are highlighted, especially the limits to comprehensive assessment of flourishing in the extant literature.

       "  'abstract': 'Although pesticides protect crops against pests and stimulate crop productivity, due to their persistence and their toxic effects on the environment and human health, a significant number of pesticides have been banned from being used and even produced. Most organic banned pesticides belong to the insecticides based on chlorinated hydrocarbons, organophosphorus, carbamate, triazine, organotin, and pyrazole(phenyl-) insecticide classes. Notwithstanding the harmful effects of numerous pesticides, their application in agriculture is still practiced in many regions of the world. In this framework, this chapter is a literature review focused on highlighting (i) the role in agriculture and the actually annual production of 15 banned pesticides with high persistence (lindane, dieldrin, aldrin, endosulfan, parathion and parathion-metil, tributyltin oxide, DDT, pentachlorophenol, chlordane, heptachlor, paraquat, carbofuran, fenbutatin oxide, fipronil, and atrazine), (ii) its spreading in soil, water, air, and products, (iii) its toxicity on animals and humans and its fate in the environment compartments, and (iv) the ability of microorganisms to remove these compounds from the environment. Following the analysis of databases on the production, marketing and use have been found that pesticides such as lindane, dieldrin, aldrin, endosulfan, pentachlorophenol, chlordane, and heptachlor are still produced and marketed, even if the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants impose measures to eliminate their production and use. Furthermore, these pesticides are detected in fruits, vegetables, cereals, dairy products, meat products, chicken eggs, and aquatic organisms, thus increasing the risks to human health. For further remediation of the contaminated environments, the potential of microorganisms to biodegrade these substances was analyzed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Through this study, we seek to know the attitudes, representations and opinions of the Environmental Health Professionals surveyed, about a set of topics related to gender inequality. Centuries of deep-rooted discrimination and patriarchy have resulted in a huge gender power disparity in our society. Historically, the female gender has been constantly discriminated against, for being considered inferior to the male gender. This is a descriptive observational study, with a cross-sectional timeline and knowledge level II. The target population comprises two groups: men and women with degrees in Environmental Health and working in the field. The sampling design adopted was of the non-probabilistic type which employed convenience sampling. To collect the information, a questionnaire was built, using a Likert scale with 5 levels of agreement. Although men had more unequal and penalizing conceptions compared to women, these differences were not statistically significant. Therefore, there was a prevalence of gender stereotypes. This study allowed us to identify, analyze and assess Gender inequalities for Environmental Health Professionals. Most of the results found follow the literature closely and may be relevant to define strategies and programs for future investigations. Our study highlighted evidence of “why” gender equality is so important in terms of Health.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The chapter provides an overview of existing theories of health and well-being that are relevant for a positive psychology of religion and spirituality. Emphasis is given to theories that have an empirical basis or whose main constructs are operationalized through validated measurement instruments. This chapter covers several theories focused on spiritual well-being, holistic health, perceived wellness, eudaimonia (psychological well-being, self-determination theory, and eudaimonic identity theory), virtues and character strengths, and the PERMA model of well-being. To help facilitate programmatic research and greater synergy between the psychology of religion and spirituality, positive psychology, and mainstream psychological science, the chapter briefly describes Koenig’s (Religion, spirituality, and health.

       "  'abstract': \"The research was intended to, identify the possible hazards, preventive and control measures implemented and assess their effectiveness at work place. Kaligandaki Transmission corridor project was selected for the study. The Kaligandaki transmission corridor projects extend from Mygdi to Nawolparasi with construction of three substations at Dana, Kushma and Nawolparasi. The research was carried out by utilizing the data collected from the experience and knowledge of KII experts, local people and researchers field observations along with by asking the duly semi structured questionnaire with client, consultant, contractor's managers, officers, engineers and the workers. It was identified that mechanical and fall hazards were the most prevailing hazards during construction. Exposures hazards, biological hazards, chemical hazards and psychological hazards were also found at work place. The major cause of accidents was the lack of knowledge and skill along with carelessness of the workers. Other activities like scaffolding works, deep excavation, material transportation, lifting and assembling of towers parts were also found as the equally risky activities during the construction of transmission line. It was responded that the major health problem faced by the workers due to physical hazards was the back pain and wrist pain. Similarly due to chemical hazards most of the workers responded allergic as the main health problem they faced during construction. So the management commitment towards motivation, health and safety along with workers participation are essential for the success of the project. Prevention and control measures have to be plan as per the level of risk.\",\n",

Three years later, that emergency continues to affect Central American children and families who arrive with physical and mental health problems after experiencing an arduous migration process. First, this chapter will cover a brief history of US involvement in Central America that contributed to the economic destabilization of the area. This history will provide context for push and pull factors that have led Central American families to leave their home countries. Next, empirical studies will be reviewed to demonstrate how pre-migration trauma, the migration process, post-migration experiences, and family separation, all together impact the mental health of Central American migrant families. The resilience of Latinx immigrant families and youth is highlighted as an important resource. Overall, the chapter dismantles the idea that the USA is susceptible to an invasion of criminals, gang members, and human traffickers by highlighting publicly available data from the federal government and current literature to demonstrate that there is a humanitarian crisis and a pressing need for policy reform and immigrant services, not a call for increased safety measures.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Between man-made crises, such as conflict and war; natural crises, including droughts, cyclones, and tsunamis; and public health emergencies, such as Ebola, cholera, and COVID-19, it was projected that 235 million people worldwide would be impacted by crises spanning more than 50 countries in 2020. The pandemic of COVID-19 led to a 40% increase on 2020 projections of people in need, including the already forcibly displaced worldwide (over 74 million people) who remain particularly vulnerable. The humanitarian system has created different types of coordination structures to help respond to emergencies, with the type of structures dependent on whether people are internally displaced or are refugees and whether it is the national government, United Nations agencies, or UNHCR leading emergency coordination efforts. Coherent information systems across and within sectors guide response planning, coordination, and program implementation. This chapter will review the various coordination structures for emergency response, the challenges and best practices of information management, and where the role of social workers fit within the humanitarian architecture. Case studies from Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Uganda, and Vanuatu will help social workers to understand, reflect, and analyze coordination models.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The prevalence of substance use disorders is relatively high among physicians (Oreskovich et al., Am J Addict 24(1):30–8, 2015). Various factors are believed to contribute to this phenomenon, including the intense demands and stress of the job, access to highly potent medications, personality factors, and tendency to self-medicate and/or avoid seeking help. Substance use disorders among physicians can lead to practice impairment, putting patient safety at risk, and can also contribute to significant physical and mental health consequences for the physician (Merlo et al., UpToDate, Wolters Kluwer, 2019). They are associated with both physician burnout and suicidal ideation (Oreskovich et al., Arch Surg 147(2):168–74, 2012). Thus, substance use, and substance use disorders, can be viewed as both consequences of and contributors to physician distress, making the topic a key challenge to physician well-being. However, it is important to recognize that recovery is both possible and likely for physicians who take advantage of existing resources, such as state physician health programs (also known as impaired practitioner monitoring programs) (McLellan et al., BMJ 337:a2038, 2008; DuPont et al., J Subst Abuse Treat 36(2):159–71, 2009).',\n",

The chapter shows that progressively, Vision Zero moved from being cited in documents as an example of a transformative policy to being promoted as a way of thinking about or approaching road safety for countries to adopt. In addition, it has been used as a principle in the Road safety strategy for the United Nations System and its personnel . This strategy embraces the ethical imperative that “no road users, including pedestrians, should be killed or seriously injured in road crashes involving United Nations vehicles.” It commits United Nations organizations to Vision Zero.

Whilst not formally recognised as a specialist\\xa0field of practice in Australia, Military Social Work (MilSW) plays an important role in supporting\\xa0current and ex-serving military personnel and their families. Civilian military social workers are employed in both\\xa0the Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, and services are provided\\xa0at micro, mezzo, and macro levels. It\\xa0is also noted that a smaller percentage of social workers in private practice also provide services to the veteran community. The diverse range of MilSW\\xa0settings and interventions\\xa0are outlined\\xa0in this chapter, and it is\\xa0highlighted that MilSW predominates in family-sensitive settings, as well as clinical settings, such as in health and mental health. The authors conclude that MilSW is an emerging specialist field of practice that\\xa0presents the Australian social work profession, university Social Work Departments and academia with opportunities to advance the profession.\\xa0It is suggested that enhancement of social work education\\xa0to include\\xa0MilSW concepts, academic research, policy development, promotion of the unique aspects of MilSW practice, and international collaboration will lead to conditions conducive to establishing the MilSW professional identity in Australia.

Though the usage of big data analytic methods, instruments, and digital platforms is applied in a variety of fields, they have promising research guidelines for medical organisations to implement and deliver new cases of use for potential health applications. As evidenced by pioneering research initiatives, the success of medical applications in big data is dependent solely on the architecture and on the deployment of related tools. New research has been undertaken to derive specific healthcare frameworks, providing diverse analytical data capabilities for handling data sources, from electronic records to medicinal images. We have presented several analytical avenues from a variety of stakeholders in the patient-centred healthcare system. About underlying data sources and the analysis capabilities and application areas, we also reviewed different big data frameworks.

       "  'abstract': 'Latinos have higher incidence rates of cervical, gall bladder, liver, and gastric cancer, and higher mortality rates for six cancer sites than US Whites. This review chapter focuses on Latino cancer disparities, how the exposome can be applied to understanding Latino cancer disparities, and how environmental exposures lead to alterations in key biological pathways at the cellular, molecular, and system level, helping to explain the increased risk for population level cancer disparities among Latinos. An exposome-wide association study (ExWAS) approach is proposed as a novel conceptual framework to assess the role of multiple chemical and non-chemical exposures in the cause and progression of cancer among Latinos across the life course. Also discussed is how this strategy could be exploited by using biomarkers of susceptibility, exposure, and effect; and how a trans-omics approach, using recent advances in genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and lipidomics, could be used to deploy new biomarkers that serve both prognostic and diagnostic purposes. Also outlined are the knowledge gaps and scope for future studies in this area with implications for public health and policy interventions.',\n",

In this study, we find that prenatal exposure to a cholera epidemic in Peru increased childhood mortality and that surviving children were more likely to be underweight and to suffer from diarrhea. We further find that a significant part of this mortality happened during the first day of life, and that prenatal exposure to cholera decreased prenatal care and institutional deliveries, suggesting that the mortality and possibly other longer-term effects were partially driven by a reduction in prenatal investments.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This study seeks to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and commitment of managers within construction firms towards the recent construction H&S legislation changes. This study further aims to identify the differences in responses between management personnel and construction workers within construction firms. An empirical research approach was adopted using a quantitative method of data collection and data were analysed using IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25. Furthermore, descriptive statistics was used to analyse data and data were interpreted using inferential statistics. Cronbach’s Alpha reliability test was conducted to determine the internal consistency of the constructs. Furthermore, independent t-test was conducted to determine the statistical significance of the means between the groups of respondents. The findings from management and construction workers within construction firm revealed that although there was a small correlation between management commitment and knowledge of H&S legislation, there was no statistical significance between the two constructs. Also, management was not fully committed in applying all the aspects of the construction regulations to improve construction workers wellbeing. The findings revealed that there is a need for more knowledge of H&S legislation and management commitment. The paper proposes measures for managers to engender full compliance and to apply all aspects of the construction regulations such as to; improve knowledge; improve working conditions, consider the health and wellbeing of workers and treat health and safety as a value and not just a priority.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In Part II of this book, I theorised that the influence of science on multilateral negotiation could be understood through 4 criteria: representation and access, the organisation of epistemic communities, framing and temporal dynamics. The empirical analysis presented above reveals several theoretical and practical insights that augment these criteria, which are here explored in order to better explain the influence of scientific evidence in multilateral policy development, for example, under representation and access the space afforded by new institutional arrangements was a recurrent theme of the interviews. Meanwhile each epistemic community demonstrated highly diverse influencing and engagement approaches, suggesting that the modalities of engagement for non-state actors are wholly contingent on the structure and coherence of their community.',\n",

The Armed Services began to develop their own social work positions in 1945 with the commissioning of active duty uniformed social workers, adding civilian military social workers in 1951. This chapter focuses on social work services delivered to military families and communities by civilian military social workers. There are four practice areas addressed in this chapter. The first is the work performed in community service centers/family support centers. The growth in their mission from a focus on transitional/relocation services to expansion of prevention services in family violence is covered. The second area is the role of social workers in the delivery of family advocacy/family violence services. Key to this section is the development of assessment and diagnostic tools around intimate partner violence. The third area of practice focuses on medical social work. Changes brought by managed care are outlined and new areas associated with the needs of wounded warriors addressed. The fourth area is practice with substance use disorders. Recent changes in the delivery of services are discussed. Key to these changes is the emphasis on a more comprehensive treatment approach that addresses not only the substance abuse but also any underlying mental health issues and any marital/family issues. Program evaluation and research are discussed throughout, and current staffing levels are provided.',\n",

Both belonging and inclusion are linked to positive academic outcomes and general well-being of students. Belonging is described as a subjective and dynamic feeling while the definition of inclusion varies among different discourses. The aim of this chapter is to discuss the role of belonging to inclusion particularly among marginalised populations and groups. It highlights the usefulness of assessing an individual’s belonging as a true measure for inclusion and its importance as a social and ethical obligation. This chapter further explains that belonging is a vital component to inclusion, equity, and diversity.

       "  'abstract': 'Ready-made garments (RMG) and textile sectors, the main foreign currency earning sectors employing over 3.8 million poor workers in Bangladesh, have recently drawn international attention due to concerns related to the occupational health and safety (OHS) of workers. In Bangladesh, yearly 11,700 workers experience fatal injuries and approximately 24,500 die from work related diseases across all sectors. This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of the current occupational health and safety standard/regulations of garments and textile industry workers in Chittagong, Bangladesh. Twenty garments and textile industries were purposely selected having granted permission from their owners to consult workers. The sample size of the research was 200 undertaking 10 respondents randomly selected for interviews from each garment industry. In addition to the experimental group, a sample of 100 participants comprised of teachers and workers from the education sector were interviewed from a control group for this study. Secondary data was used to examine the OHS policies, practices, and action plans in industries. A variety of statistical techniques (weightage analysis, frequency distribution etc.) were applied to analyze the data. The most pronounced health problem as determined from data collection include: the most pronounced health problems included by severity: knees (86%), shoulders (79%), neck (73%), ankles (60%), low back (56%), wrists (54%), right elbow (52%), and hips (33%). The causes of diseases indicated by respondents include heavy workload with prolonging work in a congested and hot humid environment, and not having meals at the appropriate time. Knowledge about workplace policies, OHS awareness and participation in OHS drills has been assessed by the Likert scale method. Apart from experiencing physical health problem, the workers suffer from mental stress, job and social insecurity. Finally, the research offers recommendations to improve OHS in the RMG and textile industry workers including having a worker-friendly environment, improved OHS care facilities, post-accident rehabilitation, and compensation for work injury.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The proportion of the aged population is growing at a faster rate than any other population age group globally (Velkoff et al. 2006). This population’s workforce Workforce happens to be one of the largest in many parts of Africa, especially when compared to others worldwide (United Nations 2016). In most African countries, the aged population group takes a significant proportion of the total population, making them crucial to the African economy. However, less attention is being paid to this growing population in terms of their current challenges, especially in the aspect of health care. Information derived from the World Health Organization shows that 28–35% of the elderly fall every year globally; leading to injuries Injuries , injury Injuries -related disabilities Disabilities , and death in the aged population (CDC 2014). This paper focuses on shedding light on the health challenges encountered by the older population in several parts of Africa and discusses how these challenges can be combated to enhance their general wellbeing. The approach used in this paper is a literature review from a variety of prestigious journals providing information about various health challenges encountered by the elderly in several countries in Africa. Some of these challenges include falls, mobility loss, vision, and cognitive impairment Impairment . From the information gathered from several literature reviews, it was discovered that the aged population would live better with the aid of technologies that are user-friendly to their specific geolocation. The use of modern technology like assistive Assistive technology and ergonomically Ergonomically designed accessories can all come in handy in serving as a source of assistance to the elderly population not just in African countries but also in several parts of the world. Given the limitations of technology in various parts of Africa, it can be concluded that more research on improving the aged population's quality of life quality using design and technology has to be further explored. This will in turn help to enhance their health and retain them in the workforce Workforce , thus, increasing the economy of Africa as a whole.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background: mHealth applications have added new dimensions for managing individual and community health and healthcare aspects. To date, information about the prevalence and factors associated with mHealth applications’ use among the Saudi population is scarce. Objectives: This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and to explore determinants of mHealth Apps use among Saudi adults. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out to approach patients and caregivers using healthcare facilities in Hail region, Saudi Arabia. Results: Overall, 470 participants completed the survey questionnaire. Females were 336 (71.6%) and 288 (61.3%) were university educated. Almost all 464 (98.7%) participants were smartphone owners and 423 (90.0%) of them have Internet access, however, 268 (57.0%) only were mHealth applications users. The multivariate logistic regression model revealed that higher education ( P \\u2009=\\u20090.023), easy to access and upload the applications ( P \\u2009=\\u20090.030), having no difficulty in registration ( P \\u2009=\\u20090.005), little effort needed for mastering the applications (0.005) were the independent factors favoring mobile health applications use. Contrariwise, feeling discomfort in using the applications ( P \\u2009=\\u20090.003) and having concerns regarding violation of privacy ( P \\u2009=\\u20090.036), were factors independently associated with not using these applications.

       "  'abstract': 'This chapter will shed light on recent human rights practices at the international and national level, as well as on that of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), in order to pinpoint how children Children have been considered, and could further be considered, as receptive of environmental protection in so far as beneficiaries of rights revendicated by others, such as NGOs NGOs or members of their families, as well as potential environmental human rights holders who promote and vindicate themselves of the negative impact environmental degradation and climate change has on their, and future generations Future generations ’, rights. Children Children in fact should be considered as part of tomorrow’s generations. In recognizing this, the protection of the environmental rights of the members of the future generations Future generations who are already among us (i.e. children Children ) would become a means of caring for future generations Future generations . Children Children appear as ‘the embodiment of future generations Future generations ’, making the division between present and future generations Future generations less sharp than it sometimes appears to be and shifting the line between future generations Future generations and today’s children Children every time another baby arrives on the planet and inherits their full entitlement of human rights. This has the immediate concrete result of re-orienting and reframing the climate debate to one that emphasizes impacts on people, motivating strong action to address the problem. This further opens the possibility to ensure that environmental and climate governance is genuinely based on the inclusion of these individuals’ interests while reflecting individuals’ priorities and preferences (rather than broader developmental ones) with potentially disruptive novelties as to jurisdiction arise to the geographic extent and substantive scope of State responsibility State responsibility for environmental harm, shifting human rights law into the realm of transnational justice, as understood to encompass both political and social justice Social justice on the domestic level and global justice on the international plane.',\n",

According to the developments in computer and communication technologies, health information systems have quickly been used in health institutions. On the other hand, with the spread of health information systems, problems were encountered in ensuring inter-institutional standards and quality. At this point, the selection of health information systems that are compatible with national and international health systems and that will meet the current and future needs of health institutions have gained importance. Purpose of this study is to determine the effective criteria in the selection of health information systems and the importance levels of these criteria. The criteria determined by scanning the literature were reduced to eight (security, cost, system quality and technical support, design, statistical information delivery, decision support system inclusion, accessibility, integration with external systems and subsystem inclusivity) by using the Delphi method with expert opinions. The spherical fuzzy DEMATEL method was applied to determine the importance levels of the criteria. The study will provide important novelties in terms of using the Delphi method at the point of determining the criteria and considering fuzziness and the interaction between the criteria.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The eradication of smallpox – the first and so far only human disease to be eradicated – generated a tremendous amount of excitement and attention to the idea of disease eradication and elimination. In the twentieth century alone, smallpox had claimed the lives of more than 300,000,000 people (Sneed A, Scientific American, https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/who-remember-smallpox/ , 2014). The last natural case occurred in 1977, almost 200\\xa0years after the smallpox vaccine was discovered, and in 1979 the World Health Organization declared that the disease had been eradicated (WHO, Smallpox, World Health Organization. World Health Organization. https://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/en/ , 2019c). Most importantly, it demonstrated that eradication was possible; that through the use of science, we could change our future for the better in ways that we had not even dared to think about previously. This achievement also helped to focus attention on clear definitions of disease eradication and elimination. Since then, these definitions have been continuously evolving. In 1993, the International Task Force for Disease Eradication (ITFDE I) defined disease control, elimination, and eradication. With that, they evaluated over 90 potential infectious disease candidates and concluded that six were eradicable. Subsequently in 1997, the Dahlem Workshop focused on the science of eradication and defined a range of public health approaches to infectious diseases from control, to elimination of disease, elimination of infections, eradication, and extinction. Three years later, the second International Task Force for Disease Eradication (ITFDE II) convened in 2000 to review the progress over the past decade. Inspired by these efforts, we reviewed our own experience and interviewed leaders of several disease eradication and elimination campaigns to identify lessons learned from a variety of disease elimination campaigns including smallpox, polio, Guinea worm, and onchocerciasis. Our aim was to identify lessons that might be applied to road traffic injuries. We identified 12 lessons from these infectious disease campaigns: (1) this is a cause and effect Cause-and-effect world; (2) know the truth; (3) coalitions are absolutely essential and absolutely hard; (4) avoid certainty (the Achilles heel of science); (5) measure frequently and build in continuous improvement; (6) respect the culture and work with the people you are trying to help; (7) the best decisions are based on the best science, but the best results, on the best management; (8) the best solutions move us closer to global health equity; (9) do not underestimate the time, resources, or tenacity it will take succeed; (10) eradication does not always require a vaccine or a cure; (11) start in the most difficult places first; and (12) you don’t begin at the end. These concepts from infectious disease campaigns have broader public health applications, and we discuss some of the implications for reducing road traffic injuries.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The natural environment has proven to nurture and heal the human mind, body, and spirit and yet, access to nature is often considered a luxury or privilege. Correctional facilities are often places of unrelenting cold, grey environments sited on expanses of lawn or provide no access to the nature at all. This lack of nature in correctional environments is being challenged by criminal justice reform efforts. In this chapter, we provide a framework for designing nature into correctional environments which is grounded in design theories and demonstrated through a series of gardens designed and constructed at the Iowa Correctional Institution for Women. Intentionally transforming the metaphorical and literal grey correctional environment to a green one subsequently holds great promise for the individual physical, emotional, and social health of those who are incarcerated and their lives in the institution and upon return their return to the community. In this chapter we explore what it means to go “from grey to green” and present guidelines on ways in which the biophilic, therapeutic, universal, attention restoration theory, and sensory design principles associated with health-promoting environments can be applied to outdoor prison design as a means to support wellbeing for incarcerated individuals.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The proportion of older people is continuously growing worldwide. This demographic phenomenon threatens the sustainability of our healthcare systems. The healthcare systems were initially designed for a population of patients (i.e., younger, with lower clinical complexity, and affected by acute conditions) utterly different from that referred today to the clinical and social services (i.e., much older, with high clinical complexity, and characterized by multiple chronic conditions). In this context, frailty (i.e., a geriatric condition defined by the age-related reduction of physiological reserves, exposing the individual to an increased vulnerability to exogenous and endogenous stressors) becomes of particular interest. Frailty introduces in the medical nomenclature a way for overcoming the traditional, but obsolete nosological constructs, shifting the clinician’s focus from the concept of “disease” to that of “function.” At the same time, it might provide a way for levering the entire healthcare system toward a more person-centered approach, stimulating multidisciplinary interactions and integration of services. In the present chapter, the concept of frailty is presented in its definition as well as in its clinical and public health relevance. Screening, assessment, and management methods are provided.',\n",

De paradigmaverschuiving van ziekte en zorg naar gezondheid, gedrag en maatschappij is zowel voor ergotherapeuten als voor andere professionals een belangrijke transitie.

Daarbij gaat het om deel te kunnen (blijven) nemen aan de activiteiten die voor een persoon van betekenis zijn, het participeren in het dagelijks en maatschappelijk leven.

       "  'abstract': 'Globally, a continuous and swift increase in population raised the water demand. Due to scarcity in available freshwater resources, ground water turned out to be a key source of water for crop and human consumption. Recently, many groundwater aquifers across the world reported exceeding the limits of the prescribed arsenic level, in turn raising a serious concern on both environment and human health. Arsenic is a ubiquitous metalloid that exists in four different oxidation states inclusive of both metallic and non-metallic characteristics and occurs both in [arsenite (As III ) and arsenate (As V )] and inorganic (monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethyl arsenic acid (DMA)) forms. The arsenite (As III ) form is comparatively more toxic than arsenate (As V ), MMA and DMA. Heavy accumulation of arsenite (As III ) form in the plant tissues stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which in turn affects the membrane stability, permeability, enzyme activity, electron transport chain, and ion homeostasis leading to poor seed germination, growth retardation and yield reduction in plants. In general, arsenite (As III ) form of arsenic predominates in reducing the environment that usually prevails in rice-growing tracts of the world. Rice is the staple food in South East Asian countries viz ., Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Thailand, and Vietnam in turn has a growing concern about arsenic poisoning in the human food chain. In consideration of the associated damage due to arsenic accumulation, many mitigation strategies were devised by several researchers. This chapter focuses on appropriate strategies that could mitigate arsenic toxicity effectively and in a sustainable manner.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'According to the Indian Psychiatric Society, the number of people in India suffering from mental illness has increased by 20% during the pandemic and lockdown. This situation necessitates the use of technology, such as a chatbot. In this paper, the authors proposed a PSYchiatric COvid-19 (PSYCO-19) chatbot which provides mental assistance. The scope of the proposed work covers multidisciplinary areas like psychiatric analysis, mental health, communication system, machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), deep learning (DL), and sentiment analysis (SA). The proposed chatbot has a well-designed architecture with a structured knowledge engine to provide an intuitive interface. The design consists of three components with a good balance of cohesion and articulation through medical knowledge and conversational dialog. It is backed by a bank of structured information resources connected to COrona VIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19). The chatbot also offers mental health counseling and self-assessment exams for mental illnesses, in addition to corona virus information. The novelty of the proposed work is to provide an interface to interact with the virtual avatar in a rich environment supported by voice and language capabilities. It advises the user to consult a medical practitioner to determine whether they are affected with COVID-19 and provide them with recommendations. Along with providing a psychiatric assessment to the end-user and conversation with interactive virtual avatars, the proposed chatbot can understand texts in the English language, with a training accuracy of 66% of the proposed deep learning model.',\n",

With the fastest population growth rate in the EU and a tourism-based economy, some feared that Malta would be heavily impacted by the pandemic. While infection rates were comparable to most European states, the death rate was lower and Malta is projected to be the EU economy least impacted by the pandemic. By May 2021, Malta had the highest vaccination rate in Europe and became the first EU country to reach herd immunity. Malta’s COVID-19 experience can be differentiated into three phases with a series of containment, health and economic measures which were rapidly enacted and enforced through Malta never introduced a total lockdown. As argued in this chapter, Malta’s response was facilitated by its heavily centralised political system and nationalised health care system; in Malta, executive control during the pandemic was clear, unequivocal and rapidly enforced.',\n",

Patient control and monitoring is a vital test framework for physiological signals like electrocardiographs (ECGs), breathing rates, invasive and non-invasive circulatory strain, human blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), and body temperature. PMS continuously examines important physiological signs of the patient during individual care. For healthcare personnel, observing every patient for 24\\xa0h is a bit difficult job. In hospitals, the importance of PMS is high; hence, the manufacturers of clinical equipment have central patient monitoring and tracking systems. All patient screens are connected to one server-based patient monitoring system in centralized patient monitoring systems. The utilization of networking in clinical field has become a major part for any hospital, particularly with respect to crucial issues, similar to information overflow and security issue and so on. So, we are presenting diverse set of networking topology which makes it easy for the hospital staff to manage.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Icelandic response to the corona pandemic was inspired to a great extent by lessons learned during earlier virus outbreaks and the economic melt-down of 2008. Expert advice played a crucial role in formulating policy response along with an emphasis on strong leadership and cushions for badly hit groups. Iceland is a parliamentary democracy where the legislature plays a large role under normal circumstances. The corona crisis, however, saw the postponement of politics to a certain degree where the executive played an unusually assertive role. Key players included not only the cabinet, which was uncharacteristically subdued during the crisis, but a group of experts, key agencies and a private firm specializing in biotechnology. The government emphasized minimizing the social impact of the pandemic and social cohesion through a range of measures. These were largely successful in the short run, although the long-term economic effects remain uncertain.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Breast cancer is the leading cause of death among Hispanic women. The number of Hispanic breast cancer survivors is increasing because the US Hispanic population is fast-growing and breast cancer survival is improving. However, this vulnerable population has received little attention. Obesity and weight gain affect Hispanic and African American/Black women disproportionately. Obesity affects several factors relevant to cancer survivorship, including cancer treatment and patient-reported outcomes such as health-related quality of life (QoL). As a first step toward addressing these issues, a pilot study was conducted to assess the feasibility of assembling a cohort of Hispanic breast cancer survivors in New Jersey. Methods were similar to those used in the ongoing Women’s Circle of Health Follow-Up Study, a cohort of African American/Black breast cancer survivors in New Jersey. Hispanic breast cancer survivors were very interested and willing to participate. There were interesting differences in body mass index and central adiposity between Hispanic and African American/Black breast cancer survivors, but both groups had a high prevalence of body fatness and comorbidities. Hispanic breast cancer survivors had lower QoL, particularly obese women. More research is needed to understand survivorship needs in minority and medically underserved women after a breast cancer diagnosis.',\n",

The Interreg Alpine Space HEALPS2 project relies on a transnational and transversal approach to improve the framework conditions and tools for alpine health tourism, and therefore proposes a communication strategy based on specific objectives. These objectives guide the communication activities at an internal and external level, with the latter being declined for different targets and stakeholders. In this Chapter, the communication activities are described, starting from the general and specific objectives-oriented approach, to the local realization.

       "  'abstract': 'This chapter examines the opportunities available to a range of professions that directly or indirectly influence urban settings, to achieve Vision Zero safety outcomes. Starting with how we want our urban areas to be, the chapter examines options to eliminate the systemic risk of deaths and serious injuries on urban roads from three separate but related viewpoints; managing the threats to life and health posed by the energy embedded within the road transport system, the potential for crashes to occur and the exposure of those who use the system to severe injury risk from crashes. In urban settings, it is sometimes possible to eliminate or minimize vehicular traffic on selected roads and streets but, in general, it is either impractical or undesirable to do so. By physically separating vehicles from other vehicles, and from highly vulnerable road users, we risk creating the types of cities and towns that do not support our high level aspirations of highly liveable and healthy societies, with sustainable and equitable urban transport systems. Where physical separation is not viable, it becomes necessary to manage transport system energy to ensure risk remains below the levels we set for Vision Zero outcomes – no one being killed or seriously injured. The main focus of this chapter therefore is on the means by which we can manage kinetic energy, primarily through compatible combinations of infrastructure design and speed limit setting, to protect all who use urban roads. Vehicle technology and structural design are important considerations for system performance as a whole.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Increasing concerns regarding the status of the environment and food quality contribute to an increasing demand for agricultural products produced by organic agriculture (OA). About 1.6% of the global agricultural land area is currently managed by OA practices. In the twentieth century, pioneers such as Rudolf Steiner, Sir Albert Howard, Lady Eve Balfour, Jerome Irving Rodale and Masanobu Fukuoka developed OA systems in reaction to perceived failures of conventional or nonorganic agriculture. Early types of OA included bio-dynamic, natural, biological, ecological and organic-biological agriculture. The International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) provides a definition of modern OA. However, there is no single interpretation of what OA practices and principles entail, and OA production systems continue to evolve. Among common OA practices are fertilization with organic instead of mineral fertilizers, use of natural-derived instead of synthetic plant protection products, and mechanical instead of chemical crop system management. Importantly, OA is the only farming system whose management practices are codified by law in most countries. However, OA is faced with several challenges such as the 19–25% lower crop yield compared to that under conventional or nonorganic practices, the lack of animal and green manure produced on OA farms to satisfy the demand at other OA farms, and lack of plant and animal varieties specifically adapted to OA soil and land-use management practices. Increased efforts are, thus, needed to improve the contribution of OA systems to environmental health as consumer demand for OA products continues to rise globally.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The second ASCL conference was held in February 2020, about 1\\xa0month after the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was documented in the United States and before evidence of community spread. Since then, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic that has disproportionately infected, hospitalized, and killed ethnic and racial minorities in the United States (Jacobson et al., Am J Prev Med 61(5):644–651, 2021; Moore et al., MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 69:1122–1126, 2020; Shiels et al., Ann Intern Med. https://doi.org/10.7326/m21-2134 , 2021; American Cancer Society, Cancer facts & figures 2021. American Cancer Society, Atlanta, 2021). According to a report of provisional life expectancy estimates from the National Center for Health Statistics, the life expectancy for US Hispanics decreased 3\\xa0years (81.8–78.8) between 2019 and 2020. As a result, the life expectancy advantage held by Hispanics over non-Hispanic whites narrowed by 60%, suggesting poorer health and mortality outcomes for the US Hispanic population. It is estimated that 90% of this decline in the life expectancy gap is the result of mortality caused by COVID-19 (Arias et al., Provisional life expectancy estimates for 2020. National Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville, 2021). Some speculate that this disease disparity exists because Hispanics and other underrepresented groups receive the greatest exposure to the virus. They are more likely to live in densely populated areas and multigenerational households; use public transportation; and have essential public-facing jobs in the service and healthcare sectors, where working from home is not an option (American Cancer Society, Cancer facts & figures 2021. American Cancer Society, Atlanta, 2021; Hooper et al., JAMA 323(24):2466–2467, 2020; Balogun et al., JAMA Oncol 6(10):1531–1532, 2020). If infected, they are also more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 because of comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and other chronic conditions (Hooper et al., JAMA 323(24):2466–2467, 2020).',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Debate regularly existed over the need for temporary Pacific island workers compared with international ‘backpackers’ and local workers. Islanders were often preferred as conscientious workers. Most employment was in New South Wales and Queensland. Labour shortages usually occurred in remote places, and were accentuated after the arrival of COVID-19. Complicated by cultural differences, workers sometimes faced problems arising from overcrowded accommodation, absent local transport, poor health and nutrition and underpaid wages, since regulation was weak. Long hours, climates and unfamiliar crops and processes posed initial problems. Women tended to work indoors in packing sheds. Incomes were considerably more than at home, and remittances were substantial, but work and earnings could be uneven. Problems experienced by workers were similar to those in New Zealand and Canada.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The world has been dealing with an epidemic of undernutrition as a result of population growth, necessitating an increased food supply. The goal of food security is to increase food availability for the population, resulting in a healthier and more favourable imbalance between food demand and supply. Recent advances in food technology, plant breeding, and genetic engineering have enabled places around the world to have enough food, resulting in a reduction in undernutrition and the growth of obesity and non-communicable diseases. Because functional foods can help to alleviate these issues, there is a need to produce more of them in order to ensure that they are used more efficiently and equitably as part of a complex and integrated worldwide plan for global functional food security. Thus all national as well as international agencies should collaborate to educate the global food business and governments about the importance of increasing the production of functional foods. Such attempts to buy or produce have not been made in middle-income countries, resulting in an obesity epidemic, which must be addressed across Africa to prevent obesity. Functional Food Security appears to be sufficient to treat all aspects of global malnutrition, including undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight, obesity, and diet-related National Sustainable Development Strategies (NSDS). This chapter contains a comprehensive view of the kinds of functional foods, their utility as a tool to mitigate nutritional deficiencies and achieve the SDG3 of good health and well-being, their use from a global perspective, and their role in the alleviation of food insecurity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this chapter, we focus on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning (LGBTQ) students in primary and secondary education. Diverse identities of gender and sexuality are realised primarily during adolescence, however sex education features sparsely in the curriculum of primary and secondary schools and is prominently influenced by heteronormative and cisgender ideologies. As such, LGBTQ students are at high risk of experiencing social exclusion and being exposed to discriminatory attitudes and victimisation within the school environment and the broader community. The increasing popularity of social networking sites among adolescents and the growing representation of sexual and gender diversity in popular culture over the past decade have enabled novel avenues of relationships and sex education (RSE) for LGBTQ young people. Through a critical review of the literature, we highlight the benefits and challenges of RSE through formal (school) and informal contexts (social media) for LGBTQ students. We identify gaps in the relevant literature and explore suggestions for further research in LGBTQ-inclusive RSE. We conclude the chapter by discussing the practical implications of the extant literature for LGBTQ-inclusive relationship and sex education for policymakers and educators.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Vision impairment significantly affects the quality of life. It is related to several diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, cataract, and glaucoma. According to World Health Organization (WHO), globally at least 2.2\\xa0billion people have a distance or near vision impairment. Almost in half of these cases, vision impairment has yet to be addressed or it could have been prevented. It includes people with moderate or severe distance vision impairment or blindness due to cataract (94\\xa0million), diabetic retinopathy (3.9\\xa0million), glaucoma (7.7\\xa0million), corneal opacities (4.2\\xa0million), trachoma (two million), or unaddressed refractive error (88.4\\xa0million) and near vision impairment due to unaddressed presbyopia (826\\xa0million). Ocular health has become a major concern lately due to a significant increase in screen time due to the pandemic which has restricted almost everyone to technological devices for their work, education, and all other basic activities. Blue light emitting from the screen can cause damage to the retina if exposed at high intensity in the visible range (390–600\\xa0nm). The damage to the eyes can be controlled or minimized by reducing the oxidative stress on the retinal cells. Several bioactive components and functional foods can help minimize the effect of blue light on the eyes and also reduce the risk or severity of several eye-related disorders.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Among Hispanic women, breast cancer is the most common cancer accounting for close to 30% of the total cancer cases. It is estimated that in 2018 alone, 24,000 Hispanics were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. Of significant importance is that breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death (16%) among Hispanic women, with over 3000 patients dying in 2018 secondary to this disease. Despite the decrease in breast cancer mortality rates seen in recent years, the magnitude of that decrease among Hispanics is lower compared to the decrease seen among non-Hispanic White women (1.1% per year vs 1.8% per year). Potential contributing factors associated with this phenomenon include the fact that Hispanics are more likely to be diagnosed with more advanced stages and to have tumors with aggressive biology. In addition, sociodemographic factors and difficulty accessing medical care are likely to play an important role. It has been described that Hispanic women are less likely that non-Hispanic Whites to receive appropriate and timely breast cancer treatment. In this chapter, we will review the complexities of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. We will briefly review some of the challenges in cancer care delivery that Hispanics experience and will review data describing the detrimental impact that treatment delays can have among minorities and some of the unique challenges that Hispanics experience.',\n",

However, traditional approaches to multi-robot use do not take into account the effects of a variety of hostile environmental conditions in the real world on robot health and overall system work performance. To solve these issues, we propose a control algorithm for a multi-robot overlay system with optimal health management. Firstly, the CVT-based control method for the multi-robot overlay system is introduced to provide the optimal configuration for the multi-robots in the overlay system while minimizing the cost function, and make real-time changes according to changes in the external environment; secondly, in this paper, we come up with a multi-robot health optimization management algorithm in which we optimize the health wastage value of the robot by making minor modifications to the original framework, and the impact of environmental restrictions on the coverage system is reduced, thus, the overall performance of multi-robot formations is improved. The algorithm was proven to be effective through simulation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Health care is one of the most significant areas to be focused on and which can be developed through innovative technology. Digitization of the health sector has been on for a long time. The use of smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices is now used extensively. Communication between patients and their doctors has been made much easier and flexible through available mobile applications (app). So, the barrier of distance between patient and doctor has been eliminated. Mobile apps are convenient in clinical diagnosis and evaluation, timely advice, medicine prescription, and the distant monitoring of patients from various areas. The patient can able to share the medical information about the health condition securely through the developed mobile application. By this means, traveling a long distance and visiting the doctor for a regular checkup may be evaded. This chapter stretches a thorough description of a mobile app developed for the virtual patient monitoring system. A novel solution is proposed to monitor the most important health parameters of a patient using wearable sensors and images obtained using medical equipment. The mobile app supports receiving vital parameters such as body temperature, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation level from the wearable sensor node placed in the vicinity of a patient. Hence, developed application assists the doctor in the early prediction of the disease. It can able to analyze a patient’s health status by comparing it with their previous history. Further, the application helps to send alert notifications or short messaging services (SMS) to the patient for emergency physical examination. An elderly patient finds difficulty in visiting clinics for a regular checkup and also finds difficulty in staying in hospital for a longer duration. Thus, proposed and developed mobile application makes it convenient to monitor health status for any patient who are staying with limited access to the medical facility.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'One of the problems generated by the COVID-19 disease is the negative impact that the infodemic causes on people. The infodemic is generated from the excess of information and misinformation that increases exponentially. As a consequence, the infodemic makes it difficult to find reliable sources of information and to obtain information validated by experts in the medical field, which is accessible and understandable to all. One of the strategies used to address this problem is the use of specialized information systems that provide support to reduce disinformation and to disseminate reliable information. In order to address this problem, this paper presents: i) a process model based on filtering by health professionals, structuring by communication professionals and acquisition of customized information based on users preferences, to manage information on the COVID-19 disease for a specific community, ii) the design of a system that implements the proposed process to generate reliable and quality information accessible to the target audience and, iii) the development and preliminary evaluation of the information filtering system on the COVID-19 disease, as a proof of concept that implements some of the main activities of the proposed process. The results of this preliminary evaluation with health professionals are promising, as they provide evidence of the usefulness and ease of use of the system to generate reliable and quality information. Finally, a set of insights is presented for filtering information for the design of systems that seek to provide support to reduce the negative impact of the infodemic.',\n",

The chapter is composed of five sections. The first is an overview of the geographic distribution, demographic composition, and intrafaith diversity of Muslims around the world. The second section reviews key Muslim religious/spiritual beliefs, teachings, practices, and texts. The third section discusses common Muslim understandings of virtues, health, and well-being. The fourth section reviews potential implications for science and practice at the intersections of positive psychology, religion, and spirituality. The final section offers recommendations for guiding research and practice when working with Muslims at these intersections.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Shift work can have several impacts not only on the health and family and social life of the workers, but also at the organizational level. The literature has revealed that shifts involving night work and/or periods that are highly valued from a family and social point of view, such as weekends, are the most disruptive. In this paper, the results of an open-ended question about the experience of working in shifts and the impact that COVID-19 had on the lives of workers, at the time of data collection, have been presented and discussed. For that, the answers of 123 shift workers (98 involving nights and 25 without involving nights) were compared with the answers of 33\\xa0day workers. Negative impacts of working hours on health, family life as well as at the organizational level were reported mostly by shift workers. Reduction in working hours, teleworking, or flexible working hours were presented as some of the main strategies to reduce the effects of working hours. Finally, from the perspective of workers, COVID-19 has resulted in greater workload and greater work demands as well as causing family and health problems.',\n",

In fact, the virus seemed to have serious social effects especially on poor people, which demand specific measures urgently by public authorities. This chapter covers the period from March 2020, when the pandemic began in Morocco, to the end of May 2022. The study period is admittedly short, but it seemed sufficient for drawing the first lessons on the effects of the pandemic on poverty. However, these are politics from pre-COVID-19 times, and the main strategy is to expand rather than reform the old model, even though the institutions themselves have identified new forms of poverty. Moreover, public actors have not provided conclusive evidence of their strategy’s viability. If the coronavirus pandemic has only made more visible the limits and contradictions of the fight against poverty in the country, the public and institutional debate in Morocco is still on the search for the status of the poor. Overall, the COVID-19 crisis has been used as a window of opportunity to reveal the flimsy nature of social cohesion in morocco and the challenges the challenges to be overcome.',\n",

It recognizes that policy ideas are embedded in policy paradigms and that these paradigms form the basis for framing, articulating and implementing public policy. It examines such concepts as pluralism, internationalization and globalization, and polycentricism in the study of public policy. Furthermore, it examines the changing focus and locus of policy discussing such issues as the state versus market, the growing complexity and scale of government and the special concerns of Africans relating to the debate around the issues. Based on the above theoretical debates, certain issues and the competing tools for addressing them are identified for closer scrutiny. These contextual issues include the economic issues in public policy; health issues and public policy; security issues and public policy; the environment and natural resources policy issues; governance and policy issues; and exclusion, vulnerability and public policy.

It discusses how she appeared on primarily Tumblr and Instagram, exploring the general sad girl discourses on these platforms as well as some examples that received extra attention. These include the artist Audrey Wollen and her sad girl theory, the girl group Sad Girls Y Qué, the Instagram club Sad Girls Club, the social media brand My Therapist Says, and prominent Instagram accounts. Here I look at the critical and acritical tendencies within the figure, acknowledging both the potentially subversive aspects of the activist-oriented sad girls and the more commercialized versions of popular sad girls.

       "  'abstract': 'The Internet of things (IoT) has made healthcare applications more accessible to the rest of the globe. On a wide scale, IoT has been employed to interconnect therapeutic aids in order to provide world-class healthcare services. The novel sensing devices can be worn to continuously measure and monitor the participants’ vital parameters. Remotely monitored parameters can be transferred to medical servers via the Internet of things, which can then be analyzed by clinicians. Furthermore, machine learning algorithms can make real-time decisions on the abnormal character of health data in order to predict disease early. This study presents a machine learning and Internet of things (IoT)-based health monitoring system to let people measure health metrics quickly. Physicians would also benefit from being able to monitor their patients remotely for more personalized care. In the event of an emergency, physicians can respond quickly. In this study, the Espressif modules 8266 are used to link health parameter sensors, which are implanted to measure data and broadcast it to a server. With the real-time data from the sensors, three statistical models were trained to detect anomalous health conditions in the patients: K-nearest neighbors (KNNs), logistic regression, and support vector machine (SVM). Due to abnormal health markers, these models uncover patterns during training and forecast disease in the subject.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The novel 2019 Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has revealed numerous challenges in coordinating and arranging hospital spaces at both national and international level. The overwhelming number of hospital admissions of people affected by COVID-19 has highlighted difficulties in managing, updating, and refurbishing healthcare spaces. The objective of this study is to provide meta-design indications that demonstrate the value of spatial design in containing pandemic health emergencies and improving quality for different healthcare users. Utilized research methods include a review of existing literature on the current state of the art, analysis of design solutions that emerged in response to past pandemics and comparison of existing planning tools on the subject. Additionally, given the contemporaneity of the issue, a cross-sectional survey was used to collect and compare the experiences and design strategies adopted by some selected Italian hospital. The results of the study highlight the most effective and recurrent solutions that have supported health action in the fight against COVID-19. Emphasis was placed on solutions with a human-centered approach, as well as those that seek to promote the physical and psychological well-being of all users involved. In conclusion, the resulting meta-design indications represent a starting point for developing detailed design solution to enhance pandemic readiness. Additional research is needed to support healthcare facilities in becoming more welcoming and efficient while improving COVID-19 patient care and protecting healthcare workers.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'To optimize engagement of Latino communities in cancer research, University of Southern California researchers are working with communities on prevention of cervical cancer, a highly preventable and treatable disease. Two recent studies from their signature initiatives, Es Tiempo and Tamale Lesson , are presented to illustrate the situation in the Latino community regarding\\xa0the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and cervical cancer screening. These population-based studies included promotores de salud\\xa0(lay community health workers) and community members who were engaged from conceptualization, recruitment, translation, cultural adaptation, information dissemination, and other important aspects of the research. A third exploratory effort used virtual reality as a research tool to better understand vaccine hesitancy, especially among boys and explored end-of-life quality improvements for immigrant Latino populations. These studies serve as a backdrop for discussing common strategies to increase participation in cancer research in key areas such as information delivery, consultation with stakeholders and partners, and collaboration with community opinion leaders. Strategies are discussed, which optimize engagement in cancer research, stimulate communication, and empower participants to engage in research. These strategies shape attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors, improving outcomes for Latinas at risk of cervical and other HPV-related cancers.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This article investigates user’s health data and location in real-time on the Thingsboard visualization platform. The Internet of medical Things (IoMT) is the focus of the next age of healthcare, based on preventative and predictive analytics. The most impacting sectors of interest in healthcare, behavioral, ambient, and physiological domains, must be monitored on a big scale and in a broad sense. Wearables serve an essential role in data collecting and measurement in customized healthcare monitoring. We want to build a platform that can be customized and adapted to track a wide range of metrics in a comfortable way. However, by incorporating the Internet of things into the health monitoring system, the procedures of health monitoring may be automated, saving the patient valuable time. Furthermore, the cloud, which revolutionized data storage, contributes in the development of a better and more dependable health monitoring system. Real-time storage and visualization of health data is possible. A NodeMCU is utilized as a gateway to gather the user’s health data, and a Raspberry Pi 4 Model broker is used as the central processing unit to analyze all of the data collected in this project. The broker receives and processes health data from the gateway. Using the Google geolocation service, the system is able to monitor the user’s position. The user’s health data and location are shown in real-time on the Thingsboard visualization platform. On the suggested system, many experiments and tests, such as accuracy testing and error analysis, were undertaken, with positive results.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The competitiveness of nature-based Health Tourism (NHT) industry, especially in the Alpine regions, is increasingly linked to the sustainability and exploitation of unique natural resources of tourism destinations, which often lack the access to knowledge and networks of stakeholders to improve their offerings. In this sense, the use of digital tools can open up further opportunities to reconsider value offerings and better access different knowledge resources and relationships within the industry network. This Chapter illustrates the collaborative design approach adopted in HEALPS2 for the development of an ontology-based Decision Support System for health tourism destinations. The resulting ontology aims to model the relationships between the available natural resources, the value offerings and the target groups of NHT destinations. Moreover, the Collaborative Design approach foresees the involvement of end-users (i.e. not only tourism destinations, but also the network of stakeholders, and the actual and potential future tourists) as both sources of knowledge and validators of the ontology and its outputs, aiming to inform decision-making processes in a shared knowledge model that leverages on digital tools.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This chapter proposes a method for characterising youth custodial facilities across jurisdictions, regimes, and cohorts, with the objective of providing well evidenced and concrete guidance for the design of youth custodial facilities. Academic literature on effective treatment approaches for justice-involved young people supports a focus on therapeutic, tailored approaches that build and strengthen positive youth development, social support networks, and commitment to school or work. By establishing the design implications which follow from this evidence, a series of key characteristics emerge that define a best-practice, theoretical facility model: small-scale, locally sited, and integrated with the surrounding community, designed to promote relational and differentiated security, and comprising therapeutic design characteristics. We explored each of the characteristics in three well-regarded European jurisdictions: Spain, Norway, and the Netherlands. Our observations substantiate the theoretical facility model as a valuable tool for drawing into view the tensions, opportunities, strengths, and weaknesses of a design, relative to the facility’s given context. Our findings highlight the importance of carefully considering the design of youth justice facilities in terms of the desired outcomes as they greatly impact upon procedures and ways of working within these facilities, and ultimately impact the outcomes for young people and the community.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The French response to the pandemic took place within a pre-existing institutional framework, highly centralized and conducted directly by the President of the Republic. This degree of centralization, sometimes personalized by the President himself, fuelled in turn a specific kind of politicization, featuring opposing favourable and critical views on the role of the President, rather than clear partisan options. Even though most French people have globally adhered to the measures taken, through their behaviour and their opinions, many debates and public controversies arose in this politicized landscape. This can be observed at different moments of the pandemic, the management of which mobilized, like in most countries, a comprehensive set of public instruments, both sanitary and economic.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The late-2019 Covid-19 outbreak has shifted global attention to social media. Governments used social media to raise public health awareness. However, the internet was flooded with disinformation and conspiracy theories, among other things. This condition may cause unwarranted alarm, compromising the health system and damaging the mental health of social media users, especially young people who dominate the internet population. The function of social media in spreading fear during this epidemic must be investigated. This study’s goal is to see how social media might spread fear among Malaysian young people. A total of 400 university students took part in this online survey. The results show that fake news, mental health and anxiety, changes in public behaviour and sharing information are significantly related to panic behaviour.

       "  'abstract': 'Data-driven health care is truly valuable and promising. As long as relevant data are gathered, probed, used, and managed in a good fashion, significant improvements in the dependability of healthcare practices are achievable. Nevertheless, unless privacy facets of relevant sensitive data are addressed, there are notable concerns regarding data-driven healthcare policies and applications. In general, technical and engineering facets of such interventions are concentered on to a greater extent, but privacy facets are not adequately addressed. This chapter highlights and discusses privacy issues in data-driven health care. A comprehensive review and distillation of pertinent literature and works yielded relevant results and interpretations. Purposefully, generic privacy issues are elaborated in the beginning. Additionally, areas for improvement regarding privacy issues in data-driven health care are underlined and discussed. People, policy, and technology aspects are also explained and deliberated. Moreover, how privacy is related to people and policy to ensure the success in data-driven healthcare practices is discussed in this chapter. Besides, people’s perceptions about privacy are distilled and reported. The focal impact of this chapter is to deliver a contemporary interpretation and discussion regarding privacy issues in data-driven health care. Product developers and managers, policy-makers, and pertinent researchers might benefit from this chapter in order to improve related knowledge and implementations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Deep learning sequential models are increasingly being used to predict patients’ health outcomes by analyzing their medical histories. In this paper, we investigate the design decisions and challenges of using deep learning sequential models for predictive health modeling. Our results show that the most successful deep learning health models to date, called transformers, lack a mechanism to analyze the temporal characteristics of health records. To address this gap, we propose and evaluate a new model called DTTHRE: Decoder Transformer for Temporally Embedded Health Records Encoding. DTTHRE analyzes patients’ medical histories, including the elapsed time between visits. We also evaluate the performance of DTTHRE on a real-world medical dataset for two health outcomes: (1) diagnostic and (2) readmission prediction. DTTHRE successfully predicted patients’ final diagnosis (78.54 ± 0.22%) and readmission risk (99.91 ± 0.02%) with improved performance compared to existing deep learning sequential models in the literature. DTTHRE predicts the health outcome for each medical visit, which increases the training examples available from limited medical datasets with no additional training time.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The construction industry is considered one of the most dangerous industries due to its hazardous nature of work. Currently, the health and safety procedures in the construction industry are observed to be low in most parts of the world. The impacts of COVID-19 have extensively revealed the lack of preparedness in health and safety procedures in the industry. Even before COVID-19, dengue outbreaks have posed a significant threat to the industry. In such as a\\xa0context, this study has aimed at identifying the current practices in the construction industry for enhancing the level of health and safety in construction sites for biological hazards\\xa0and challenges in implementing those practices. The study has drawn on a focus group discussion considering dengue outbreaks in Sri Lanka as a case in point and a systematic literature review that consists of 21 publications on biological hazards in construction sites. According to the findings, current practices can be identified under four groups namely,\\xa0hazard elimination, engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment (PPE). In implementing these practices, the lack of guidance, inadequate compliance to safety procedures, cost implications, and breakdowns in supply of PPE act as the main challenges. Although some measures are frequently practiced in awake of COVID-19, the long-term run of those measures can pose several consequences. It highlights the need for long-term planning in regard to biological hazard preparedness in construction sites. The paper presents a framework that can be followed in developing a code of practice for biological hazard preparedness of the construction industry. The proposed framework assists policymakers in shaping up the current health and safety procedures into a sustainable stage.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Occupational risk assessment is now the main element of the occupational health management system. It helps reduce the likelihood of accidents and occupational diseases in the workplace. This effect is most relevant for the transport industry. When constructing a risk-oriented evaluation algorithm for noise reduction measures as the most harmful factor in transport enterprises, a risk pyramid is considered. A methodology for studying the values of harmful production factors as a problem with a complex of several output parameters using the normalization method is presented. A method for assessing the probability of risk using the generalized Harrington desirability function is considered. It is based on the method of converting the natural values of the partial output parameters into a dimensionless scale. The selection of measures to reduce the impact of noise was made on the basis of risk analysis according to the pyramid of G.Z. Feinburg. As a result of the study, the proposed noise reduction measures at transport enterprises are evaluated in terms of reducing occupational risk. This will reduce the risk of accidents and occupational diseases in the transport industry.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Building thriving smart cities necessitates suitable infrastructure; life-enhancing and life-saving technologies, including the Internet of medical things (IoMT) and edge computing. More bandwidth and supercomputing are needed to improve the quality of service (QoS) required under smart cities. Connecting the Internet of things (IoT) to high-performance computing machines close to healthcare service devices, known as “edge processing,” is a form of supercomputing. Edge computing is required for healthcare applications that demand low network latencies. Reduced latency, energy efficiency, scalability, and bandwidth are all possible with edge computing. For the development and usage of the community health service system, the hospital information system is essential. However, the interoperability of diverse information systems is difficult to implement because it is not enough to manage health information in depth. A study of medical-specific 5G-enabled edge computing architecture is developed to address the problems and facilitate by sharing the health data of patients with doctors for better results and medical services.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Despite Vision Zero’s moral appeal and its expansion throughout the world, it has been criticized on different grounds. This chapter is based on an extensive literature search for criticism of Vision Zero, using the bibliographic databases Philosopher’s Index, Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Phil Papers, and by following the references in the collected documents. Even if the primary emphasis was on Vision Zero in road traffic, our search also included documents criticizing Vision Zero policies in other safety areas, such as public health, the construction and mining industries, and workplaces in general. Based on the findings, we identify and systematically characterize and classify the major arguments that have been put forward against Vision Zero. The most important arguments against Vision Zero can be divided into three major categories: moral arguments, arguments concerning the (goal-setting) rationality of Vision Zero, and arguments aimed at the practical implementation of the goals. We also assess the arguments. Of the 13 identified main arguments, 6 were found to be useful for a constructive discussion on safety improvements.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'By the end of 2020, over 1.8 million Americans will be diagnosed with cancer and 600,000 will die from the disease. Despite experiencing lower incidence rates of cancer compared to non-Hispanic Whites, the Hispanic population in the United States faces a number of barriers to care, which may result in more involved, costlier, and potentially less successful treatments. Hispanic men in particular experience disproportionate cancer-related health disparities compared to other racial and ethnic groups and Hispanic women. Hispanic men cancer survivors (HMCS) have unique supportive care needs and use a variety of coping mechanisms, which remain largely unaccounted for and unaddressed. This chapter presents a brief description of cancer epidemiology and relevant disparities in diagnosis and care for the Hispanic population in the United States. It also explores merging research centered on preliminary data about the supportive care needs of HMCS and concludes with recommendations for public health research and practice.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The term smart city was first coined in the early 1990s. Along with the infrastructure and structural facility, it specifically utilizes a plethora of information technology (IT) innovations and technologies, which are now getting more and more embedded in our daily lives at a breath-taking speed to make cities smarter for the citizens. Smart cities utilize technology-based services and collective knowledge to improve citizens’ efficiency and quality of life (QoL). In this context, the aim of this chapter is to introduce the basic paradigm, tools, and technologies required for monitoring different dynamics of a city (e.g., pollution, traffic condition, road condition, and citizens’ health) using Internet of things (IoT)-based crowd/participatory sensing. There are a variety of smart city applications, some of which are briefly discussed in this chapter. Acquiring data from various dynamics via crowdsensing or participatory sensing is a critical criterion for creating smart environments. Feedback generation over transient data can generate a more efficient system for the smart solution of different technologies. In this chapter, an IoT–cloud-based end-to-end architecture is presented for this purpose. In addition, some open research issues and constraints are also presented to direct future researchers.',\n",

Not only do the policies, practices, and procedures of doctoral education shape the development of prospective scholars, they also determine who is granted access to research training, who succeeds within their academic programs, and who ultimately aspires to and obtains a faculty position. The purpose of this chapter is to review existing knowledge about the role of graduate-level training in the development of college and university faculty in the USA, offering a critical examination of academic pathways and establishing future directions for research. We review this literature against a backdrop of structural inequity, academic capitalism, inequitable access to academic and social capital, and student agency. We point to larger forces and specific practices that contribute to social reproduction within the academy, as well as those that have potential to restructure training and scholarship within academic disciplines. This chapter identifies cross-cutting themes that reflect ongoing challenges in understanding the convergence of institutional, disciplinary, and societal structures with the agency of individuals whose array of identities, motivations, goals, and needs are their own .',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The quality-assurance of measurement in person-centered care (PCC) – is introduced firstly by “bookending” the topic in the overall context of the quality assurance of the care itself. At the start the chapter we ask: What are the end-user objects and constructs of PCC – for instance as specified by the profession and in legislation? At the end: What decisions about PCC objects and constructs can be made and how reliable are they? Examples and illustrations from PCC have included (i) neuropsychological cases (dealt with in more detail in the accompanying chapter by Melin and Pendrill (Person centered outcome metrology. Springer, 2022)) and (ii) patient participation. In the two central sections of the chapter, assuring the quality of measurement in PCC has obliged consideration of how traditional metrological concepts – particularly metrological references for comparability via traceability and reliable estimates of uncertainty – need to be extended. In providing an overview of the benefits of combining Rasch measurement theory and quality assurance, the unique properties of Rasch Measurement Theory are exploited to the full. Replacing the instrument at the heart of a traditional measurement system with a human being provides a truly “person-centered” model of the metrology. This in turn enables a viable procedure to establish metrological references in fields such as PCC in the form of “recipes” analogous to certified reference materials or procedures in analytical chemistry and materials science. It also informs the measurement uncertainties which determine the final decisions about PCC taken at the end of the chapter.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'For a majority of individuals, either severely injured or deceased in residential fires, individual and environmental factors that increase risk are identifiable. Therefore, in order to further reduce injury, there is a need for fire safety programmes that target these individuals and groups. This chapter aims to shed light on how vulnerability to residential fires can be understood and present the basic assumptions for designing programmes targeting these individuals and groups. The problem is complex, requiring knowledge from several fields, and inspiration is drawn from public health, injury prevention and engineering. The chapter presents previous research on the topic, cases that exemplify implementation and the main barriers and facilitators for implementations.',\n",

Artificial Intelligence is reshaping the healthcare industry from hospital care to clinical research, drug development, to insurance, and has been able to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. Most AI system works as a black box with little or no explanation which results in a lack of trust and accountability among patients and doctors. This chapter is written with the intent to share with the audience how exquisitely the health care sector has integrated with the technology. The chapter initiates with a brief description of the use of Artificial intelligence and technology in the health domain, and how computers are helping not only doctors, but patients, health care departments, and Insurance companies. This chapter later focuses on various AI-driven Applications which are used for patient care and treatment.

       "  'abstract': 'Recent advancements in sensor technology, as well as fast progress in internet-based cloud computation; data-driven approaches in structural health monitoring (SHM) are gaining prominence. The majority of time is utilized for reviewing & analyzing the data received from various sensors deployed in structures. This data analysis helps in understating the structural stability and its current state with certain limitations. Considering this fact, integration with Machine Learning (ML) in SHM has attracted significant attention among researchers. This paper is principally aimed at understanding and reviewing of vast literature available in sensor-based data-driven approaches using ML. The implementation and methodology of vibration-based, vision-based monitoring, along with some of the ML algorithms used for SHM are discussed. Nevertheless, a perspective on the importance of data-driven SHM in the future is also presented. Conclusions are drawn from the review discuss the prospects and potential limitations of ML approaches in data-driven SHM applications.',\n",

While repatriation is considered a durable solution for displaced persons, the task of returning people who have been forced to move internally or across international borders in search of greater safety once conflict ends is not an easy one. The process of successful repatriation has numerous critical elements: coordination of peace deals by nation states, political reconciliation, the establishment of clear and safe conditions for voluntary return, the rebuilding and support of post-conflict communities, the ongoing protection and safety of returnees, and the provision of shelter and other resources to meet the immediate and long-term needs of returnees.

The existence of different archetypes, which have several legacy systems and which, in many cases, are difficult to be used, makes the environment even more challenging for healthcare organizations to create innovative solutions. This article aimed to map the software architectures related to Brazil’s Unified Health System (in Portuguese, Sistema Único de Saúde - SUS), using a systematic literature review as a procedure. To this end, an exploratory and descriptive study with a qualitative approach was developed based on the collection and analysis of secondary data. Among the results, seven architectures stood out in the context of Brazilian public health, as well as efforts to develop a flexible and comprehensive software architecture were observed, with less bureaucracy, correction of flaws in real-time, and prioritizing a responsive and resolutive system. This study contributed both to professionals and researchers by providing a document that brings together the existing architectures, highlighting the main points of each one and identifying the existing gaps.',\n",

It found that some victims preferred to take risks, indicating low hazard awareness, while others were ignorant and did not know the causes of the accidents even after their injuries. Furthermore, many employers’ hazard awareness is low because they do not aware of hazardous areas.

Disruption in the key lifestyle patterns like sleep, physical activity, and screen viewing may result in behavioral health impairments as these correspond to the utmost engaged times during the day. This work uses real-time features of physical activity, sleeping habits, and screen viewing to assess the behavioral health of 24 youths. Data is acquired from participants’ smartphones and smartwatches and behavioral health scores are evaluated based on the extracted features. Three statistical feature filtering methods have been used for feature selection, viz. correlation attribute evaluator, information gain, and gain ratio. The features selected by these attribute evaluators have been used to train supervised learning algorithms including four baseline machine learning algorithms and two deep learning algorithms. The best performance is reported by random forest and convolutional neural network with the performance accuracy of 93.06% and 96.77%, respectively, for the prediction of behavioral health.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Finnish governments have utilised a ‘stick and carrot’ approach to prolong work careers at the end by both increasing the official retirement age and offering financial incentives for people to work longer. This chapter explores Finnish male metalworkers’ and engineers’ thoughts regarding retirement and prolonging their careers in terms of how men’s motives change as they approach retirement age. Our interviews (conducted in 2010/2011 and 2017) indicated in both groups that the men had lost a great deal of their interest in work and most of them were ready to retire. Rather than focusing on their work ability, both metalworkers and engineers considered it important to secure sufficient health for life in retirement. Quite surprisingly, economic incentives did not seem to play a role in these men’s considerations of retirement in either of the groups, even despite the substantial income differences between them. Instead of additional money, the interviewees thought about their retirement plans in terms of health, mental wellbeing and work-related satisfaction. Our study suggests that future efforts to prolong work careers should therefore focus on improving working conditions and age-friendly work environments.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The quality of healthcare is highly dependent on nurses’ performance and efficiency. In recent years, hospital information systems (HIS), healthcare software and applications have been introduced to enhance their ability and nurses have a key role in accepting and evaluating the HIS. This study tested psychometric properties and validation of a Persian version of the “Health Information Technology Usability Evaluation Scale” (Health-ITUES). Expert panel, which consisted of 10 nursing professors, assessed the content and face validity of the Persian Health-ITUES. Sample of the was 229 nurses employed in hospitals. Cronbach’s alpha was used to test reliability along with “confirmatory factor analysis” (CFA) was used to test construct validity. Further, both discriminant and convergent validity were assessed. Content validity index (CVI) and content validity ratio (CVR) were .93 and .75 respectively. Scale content validity index (S-CVI) and item content validity index (I-CVI) were more than thresholds (.76 and .90, respectively). Goodness of fit indexes revealed the measurement model was fitted to data well (χ2/DF\\u2009=\\u20092.49, IFI\\u2009=\\u2009.939, CFI\\u2009=\\u2009.938, GFI\\u2009=\\u2009.903, RMSEA\\u2009=\\u2009.076). Cronbach’s alpha values of the factors and total scale were ranged between .75 and .94. The results indicated that Persian version of the health-ITUES is a reliable and valid tool to measure information technology usability in nursing field. We recommend to researchers, health and nursing application developers to use iterative usability evaluation with HITUES to identify problems in early developing steps and address user-centered design.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Diabetes has been on the rise around the world, especially in Saudi Arabia, where the changing lifestyle is pushing the nation towards being more sedentary without cutting back on calorie consumption. It has become imperative for Saudi Arabia to provide self-empowerment opportunities for its citizens in order to monitor their blood glucose levels. An effective method for monitoring blood glucose levels is using Internet of Things Enabled Continuous Glucose Monitors (IoT-CGM), but there are concerns of adoption as it is heavily reliant on an emerging application of technology. This study proposes an adoption model for IoT-CGMs, which has been named Intention to Adopt IoT-enabled Continuous Glucose Monitors (IAI-CGM). The IAI-CGM is based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and takes three factors into consideration; Practical, Technological, and User Behaviour. The model hypotheses the relationship between the constructs of each of the factors with adoption intention. The model is being developed for the Saudi Arabian population to lay the groundworks for future development. The method by which IAI-CGM framework has been developed is based on identifying the factors of adoption from the literature review. Particularly, TAM, and technology adoption intentions in Saudi Arabia have significant contribution to the development of IAI-CGM. It is expected that using this framework, the readiness for Saudi Arabian T1DM patients to adopt IoT-CGMs can be determined. The study is the first of its kind, and therefore has novel implications for the development of similar frameworks for wearable or attached health monitoring devices for other diseases, and for patients in other regions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Sex work was decriminalised in New Zealand in June 2003 by the Prostitution Reform Act [2003] (‘PRA’). It allows citizens and permanent residents over the age of 18 to participate in sex work, whether as sex workers, buyers of sex or brothel operators, without criminal sanction. Decriminalisation allows brothels to be considered as ‘businesses like any other’, allowing them to be\\xa0subject to the same laws that govern businesses in other sectors. Decriminalisation in New Zealand establishes the conditions under which sex workers’ wellbeing, safety and sexual health can be facilitated. Because sex work no longer needs to be conducted invisibly, decriminalisation can destabilise the conditions in which sex workers are subject to violence, blackmail and coercion. This chapter looks at how decriminalisation is positioned in contrast to other models of sex work governance, and examines the provisions of the PRA. It sets out the contours of the New Zealand brothel sector and provides an overview of the managed sex industry in New Zealand\\xa0post-decriminalisation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) via data-driven techniques can be based upon vibrations acquired by sensor networks. However, technical and economic reasons may prevent the deployment of pervasive sensor networks over civil structures, thus limiting their reliability in terms of damage detection. Moreover, the effects of environmental (and operational) variability may lead to false alarms. To address these challenges, a multi-stage machine learning (ML) method is here proposed by exploiting autoregressive (AR) spectra as damage-sensitive features. The proposed method is framed as follows: (i) computing the distances between different sets of the AR spectra via the log-spectral distance (LSD), providing also the training and test datasets; (ii) removing the potential environmental variability by an auto-associative artificial neural network (AANN), to set normalized training and test datasets; (iii) running a statistical analysis via the Mahalanobis-squared distance (MSD) for early damage detection. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is assessed in the case of limited vibration data for the laboratory truss structure known as the Wooden Bridge. Comparative studies show that the AR spectrum is a reliable feature, sensitive to damage even in the presence of a limited number of sensors in the network; additionally, the multi-stage ML methodology succeeds in early detecting damage under environmental variability.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Access to healthcare is deeply conditioned by several social factors such as health policies and economic conditions but, undoubtedly, hospitals are recognized worldwide as the symbol of the healthcare system in its maximum complexity and they are services that will never decay. Since their origins, they represent the social community and, in the socio-cultural context, the original values of interdependence and solidarity. They embody the permeability and availability of entertainment and cultural activities in order to respond to the community’s needs. Starting from the evolution of hospital design, currently healthcare facilities are spaces for care but they also host research and education areas, workplaces, public spaces, etc. As healing places, they require specific considerations in the project design to mitigate the sense of isolation and disorientation, to ease concerns and promote health. As the Scientific Community highlighted, nowadays the quality of spaces plays a key-role in the medical processes, contributing both to improve the experience and comfort perceived by users and to improve the efficiency of staff. For this reason, hospital planners and stakeholders are called to act and to give rise to user-centred system in terms of comfort, efficiency, organizational and operational effectiveness, with an evidence based design approach. Therefore, the scope of this contribution is to argue the evolution of these architectures and to pinpoint the current trends of healthcare design regarding different fields of interest such as building typologies and functional layouts, sustainability, flexibility, soft qualities, innovative materials and the relationship with green.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Estonia successfully curbed the spread of COVID-19 in spring 2020. The government reacted relatively rapidly to the crisis outbreak, declaring an emergency situation on March 12 and introducing measures such as closing schools, banning public gatherings, and restricting movement across borders. Saaremaa, the largest island and the epicenter of the virus, was isolated. A 2 billion-euro aid program was launched, including labor market support, sickness benefits, and tax incentives. Adjustment to the emergency situation was alleviated by Estonia’s advanced digital society. Levels of public compliance with the restrictions were, in general, high. While the government’s handling of the crisis is considered successful overall, the emergency situation facilitated the concentration of power in the hands of the executive. In a situation where normal parliamentary and societal debate were hampered, the government pushed through legislative proposals concerning migration, environment, and social affairs that extended beyond the immediate needs of the pandemic and that undermined democratic values.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The presence and concentrations of heavy metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) were evaluated in five crops that were cultivated in two farmlands impacted by oil spills over the years and a third farm that was 3 km away from an old oil location site using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) and X- Ray Fluorescence (XRF). Most of the data analyses were carried out on results obtained from AAS. The XRF analysis was performed for comparison and it turned out to be a useful tool in this study. Both the AAS and XRF analyses indicated that the soil from the oil site farms contained the greatest concentrations of all elements measured. The pollution load index (PLI) for Fe and Ni was greater than 1 (1.92 and 1.33, respectively), indicating that the soils were contaminated with heavy metals. The pollution concentration factor (PCF) indices for Mn, Ni, and Pb were high for the tuberous crops, while maize was the only crop that had the highest PCF index for Zn from all three farmlands. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) confirmed significant differences ( p \\xa0<\\xa00.001) between the metals and soil. From the Dietary Intake Requirement (DIR) calculations, the annual dietary intakes of Fe, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, and Pb were as high as 255, 195, 137, 150, 71, and 87 (mg/person/year), respectively. These can bioaccumulate in the tissues and organs thus posing health risks to the consumers. White yam had the highest concentrations of these metals and they are in the following order White yam > cassava > three-leaved yam > water yam > maize. Cr, Co, Cu, Cd, and Pb were not detected in the harvested cassava at 18\\xa0months. It is therefore recommended that cassava should be harvested at 18\\xa0months and processed for consumption. The levels of these metals and others should be monitored regularly by agricultural regulatory agencies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The healthcare sector is one of the major sectors affected by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The pandemic brought enormous pressure on the health care sector thus shifting focus on valuing its intellectual capital (IC) and ensuring sustainable development. IC is critical for not only achieving a competitive advantage but also influencing sustainable development. The existing literature remains fragmented and underexposed with relation to IC and sustainable development in the health care sector. To address this issue, this study undertakes a systematic literature review of the IC and sustainable literature specific to the healthcare sector (n\\u2009=\\u200939). After analysing research articles indexed in Scopus, the findings highlight that publications in this area have been the highest over the last four years and around 50 per cent in the field of business, management, environmental sciences and social science combined. The extant literature has predominantly explored areas falling under three major themes, strategic approach, systems, and performance enhancement. The implications are for the academicians and practitioners to undertake future research agenda emphasizing IC contribution in the sustainable development of the health care sector.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Soundfair Australia Ltd collaborated with Swinburne University’s Living Lab to create person-centred care measures that are routinely tracked alongside other success measures in hearing rehabilitation. A Living Lab approach was applied. Living Lab projects at their heart apply co-design in real-life contexts involving multiple stakeholders to achieve innovative products and services for the people involved—in this project, patients as well as staff providing the hearing rehabilitation service. To ensure applied innovative design solutions remain focused on the goal and needs of the end-users it is important to measure their impact and revise and improve both the measures and solutions on a regular basis. To come to relevant conclusions, data needs to be collated and interpreted against the original goals over time. This project aimed to develop a dashboard—an artificial intelligence infrastructure—to bring together the data. Here we report on (i) the process to ensure the right patient data was collected and fed into the system to achieve meaningful measures and (ii) the barriers that we faced when collating and interpreting the measures of the dashboard in practice. We suggest the barriers identified are common in the health sector. We advance the discussion of barriers as consideration points to improve and establish implementation of artificial intelligence in the health sector to improve person-centred care.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Nowadays, Healthcare services are dependent on Health Information Systems (HIS). The Healthcare recommendation system plays a vital role in healthcare services, work as an essential tool for decision-making tasks. Health recommendation systems improve technology accessibility and simultaneously reduce the overload of information. Although technological advancement inside the medical domain extends back years, there are still numerous difficulties to be resolved. There are various tools and recommendations for doctors in health recommendation systems (HRS). The HRS can be based on collaborative filtering, content filtering, and knowledge filtering based or may be based on hybrid filtering-based techniques. HRS is used to evaluate patient information to derive the quality of content and aid in disease diagnosis and prediction. Patients can take medicine recommendations with the help of HRS. The classification models have discussed the existing performance metrics and comparative analysis such as LSTM, Fuzzy-Logic, CNN, CNN-LSTM, etc. These classification models have improved the precised parameters as compared with the existing deep learning models. It is used to monitor the wellness and critical condition of the patients. This study is seen to be a useful starting point and the foundation for HRS literature evaluation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Digital health technologies have for number years now been expected to reduce the skyrocketing health related costs as well as the care burden on traditional healthcare systems. However, their adoption and scaling have consistently been unsatisfactory and sometimes, outright disappointing. Scholars have offered several valuable, insightful, and pertinent contributions to address the above challenge. However, these contributions are in most cases atomistic, transitory, non-spatial, and dispersed. The above state of affairs has left practitioners in limbo as to where and when to apply which insights to what type of digital health intervention and in which context. In this article, a new holistic and integrated theoretical framework, specifically focusing on remote patients’ health management tools and systems (RPMTSs) used to engage patients and potential patients at distance or away from healthcare facilities is proposed and introduced to address the above existing fragmentation and gaps. The new framework demonstrates how a clear and holistic understanding of “adoption” and “scaling” processes in the context of a given type and nature of digital health intervention along with an adaptive complex, processual and systems thinking approach can help confront the complexity of the healthcare apparatus while at the same time responding to its constantly evolving, dynamic nature with “agents” who may sometimes act irrationally or behave in unpredictable ways. In the process, a new framework is added to the knowledge base to guide and support the adoption and scaling of RPMTSs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'We live in a world of stories, within a multiplicity of multidimensional narratives. We look upon stories for example, inspiration, guidance, or assurance. It is through stories that we learn as they are a universal source of knowledge, insight, and awareness. In a world made of change and challenges, finding meaning in the apparently random, chaotic, and unpredictable day by day life is the permanent job of our brain, a processor of stories. The confrontation with cancer, as a form of chronic illness, is one of the most challenging events people may came across in life. In Patient-Centred Care, stories and storytelling are regarded as an important tool for practice. We believe that through resonance both can be a valuable resource in behavioural change towards health and contribute to patients’ coping and empowerment. Design can play a fundamental role in this process through Health Design Thinking and its principles. Human-Centred Design means the needs of oncological patients, families, caregivers, and medical staff could be correctly and precisely identified and/or anticipated, and a creative mindset assures they could be addressed through resourceful written and presented stories to carefully embroidery behaviour towards the desired engagement and transformation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Prognosis of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a structure from Structural Health Monitoring data is the ultimate level in the SHM hierarchy. Reliable prognostics are key to a Condition Based Maintenance paradigm for aerospace systems and structures. In the present work, we propose a methodology for RUL prognosis of generic aeronautical elements i.e. single stringered composite panels subjected to compression/compression fatigue. Strain measurements are utilized in this direction via FBG sensors bonded to the stiffener feet. The strain data collected during the fatigue life are processed and used for the RUL prognosis. In order to accomplish this task, it is essential to produce Health Indicators (HIs) out of raw strain that can properly capture the degradation process. To create such HIs a new pre/post-processing technique is employed and a variety of different HIs are developed. The quality of the HIs can enhance the performance of the prognostic algorithms, hence a fusion methodology is proposed using genetic algorithms. The resulted fused HI is used for the RUL estimation of the SSCPs. Gaussian processes and Hidden Semi Markov Models are employed for RUL prognosis and their performance is compared. Despite the complexity the raw data we demonstrate the feasibility of successful RUL prognostics in a SHM-data driven approach.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Recent years have seen a growth in the spread of digital technologies for self-tracking and personal informatics. Smartphones‚ in particular, stand out as being an ideal self-tracking technology that permits both active logging (via self-reports) and passive tracking of information (via phone logs and mobile sensors). In this chapter, we present the results of a literature review of smartphone-based personal informatics studies across three different disciplinary databases (computer science, psychology, and communication). In doing so, we propose a conceptual framework for organizing the smartphone-based personal informatics literature. Our framework situates self-tracking studies based on their substantive focus across two domains: (1) the measurement domain (whether the study uses subjective or objective data) and (2) the outcome of interest domain (whether the study aims to promote insight or change in physical and/or mental characteristics). We use this framework to identify and discuss research trends and gaps in the literature. For example, most research has been concentrated on tracking of objective measurements to change either physical or mental characteristics, while less research used subjective measures to study a physical outcome of interest. We conclude by pointing to promising future directions for research on self-tracking and personal informatics and emphasize the need for a greater appreciation of individual differences in future self-tracking research.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'With the increasing number of subway lines and subway workers, their occupational health risks should be paid attention to. As the workplace, operation content, operation time, operation frequency and operators of metro operation and maintenance posts are determined according to the actual needs, the type, concentration or intensity, number of people, time and frequency of occupational hazards factors exposed are uncertain, and the risk is in a gray state, so it is difficult to evaluate their occupational health risk by quantitative evaluation method. Therefore, this paper takes a maintenance operation of Xi’an subway as the research object. The occupational health risk AHP model of subway maintenance operation was established from four aspects, which were occupational hazard factors, environmental factors, human-computer interaction factors and management factors. The gray analysis method was used to evaluate its uncertain risk. The comprehensive risk assessment results of occupational health for subway maintenance workers is between low and low risk level, which shown that the grey AHP can be used in the occupational health risk assessment of subway maintenance workers.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The number of patients with cancer is increasing, resulting in complex disease patterns and multifaceted patient needs. Both the municipal health service and specialist health services face growing challenges. Oncology nursing students must be trained to see situations comprehensively, act when a patient’s situation worsens, and communicate effectively with the patient and the patient’s relatives. Much of this training will take place during the students’ practice studies, but these periods are short, and there are many aspects of nursing for students to focus on. Simulation offers one option for promoting learning in nursing education.

       "  'abstract': 'The occupational exposure to chemicals usually occurs in higher levels than for the general population, usually by inhalation and dermal absorption but inadvertent ingestion may also occur. Biomonitoring is a powerful tool to assess exposure at the individual level, thus providing additional and valuable information in comparison with air monitoring. The present review aimed to compile the biomonitoring studies performed in occupational settings in Portugal, to assess exposure to chemicals and discuss the further use of the results obtained. An extensive search was performed to identify scientific papers available in PubMed and Web of Science, reporting data of occupational studies performed in Portugal, which included biomonitoring as a tool to assess exposure to chemicals. From the twenty-five scientific papers available, it was possible to conclude that most of the biomonitoring studies developed in Portugal in the scope of occupational health aimed to characterize the exposure and to validate new biomarkers and matrices. The further use of biomonitoring data for regulatory risk assessment is scarce or absent. Therefore, several challenges are posed in this area of knowledge for the scientific community to increment the use of biomonitoring as a tool for exposure/risk assessment and risk management.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Big data (BD) in structural health monitoring for civil engineers has become possible because of recent advances in sensor networks, computing, information, and data acquisition systems technologies (SHM). The time-frequency analysis-based data-driven method provides good opportunities for implementing a strategy of long-term SHM for the bridge by using measured vibration signals. But there are limitations associated with complex and time-consuming feature extraction and decision-making procedures due to high-dimensional big data. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative strategy that integrates the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert transform (HT) for informative feature extraction for bridge condition assessment. The efficiency of the suggested method is evaluated using data pertinent to a cable-stayed bridge. The findings demonstrate that the proposed technique is effective and robust in extracting informative features for bridge assessments in cases highly characterized by big data without any concerns regarding the information loss about the structural state. It is concluded that the proposed technique can address the issues of identifying data anomalies that are reliable early warning signs for future bridge failure and produce interpretable signal analyses that can handle BD with numerous periodic components, nonlinear functions, and periodic mode amplitudes as well as the problems of identifying data anomalies that are trustworthy early warning indications for upcoming bridge failure.',\n",

Today, Internet connected things (ICT) are increasing at a rapid rate and connecting with devices to reduce load from human being. Irrespective of the sector, the IoT devices are everywhere taking care of everything from the agriculture sector to the sector of manufacturing. But, due to the global COVID 19 pandemic, the sector of health care demands the major use of IoT today. Due to the prevailing pandemic, healthcare professionals also choose to treat the patients virtually rather than treating them physically. IoT plays a major role here. But, most of the application providers or service providers or any other system involving IoT devices for generating and storing data may become a way of leak of information or stolen by a third party for black mailing or financial gain thus leading to privacy and security leak of the user.

       "  'abstract': 'Objective This chapter aims to review the available literature related to firefighters’ exposure to health-relevant pollutants during firefighting of vehicle fires. Background Despite the increased number of vehicle fires, few studies assessed the compounds emitted and their potential health risks to firefighting forces. Method A literature review based on PRISMA methodology was performed regarding the characterization of vehicle fire emissions and associated firefighters’ exposure to the pollutants released during fires. Results Available literature characterized emissions during training fire events and so far, only one study evaluated the emissions from an emergency fire event. Increased levels of particulate matter, mainly the fine/ultrafine fractions, carbon monoxide (3–4\\xa0ppm inside the passenger compartment), and total volatile organic compounds (1.5–722.4\\xa0ppm; 3.16–502.7\\xa0mg/m 3 ) were reported during vehicle fires. More specifically, benzene (0.38–60\\xa0mg/m 3 ), styrene (0.45–314\\xa0mg/m 3 ), methane (0.8–110.0\\xa0ppm), butanol (81.8–181.6\\xa0ppm), and naphthalene (0.170–1.200\\xa0mg/m 3 at the cabin compartment) were also present in fire emissions. Despite scarce, evidence highlighted the contribution of vehicle fire emissions to firefighters’ occupational exposure. Conclusion Further studies should be conducted to provide a more detailed characterization of vehicle fires emissions and associated firefighters’ exposure, thus moving the scientific knowledge forward in order to promote firefighters’ safety and health.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Introduction workers are regularly exposed to several potential hazards including occupational pollutants that may affect their health. Occupational biomonitoring surveys predominantly use the collection of blood and/or urine. Objectives This work provides a compilation of available biomonitoring studies including the collection of saliva in occupationally exposed individuals. Method Literature research was performed in different online databases and, after applying the inclusion criteria, a total of 23 studies were selected. Results Available evidence demonstrates the use of saliva to assess recent exposure to metals and heavy metals (e.g., 3.03–129.0\\xa0µg/L of lead, 0.14–59.7\\xa0µg/L of cadmium, and 2.0–11.1\\xa0µg/L of mercury), volatile organic compounds (8.5–28.2\\xa0µg/L of styrene, 7.09\\xa0µg/L of toluene, 0.530–3.30\\xa0µg/L of phenanthrene, 0.437–1.48\\xa0µg/L of fluorene, 0.05–1.45\\xa0µg/L of acenaphthylene, 0.210–1.10\\xa0µg/L of fluoranthene, 0.230–0.860\\xa0µg/L of pyrene, 0.270–0.430\\xa0µg/L of naphthalene, and 0.199–0.329\\xa0µg/L of anthracene), and pesticides (0.047–4130\\xa0µg/L of atrazine, diazinon, and ethion) in workers. Conclusion Saliva has the potential to be used in occupational biomonitoring surveys. However, future health surveillance studies should include the collection of saliva to better characterize workers’ recent exposure to occupational pollutants, explore its correlation with other biological fluids (e.g., serum, plasma, and urine), and improve occupational health risk assessment.',\n",

Verschillen tussen mensen kunnen leiden tot discriminatie en zijn een fundamentele oorzaak van grote ongelijkheden in zorg en welzijn. Als ergotherapeut is het een uitdaging om de verschillen te leren omarmen. Inclusief denken is een van je belangrijkste uitgangspunten. In een cultureel sensitieve beroepshouding zijn veiligheid, bescheidenheid en interculturele competenties nodig om passende ergotherapeutische interventies aan te bieden en occupational rights te bewaken. Hierbij is kennis nodig over intersectionaliteit en kennis ten aanzien van demografie, gezondheid en welzijn. Om daadwerkelijk inclusief te werken geef je mensen die beperkingen ervaren de kans om hun eigen perspectief uit te leggen.

       "  'abstract': 'Introduction Alcohol use disorder is a global problem and is associated with various physical, mental and social complications. Symptom network analysis can provide an unique insight into the complex interaction of the various factors as regards to their contribution to all the social and mental health-related issues and vice versa. Objective This study attempts to understand this relationship in patients with alcohol use disorders by using principles of social network. Methods Relevant information was collected from patients attending Drug Deaddiction Centre of Assam Medical College, Dibrugarh, by using a structured tool containing questions related to pattern of use of alcohol and social and mental complications attributable to alcohol. Results The analysis of data by Gephi software showed that regular drinking had high degree score of 19 for social complications. In addition, fights with family members and decreased work performance (weighted degree 19 and 17, respectively) emerged as prominent contributors to social difficulties apart from regularity of drinking in the study population. Harmonic centrality values reveal that frequency of drinking behaviour is more influential than other factors in causing social harms. The degree centrality for network related to alcohol use and mental health-related complications was highest for regularity of drinking followed by stress and depression. Conclusion Frequency of drinking, fights with family members and decreased work performance are prominent contributors to social difficulties while regular drinking is a factor that is even more important than stress or depression in affecting mental health of persons with a history of alcohol.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The World Health Organization defines psychosomatic medicine as “the study of biological, psychological and social variables in health and disease”. It is widespread across the globe, and it has a significant effect on the quality of life. Bioactive compounds exist in little quantities in foods and many medicinal and non-medicinal plants and show therapeutic potential by reducing oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory effects and various metabolic disorders. These compounds work in different ways; studies suggest that fruit and vegetable consumption can counteract the progression of numerous diseases because of the presence of bioactive molecules in these foods. Several studies have given a relationship between mental stress and somatic disorders which can lead to serious consequences. Standard treatment of psychosomatic disorder includes mostly psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions.

       "  'abstract': 'Background Firefighting encompasses several health risks caused by exposure to toxic chemicals and due to the highly physical- and psychological demanding activities. Biomonitoring, based on biomarkers of effect and exposure, has been increasingly used to characterize the health status of firefighters and promote occupationally safer environments. Objective This study aims to identify possible correlations between biomarkers of exposure and effect among firefighters. Method Scientific databases were used to retrieve all the published information until December 2021. Results A total of eleven studies was found to explore the application of both types of biomarkers (exposure and effect). Chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, metals and other woodsmoke components, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, and flame retardants were biomonitored in blood, and urine. Generally, there were associations between these chemicals and altered biological mechanisms in blood and in urine including oxidative stress, inflammation, DNA damage, metabolic syndrome and thyroid hormone levels. However, overall, these findings, alone, are not sufficient to establish causality. Nevertheless, they are important starting points to address this problem and to stimulate the development of future studies, especially follow-up cohorts, which can gather more information and better confirm these associations.',\n",

The PMSF allows academics to obtain a basic understanding and conduct additional future studies in the area of PMSs in hospitals. Regarding the results of this research, it has been determined that a more thorough approach to PMS in hospitals is required. This research is also useful in that it offers knowledge to decision-makers who are considering using a PMS.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This paper has as main objective to analyze the participation of young people in digital communities that provide them with medical information and emotional support. The digital communities of two influencers on Instagram were analyzed: Anahí De Cárdenas (Peru) and Belén Canalejo (Spain). The influencers were selected because they have publicly presented the breast cancer they suffered and used their networks to provide support to users through their treatment’s diffusion, in the case of Anahí, and positive messages about mental health, in the case of Belén. A qualitative analysis was used that allowed to collect information from their followers. An ethnographic study was carried out in which the in-depth interview technique was applied to 6 users who belong to said communities. Likewise, the content analysis technique was applied in 3 videos and 3 podcasts published by the influencers with a high interaction of the followers. The results showed that young people participation in digital health communities is sustained by clearly identifiable narratives in each influencer related to trust and support. Likewise, in the interactions it was evidenced that the disease sustains the empathy of the followers, even more so if the follower has or has had the disease. Finally, in the insights of the users, the promotion of values \\u200b\\u200bsuch as generosity and equality is evident, since they see themselves as peers and promote chains of support toward the influencer and among themselves. Illness as a reality or possibility eliminates any difference or situation of inequality. This article contributes to the line of research on digital communities and health, delving into the use of social networks such as Instagram in order to address issues that contribute to the development and well-being of people.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Twenty-first century has witnessed an exponential growth in the use of electrical and electronic equipments throughout the world. These e-products, once they are no longer useful, becomes e-waste, and hence gets added to one of the fastest growing waste streams in the world. They contain diverse toxic metals like Pb, Cd, Hg, hexavalent Cr, Ni, As, and Ba and when disposed though the informal recyclers cause pervasive damages to the health and environment. An in-depth discussion on toxicants and pollutants from e-waste produced by the informal sector is presented in this chapter. Though an outcry for eco-friendly e-waste management is rising around the world, the standards of existing protocols for e-waste management in most countries are significantly low due to the intricacies in the formation and implication of policies, lack of proper collection systems, infrastructure, and also low public awareness. The crisis forged by the by-products of informal e-waste disposal; the effects of toxic heavy metals, dioxin and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); and their intermediate compounds released during the open combustion of e-waste are explained in this chapter. This highlights the urgency to address the challenges, opportunities, and future prospects of e-waste management at an international level.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The chapter explores how healthist framings as strategies of legitimation of same-sex parenting, in which knowledge on children’s health and psychological adjustment has become a key battleground, can work at concealing class relations while reproducing them. The case of Italy, where economic inequalities are particularly dramatic for families with children, with widespread and growing child poverty, is particularly telling about the implications of invisibilizing class relations in debates and research on same-sex parenting. Connecting different strands of literature, the chapter argues that the processes of recognition of same-sex parenting needs instead to be understood as related to how current class dynamics are at play in the re-familization of care responsibilities, the therapeutic surveillance of parents and the lines of exclusion drawn by models of good parenting.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The need to evaluate the accumulation of heavy metals and the health safety of fishery resources is urgent in the rice area of the Far North Region of Cameroon, where modern agriculture has been undertaken for more than 50\\xa0years, without evaluation of their impact on the environment and human health. Thus, the bioaccumulation of cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) in the muscles, gills, and livers of three fish species ( Alestes baremoze , Clarias gariepinus, and Tilapia niloticus ) caught in rice-farms’ channels of Pouss (i.e., the Far North Region of Cameroon) were evaluated to estimate the impact of modern agriculture on human health. Their contents were measured using an atomic absorption spectrometer. Zn (35.56–180.73\\xa0mg/kg dry weight) where the concentration was the most, followed by Pb (0.00–18.00\\xa0mg/kg dry weight) and Cu (0.55–9.05\\xa0mg/kg dry weight). Cd was not detected. The concentration of Pb in Clarias gariepinus in fish was 60 times more than the concentration allowed by the World Health Organization. This study is an alert to inhabitants of Pouss who consume these fish because they are at risk of Pb toxicity, especially children—that is their danger ratio (DR) for Pb is greater than 1. Nevertheless, the DR of adults for Pb is almost equal to 1.',\n",

This is performed highlighting the links between functional limitations, predominant activities, and fire evacuation. This study makes use of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) by the World Health Organization with application to the activities performed during a fire evacuation scenario and how those can be affected by functional limitations. Quantitative and qualitative data concerning the egress of people with functional limitations are also discussed. The findings are presented making use of the engineering egress timeline commonly adopted in fire safety engineering applications and attempting to translate consolidated concepts of the research in the field of accessibility to the fire evacuation field. This chapter highlights that most researches on the evacuation of people with functional limitations have so far focused on addressing mobility limitations, particularly on the movement phase. Current knowledge gaps concern the impact of cognitive limitations, the ability to smell smoke, and how speech impairments can affect communication during an evacuation scenario.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'COVID-19 has been a major global challenge these days. The pandemic has changed human life, attitude, and behavior. This pandemic added a burden to people’s life and health. With the new variants of SARS-CoV-2, a lot of people are even scared of going to the health centers to get the COVID-19 evaluation in fear of contamination and contagious, which caused the surge in the symptoms at later stages. Data collected across various sources can play an important role in predicting and identifying of COVID-19 virus based on the models and the classifications of this data using the most sophisticated machine learning models. The concern here is accessing or transferring an individual’s data from their personal health devices which defers users’ privacy. In the recent past, there are a lot of research that has been done these days on how blockchain can help to securely track and transfer the data across trusted sources. Adding to this, federated learning also is helping on-device data usage without any critical data to be transferred to various external sources. The proposed study directs the stability of frequent health status with the help of wearable devices that capture health metrics like heart rate, blood oxygen levels, breathing rate, muscle activities, stress, emotions, movement patterns, sleep activity, precipitation, and mind/cognitive functions with the introduction of the data streams and models that can seamlessly transfer the data, with the assurance of data integrity, privacy, and control which is the scope of this paper. The usage of both the emerging technologies provides a value addition in terms of health data exchange with effective data distribution with decentralized privacy and computation. We have also introduced a consent-based personal health device registration mechanism on a blockchain consensus network with digital identity to allow and take back controls over who can access their data. We believe that this solution and the implementation would help everyone to predict the possible COVID-19 infections keeping data privacy at the most priority.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Population aging is the central demographic phenomenon of the century, with significant and growing implications to the economy and society. The existing understanding of population aging is based on traditional measures such as old-age dependency ratio and share of elderly population. These are based on a traditional perspective that considers fixed old-age thresholds, such as age 60 or 65. However, age-specific characteristics of population above 60 are different across space and time. Thus, traditional aging measures are not ideal for making cross-country comparisons and do not take into account the multiple dimensions of population aging and do not provide a holistic view of population aging. Several efforts have been made to develop new measures of population aging recently, which accounts for the changing characteristics of the elderly. These measures can be broadly divided into three: (i) adjusted dependency ratios, (ii) multidimensional aging measures, and (iii) measures that use recalculated old-age thresholds. While these measures come up with several unique advantages and benefits, they have their share of drawbacks as well. These measures try to account for the changing characteristics of elderly populations, but they are not simultaneously multidimensional and comparable across different regions. Moreover, most of these recently developed measures of population aging come from developed countries and are thus based on the ideals of well-being among the elderly in the Western world. This chapter provides a critical overview of the existing measures of population aging and throws light on novel measures of population aging that can be comparable across demographically diverse countries.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Moral challenges have clear impacts on physician well-being. The concept of moral injury emerged from work with combat veterans. Existing diagnostic categories did not adequately capture the psychological challenges and distress seen in soldiers returning from war. The concept of moral injury was later applied to augment the understanding of physician distress, with the aim of considering varying etiologies of the symptoms of distress seen in healthcare workers. Healthcare worker moral injury occurs when physicians are repeatedly asked to participate in or witness acts which are not in accordance with their personal moral compass. System changes which acknowledge these distinct drivers of physician distress will be needed to improve physician well-being and enhance individual self-resilience.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this chapter, we explore the role that values alignment plays in shaping the well-being of pediatricians. We begin by defining what values alignment is, as well as linking it to self-determination theory and authenticity in professional practice. We then identify three key areas in which values alignment can pose a challenge. At the micro, individual level, values alignment can become a point of contention in personal interactions of pediatricians with their patients and their families, or while navigating challenges pertaining to work-life balance. At the meso, institutional level, values alignment can be threatened by administrative pressures and dissonance between personal and organizational values. Finally, macro, structural level challenges to values alignment stem from policies and the cultural contexts that pediatricians work within. Our overall goal in this chapter is to demonstrate that while values alignment is primarily experienced at the personal level, it is largely shaped by organizational and socio-cultural factors that extend far beyond pediatricians’ control. We also provide recommendations on how values alignment can be facilitated to promote well-being among pediatricians.',\n",

If gender disparities are the outcome of widely differing work situations for women and men they are also influenced by the unequal distribution of domestic work and the tasks of caring both for older and younger generations. Men and women’s working life courses and trajectories are embedded in institutionalized pathways and normative patterns. They participate in the world of work with specific position and defined social role. The chapter shows how working trajectories impact on health among the over-50s, and changing workforce exit norms. Finally, it points out the need to take account of gender-differential career and non-career paths and to redress the inequalities and injustices in this area. The analytical framework of this chapter relies on the concept of sustainable work considered from a life span perspective.

       "  'abstract': 'The Green building (GB) concept has been widely adopted by practitioners from the building and construction industry in the last few decades as an effort to reduce the negative environment al impacts caused by the development of the built environment. GB concept emphasizes resource usage efficiency, which focuses on conserving the natural resources to preserve the climate and environment through innovations in building design, construction methods, and materials. Awareness and surge of attention to the healthy building (HB) concept, which focuses on the quality of life and well-being in buildings, has increased lately due to the pandemic. However, minimal evidence was found regarding the implementation of healthy buildings. Therefore, this study aims to identify the building variables and elements that construct the HB concept and determine its differences from GB. Archive analysis and comparative study were performed to obtain this objective, taking into account the GB guideline practiced in Indonesia and several HB parameters derived from the literature. The results of this study indicated that there are elements that overlap, particularly in the indoor environmental quality factor, but there are fundamental differences between the two concepts.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Financial hardship is increasingly understood as a serious threat to achieving cancer health equity. Food insecurity, defined as an inability to access enough healthy food because of a lack of money or other resources, is an extreme manifestation of financial hardship that occurs when patients shift money from their food budget to cover other expenses, including cancer treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that cancer-related financial hardship disproportionately impacts Latinos; however, the research on financial hardship, food insecurity, and access to medical care is limited. Results are presented from a cross-sectional survey comparing the prevalence of financial hardship and food insecurity among population-based Hispanic and non-Hispanic cancer survivors, and the relationship between ethnicity, food insecurity, and forgone medical care is examined. The substantially higher prevalence of food insecurity among Hispanic cancer survivors highlights the need for food insecurity screening and prevention programs in community oncology practice.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Functional foods are those wholesome, fortified, and enriched foods which help to provide better health conditions beyond the optimum levels of vital micronutrients (e.g. vitamins and minerals), when such food is taken at efficient amounts as part of a varied diet on a consistent basis. They are formulated by manipulating the preparations or engineered genetically or by other conventional means to provide the desired function. If functional food is recommended to children, its safety and efficacy must be established. The gut microbiota is implicated in gastrointestinal health, nutrient metabolism, and benefits such as prevention of infection. Dietary fibre, including prebiotics, escapes digestion in the small intestine and reaches the colon intact, where they are partially or completely fermented by the gut microbiota. Breastfeeding is the good example for useful nutrition during the first year of life. Probiotics health-promoting bacteria added to infant formula is one of the successful ways in the preventive measure and treatment of diarrhoea. Prebiotics promote growth of gut health by adding in infant formula which are helpful in lowering the frequent occurrence of high temperature, cold, and severity of diarrhoea. When prebiotics are consumed before, during, and after measles, vaccination helps in lowering the incidence of infection.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of the Islamic waqf system in the contemporary Islamic societies and the significance of applying institutionalized systems for efficient administration and governance of waqf institutions. The study has been classified into theoretical and practical aspects. The theoretical aspect treats the concept of waqf, its classifications, the institutional development of the beneficiaries of contemporary waqf, and the legal and Shariah frameworks governing them. It highlights the major emerging and new waqf beneficiaries in the fields of education, health and relief. On the other hand, the practical aspect conducts a field study of waqf institutions. The study adopted both the inductive method and the descriptive approach employing the face-to-face interview method for collecting data as well as telephone interviews with interviewees. A number of conclusions emerged from the research, including a keen interest in waqf work and management practises, as well as an emphasis on the supervisory function. In addition, the concept of legislative stalemate was proposed. The study also discovered that current legislation and the renewal of jurisprudence provided waqf banks, as well as the general public, the freedom to develop successful new and creative banks to support their work.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Structural health monitoring (SHM), together with condition monitoring (CM), nondestructive evaluation (NDE), statistical process control (SPC), and damage prognosis (DP), through the most recent techniques of survey and data processing, allows to identify, evaluate, and monitor with ever-greater clarity the structural characteristics and the level of damage of any building and, therefore, to predict its trend over time. The use of traditional and experimental sensor networks and the processing of the data obtained from them allow to identify anomalies in the behavior of structures in operation, as well as to implement early warning systems. The use of accelerometric sensors is helpful for identifying the representative parameters of the structural behavior; the measurements of the displacements, on the other hand, allow a quick estimate of the magnitude strictly correlated to any damage suffered by the structure during a seismic event or a failure. In this work we try to reach the last three steps of the hierarchical structures proposed by Ritter, which are remembered to be damage location, damage assessment, and prediction. To obtain these levels, it is necessary to combine all the analyzes of the simple SHM that leads to the sending of an alarm, to a cognitive capacity of the building, also achieved with the use of artificial intelligence. In particular, the connection of SHM with AI and with building information modeling (BIM) can make the system cognitive, making it capable of managing (e.g., ensure, predict, assess) the healthiness of a building. The article also presents a case study to highlight how the proposed methodology is applicable to concrete cases.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'There has been a massive surge in mental health cases around the world post COVID-19 pandemic, which can be defined as an urgent and dangerous world health threat. According to pre-COVID-19 estimates, depression and anxiety alone have cost the economy over US $1\\xa0trillion each year. Every dollar spent on evidence-based care for depression and anxiety results in a return of $5 as per the research conducted by WHO (Arnrich et al. in Methods Inf Med 49:67–73, 2010 [ 1 ]). Moreover, when a person is sick, they visit the doctor to perform some tests to determine a medical diagnosis. But when it comes to mental health, there is no test to determine the diagnoses, which makes mental health diagnosis challenging. The paper proposes on-device IoT framework to aid in the identification, assessment, treatment, and potentially alleviation of symptoms associated with mental health disorders. To determine and investigate the effectiveness of the proposed system used in the paper for diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, and mental health enhancement, we will be using the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 5 (DSM 5) (WHO in Depression and other common mental disorders: global health estimates. Geneva, 2017 [ 2 ]), an authoritative reference used for defining and categorizing mental health disorders. The proposed system will leverage the on-devices ML capabilities to identify the symptoms from raw heterogeneous sensor data like apple watch, Raspbian, textile t-shirts, smart mirrors, mobile phones, etc. And use HERE SDK to identify the person travel patterns. The proposed system includes features like emotional intelligent IoT, data privacy, model adaptability.',\n",

Patients are increasingly using the social network, particularly pharmaceutical social networking sites, to obtain health-related information. Viewpoints are disclosed in this article. This is a vital topic as differences in perception can lead to further disputes between patients and doctors. The survey includes 1500 patients and 400 doctors. The results show that there are significant differences in the perspective of doctors and patients. Because patients and doctors work together as a team, and patients are available to doctors for healthcare solutions, such large differences in their views on the pros of SMP can cause the partnership to fail.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Digital transformation is a concept that defines the process of finding solutions to social and sectoral needs with the integration of digital technologies, and accordingly the development and change of workflows and culture. Digital transformation includes many concepts such as virtual reality, augmented reality, drones, 3D printing, cloud, big data, internet of things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI). Digital transformation, which is developing at an increasing pace today, has affected many sectors and forced them to adapt to digital transformation developments in order to maintain their existence and competitive advantages. While digital transformation has provided numerous advantages to the industries, it has also caused some implementation difficulties and risks. In this chapter, the current situation of digital transformation is discussed one by one on the basis of sectors such as automotive, energy, smart manufacturing, white goods, health, banking, tourism, insurance, digital education, smart cities, and transportation. The trends that await these sectors in the future are examined and finally, future-oriented digital transformation expectations are given.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Aims/hypothesis Type 2 diabetes is one of the leading causes of death globally and its incidence has increased dramatically over the last two decades. Recent research suggests that loneliness is a possible risk factor for type 2 diabetes. This 20 year follow-up study examined whether loneliness is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. As both loneliness and type 2 diabetes have been linked to depression and sleep problems, we also investigated whether any association between loneliness and type 2 diabetes is mediated by symptoms of depression and insomnia. Methods We used data from the Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT study), a large longitudinal health study based on a population from central Norway ( n =24,024). Self-reports of loneliness (HUNT2 survey, 1995–1997) and data on HbA 1c levels (HUNT4 survey, 2017–2019) were analysed to evaluate the associations between loneliness and incidence of type 2 diabetes. Associations were reported as ORs with 95% CIs, adjusted for sex, age and education. We further investigated the role of depression and insomnia as potential mediating factors. Results During the 20 year follow-up period, 4.9% of the study participants developed type 2 diabetes. Various degrees of feeling lonely were reported by 12.6% of the participants. Individuals who felt most lonely had a twofold higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes relative to those who did not feel lonely (adjusted OR 2.19 [95% CI 1.16, 4.15]). The effect of loneliness on type 2 diabetes was weakly mediated by one subtype of insomnia but not by symptoms of depression. Conclusions/interpretation This study suggests that loneliness may be one factor that increases the risk of type 2 diabetes; however, there is no strong support that the effect of loneliness on type 2 diabetes is mediated by depression or insomnia. We recommend that loneliness should be included in clinical guidelines on consultations and interventions related to type 2 diabetes. Graphical abstract ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Social work as a profession is widely known within the United Kingdom, particularly in relation to children’s welfare and safeguarding. There is significantly less visibility with the social work role in the military. Military social workers are either uniformed serving personnel, civilians employed directly by the Ministry of Defence or in a contracted role to deliver social work services. Military social workers work in health and welfare services, supporting serving personnel, and depending on their role/remit, with families too. The Ministry of Defence is a large organisation with the separate services of the military (Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force (RAF)) each having their own structure and processes. This chapter will give a broad overview of military social work (MilSW) within the different teams and services. It will explore the roots of social work in the military, education/training requirements to practice and settings in which practitioners are based. Attention will be given to the social work role in terms of interventions, approach, work with veterans and consideration for the ethics and challenges of working in a military context.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Among the various environmental factors that influence human health and psychophysical condition, the weather and climate play an important role. Aggressive behavior can be the result of widely understood meteorological factors, such as temperature or atmospheric pressure. This is especially true for people with a high nervous system sensitivity, such as those with mental illnesses. Difficult behaviors might result in conflicts and, in the case of a psychiatric ward, an increased risk of coercive measures being employed. In turn, this might have a negative impact on the treatment process itself and therefore the quality of healthcare. The most frequently mentioned meteorological risk factors for aggressive and auto-aggressive behavior are air temperature and humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed. The seasonality of the impact of the weather (specific months or seasons) is also important. The weather can also synergistically affect the human body through the influence of different weather elements at the same time. However, meteorological factors should not be considered as the sole variable that causes aggressive behavior, for they affect both staff and patients. Therefore, they should be considered as one of the groups of elements that influence aggressive behavior.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Nowadays in this 21st century, youth is mainly leaning on chatting forums instead of real-life conversations trying to convey their emotions to their close friends with the help of texts, emojis, etc. On the contrary, the receiver may find it difficult to understand the emotions due to mistyped texts, misunderstandings, or any other issues. Henceforth, this bafflement may lead to more depression, and anxiety and may lead to serious threats to life like suicides. Among all the reasons, almost one-half of the people attempt suicide due to depression, anxiety is the main reason as other people cannot understand them. To overcome this problem of the understanding mood of the people and motivating them, the proposed model can be one of the best applications which can help the depressed user to overcome his/her stress, anxiety, etc. with the help of motivational quotes. The proposed model is a chat-based forum that is designed to monitor the mental health of the user the model consists of two parts: (i) Web Development; (ii) Machine Learning. This application is built with a Machine Learning algorithm and integrated with web development. Web scraping and creation of datasets have been done with the help of ‘Tweet’ and ‘Pandas’. ML model is trained using ‘ScikitLearn’. Further, the Machine Learning model is integrated with the chat-based Forum web application with the help of ‘Flask’.',\n",

The review and analysis of the literature reveals that these people are widely subjected to discrimination and violence in all areas of their lives.

Moreover, the analysis of this discrimination and violence from a queer perspective highlights that these phenomena must be comprehended as being more than exclusively individual, conscious, and voluntaristic acts, setting them in the framework of social discourses about normal and abnormal identities.

       "  'abstract': 'Functional foods are a class of bioactive compounds that have proven benefits on the human health, especially the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. The foods having these benefits are components of our daily diets. Functions foods have the capability of lowering the blood lipid levels, reducing the low-density lipoproteins, prevention plaque deposition and also platelet aggregation. Nutrition composition of the foods matters because of their phytoprotective substances and bioactive compounds which reduce the cardiovascular risk. The functional foods such as flavonoids, phytochemicals and antioxidants present in plant and animal sources act as cardio-protective agents. The legumes, peas and lentils are rich in iron, antioxidants and healthy proteins which are helpful in maintaining heart health and reducing the blood levels of atherosclerotic LDL cholesterol. The interaction of functional food bioactive compounds such as phenolic acids, hydroxybenzoic acids, omega-3 fatty acids and PUFA is linked to prevention of degeneration of heart muscles and arteries. One of the animal sources that rich in functional foods is the Fish. It has Omega-3 fatty acids and the intake of fish twice a day strengthens the heart muscles. As concluded in many researches, the fish is a functional food source that has high levels of good fats and high proteins which are recommended for heart. Therefore, this area has many science-based evidences which would be elaborated to enlighten the subject further.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Social determinants of health (SDoH) are non-medical factors that influence the health outcomes, and it is the need of the hour to find its effect in healthcare subsystems such as the home healthcare services, driving the emerging initiatives to address them. However, challenge lies in associating SDoH factors to the healthcare data and deriving its effect on the health outcomes. In this work, home healthcare service data is systematically studied and the correlation of SDoH factors in the utilization of home healthcare services is proved. The home healthcare services utilization model is modelled to use service attributes along with the enrollee’s SDoH factors contributing to the increase of 3% accuracy. The learning approach to obtain the utilization classes adopts the concept of cliques from the subset of input features which forms the baseline for the home healthcare service utilization model. The home healthcare service utilization model is a tree ensemble model, XGBoost, a classifier with regularization, achieving the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric of 0.98. Furthermore, the work shows the correlation between home healthcare service utilization with temporal factors.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The technological innovation in the healthcare sector has contributed to the growth of telemedicine in India. “Health services” fall under State responsibility as per the Indian Constitution by virtue of Schedule 7—although policy and planning framework are under the scope of Central government. Telemedicine cannot not work as an autonomous service, rather, ought to be subjected to different regulations having complex ethical, medico-legal manifestations. As far as India is concerned, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India (MoHFW) is the body responsible for initiating the policy of digitization of healthcare. However the point is—how far digital health services going appropriately in India. Based on NDHB’s comprehensive architectural framework of “Federated National Health Information System” in January 2020 and as the pandemic strategy Medical Council of India and the NITI Aayog released new guidelines on telemedicine with respect to registered medical practitioners, this research needed to be checked. Thus, the examination was done in these aspects. Guidelines were revisited to see how the hospitals in Delhi and NOIDA function based on the records submitted in medical consultation given to patients using telemedicine. It is felt that telemedicine being a nebulous concept in India, it needs to be analyzed in the light of prospective opportunities it would offer. There is a need for collaborative approaches on digital health, revision in the prevailing legal and ethical frameworks, the clinical practices corresponding to standing medical guidelines. Also, it is found that there exist no uniform telemedicine practices balancing the privacy norms, medico-legal responsibility and regulatory standards. To arrive at conclusion, the best practices prevailed in other countries are examined and adopted. It is felt that the policies existing in telemedicine need to be bifurcated as digital consultation, digital photography, remote patient monitoring (RPM) separately.',\n",

In this study, a literature review about the application of the Resilience Assessment Grid (RAG) in different sectors in the last decade is performed. The information was selected from the following databases: Scopus, Wos, ScienceDirect and PubMed, guided by the PRISMA methodology using search criteria by title, abstract and keywords. The most used basic tool is the RAG, which applied individually or in combination helps to understand the behaviour of these complex socio-technical systems (CSS) under the perspective of safety management. The tools used in the last decade in RE studies with the RAG in different sectors are presented chronologically. Safety-II could be considered as a suitable management system at present, where the RE helps to measure resilient performance potential in the CSS, but not resilience per se, using the RAG individually or in combination, with the basic number of questions or structured in a customised way.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"In the current scenario, e-waste is a growing concern for every nation in the world; because every year, its production gives a shocking outcome. Here, we have taken an attempt to determine the link between business opportunities and recycling of e-waste by applying microbial activities. To build such a research hypothesis, the advances in the biotechnology-driven recycling process for metal extraction from e-waste have been analyzed in brief. E-waste contains metals, toxic substances, plastic, and halogenated compounds in it. The toxicity of e-waste is unsatisfactory; because it pollutes soil, water, and air by releasing different toxic compounds. Not only human beings it also affects plants and animals adversely in the landfills areas. To tackle a huge amount of e-waste, every country follows some regulating approaches. But, its management is a serious issue owing to informal recycling activities, lack of infrastructure, lack of awareness, and sensitization to handle different types of e-waste's components in developing countries. Proper management can reduce e-waste and develop a sustainable environment. Besides this, e-waste can boost a country's economy if proper management is going on; as it contains valuable materials; recovering such materials can help to earn money, creates job, and also reduce raw materials. So, it is serious as well as beneficial for a country.\",\n",

Objective: to assess the prevalence of burnout in physiotherapists during the pandemic COVID-19. Methodology: a computerized search of articles published between December 2019 and July 30, 2021, in the PubMed, Academic Search Complete, MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, and Web of Science databases and in the Google Scholar search engine was conducted to identify studies of burnout in physiotherapists during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: 4 studies were included in this review, involving 684 physiotherapists. The studies analysed the number of participants, the characteristics of the sample, the assessment tool, intervention domain, and main outcomes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, physiotherapists exhibited moderate to high rates of burnout symptoms. Conclusion: results suggest that burnout symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic are prominent among physiotherapists working directly with patients. The current results show moderate to high burnout symptom rates, which have increased compared to data published prior to the pandemic.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This article starts from the theory of computer vision in bridge health monitoring summarizes how it has been used in bridges by applying data collection, data analysis, and data management of bridge health monitoring systems. All these technologies can be used adeptly in their aspects. In the past, China used manual detection of bridge cracks, relying on large mechanical devices such as bridge trucks to send people under the bridge to monitor the health of the bridge. This method was time-consuming and labor-intensive, and the safety of manual labor could not be guaranteed. It is easy to cause diagnostic errors [ 1 ]. This research introduces the general situation and summarizes the main problems in this field of computer vision.',\n",

In situating the As problem in a broader science, concepts related to As chemistry, As pollution, As mobilization, and As toxicity are discussed. Relying on empirical data from mine sites and nearby communities in southwestern Ghana and crucial scholarship and scientific literature, we report high concentration of As in six media comprising soil (tailings, farms, and mining sites), water (surface and groundwater), water sediments (rivers and streams), food (meat and fish), plants (vegetation and food crops/fruits), and human (urine and blood samples). Soil, water, and urine are the top three media that report the highest and most siginificant concentration of As with levels exceeding established recommended threshold limits. Additionally, we identify and discuss the gaps in As research in Ghana and provide recommendations on sustainable strategies for cleaning contaminated sites.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Wildfires, and their associated management activities, can have complex social, economic, and environmental impacts. This chapter highlights some of the key impacts of wildfires in six sections. The first section about community focuses on relationships between recent destructive wildfires around the globe and losses to life and property. It also presents the main mechanisms of house loss in the Wildland-Urban Interface. Following that, a section about biodiversity impacts describes the major effects of wildfires and associated fire regimes on plants and animals, underlining both negative and positive effects. Then, the focus shifts to soil and water with a section that highlights how wildfires can have serious implications for downstream water quality and yield, posing a threat to water security for the people and aquatic wildlife. This is followed by a section about air quality, which describes the effect of wildfires on visibility, human health and their contribution to climate change. The next section highlights the role of dynamic fire behaviours that lead to the most severe impacts, describing the fire behaviours themselves and their frequency of occurrence. The chapter closes with a case study describing the extreme impacts of the 2019/2020 fire season in south-eastern Australia on people and the environment.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The soil carbon (C) stock is comprised of the soil inorganic carbon (SIC) and the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock. A site-specific steady state equilibrium soil C stock evolves under natural conditions depending on the balance between soil C inputs (plant residues) and losses (decomposition, erosion, leaching). The SIC stock is perceived as being less dynamic than the SOC stock with uncertain effects of organic agriculture (OA) on SIC sequestration rate, and not the focus of agricultural soil and land-use management. In contrast, the SOC stock receives increasing attention due to its importance for the global climate and soil health. However, increases in the SOC stock may also alter the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance and this must be addressed in the assessment of soil C sequestration practices to mitigate climate change. The historical loss of SOC due to the conversion of natural ecosystems to agroecosystems provides an opportunity to use soil and land-use management practices to partially replenish lost SOC stocks. Topsoil (0–15 cm depth) SOC stocks have been shown to increase under OA management by 1.98–3.50 Mg C ha −1 compared to nonorganic management. But the addition of exogenous C (e.g., with manure) for this improvement and SOC sequestration for climate change adaptation and mitigation may be important. Compared to nonorganic management, topsoil SOC sequestration rates did either not differ or were 0.29–0.45 Mg C ha −1 \\xa0year −1 higher under OA, respectively. However, assessments of SOC sequestration and stocks for the entire rooted soil profile are scanty but needed to fully address long-term effects of agricultural management on SOC. Lower primary soil C inputs due to lower OA yields and higher losses by tillage compared to conventional no-tillage (NT) system may result in lower steady state equilibrium SOC stocks in OA systems. There is some evidence that root C allocation is higher under OA than that under nonorganic management. More agricultural soils will be managed in the future by OA driven by increasing consumer demand. The net effects of increased soil and land-use management for OA on the global soil C stocks must be critically assessed also in relation to long-term field experiments to support the design of climate-smart and climate resilient agroecosystems. Therefore, the objectives of this chapter are to describe in detail what processes and practices result in changes in SIC and SOC stocks and sequestration in soils under OA management.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Irish government responses to Covid-19 initially cleaved closely to the advice of public health officials. The government was influenced by the dynamic problem pressures exerted by Covid-19, but it was also influenced by the pressure of economic and social problems and by other, political considerations, not least in December 2020 when it diverged from public health advice and relaxed containment measures, a move that had significant consequences for Covid-19 infections and deaths. This chapter shows that key features of Ireland’s pre-Covid governance and politics were reproduced in the first 15\\xa0months of its Covid-19 response, including its executive-heavy political system, its convergent party politics, and its non-politicised civil service. However, the pandemic also brought other features to the fore, including open conflict between the government and civil servants, and intense bureaucratic politics.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Arsenic (As) is a highly toxic and non-essential element for all forms of life. Inorganic forms of As, arsenite and arsenate, are more toxic and mobile than the organic ones. Both geogenic and anthropogenic sources led to contamination of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems with variable As concentrations in over 115 countries worldwide, posing health risk to\\u2009~\\u2009250 million people. The pathways of As exposure to humans include drinking well water, irrigation water, food crops, exports and imports of food products (e.g., rice grain, baby food items). This chapter elaborates global As contamination issue in context of various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. Hence it is crucial to address global As hazard to ensure water and food security, human health, SDGs, as well as improve the socio-economic situation of the communities in As-affected areas. The current chapter introduces key features of this book with twenty four chapters covering As contamination, ecotoxicology, remediation, risk assessment, environmental modeling of As etc. The introductory chapter also summarizes and provides key information about this book, which will be useful to successfully address global As problem for sustainable As mitigation on a global scale by 2030.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Air pollution induces a variety of human ailments, including respiratory, circulatory, neurological, digestive, and urinary organ problems, as well as cancer. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been primary air pollutants in indoor and urban environments, adverse to human health and the environment. The air purifier was developed to reduce indoor airborne pollutants, including particles. The discussion includes properties of air purified, photocatalytic properties on different airborne contaminants, the effect of greenhouse gases (CO x , NO x , SO x ) on the air purifier, classifying the effect of photocatalyst materials on ground level smoke, ozone, smogs, viruses, and bacteria. Research on air filters to overcome the Covid 19 virus outbreak is increasingly popular. Current possible materials and performance for photocatalytic air purifiers using bismuth (Bi), WO 3 , silver (Ag), C 3 N 4 , and oxide materials. Some materials with different variations are found with the best product and removal efficiency results. The discussion is to elucidate the possible material for an air filter (air purifier). In addition, HEPA Filter with an excellent filter for dealing with mold, dust, germs, viruses, and other gases in indoor and outdoor systems is also discussed. These filters are made up of multiple layers of filter material and can eliminate at least 99.97% of particles larger than 3 microns. Finally, TiO 2 as a famous photocatalytic material is also discussed as a filter precursor in several investigations which is ideal for germs, smoke, and smells.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The support that radiological examinations provide for medical diagnosis is essential. Over time, an increase in the performance of these exams has been observed and, consequently, an increase in people exposed to X-rays. For biological reasons, women are most sensitive to X-rays. It becomes important to analyse their health literacy levels, safeguarding radiological protection in the future. An online questionnaire was developed, and disseminated on the digital platforms of three associations, aimed at women aged between 18 and 57. A sample of 502 women was obtained. It was possible to observe gaps in health literacy, namely in dose, as well as in the X-rays presence in some exams, such as “Mammography” and “Bone Density”. Variables such as “Age” and “Academic Qualification” are shown to directly influence the literacy levels presented. On the other hand, the information provided by the Healthcare Professionals did not reveal to exert any influence on the levels of women’s radiological knowledge. Betting on greater and better communication in radiology for this target audience, considering the sociodemographic variables of each one, will promote greater interest and participation of Health Users in the process, helping to increase radiological protection and safety.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Understanding burnout and its effects on employees’ performance and wellbeing has been studied since the 1980s. Monitoring burnout syndrome among health care professionals, such as physicians and nurses, is a critical task. On the one hand, medical staff has to be good at controlling their own emotions in confronting the health care challenges; on the other hand, they share similar emotional exhaustion, frustration, and feelings with their own patients. This can lead to medical diagnosis errors, weak performance, and lower quality of treatments. The main purpose of this study is to provide a concise literature review of research works on burnout syndrome among medical staff, including research methods, assessments, solutions, and best practices. No matter their field of expertise and responsibilities, burnout is a considerable common psychological syndrome among medical staff, ranging from 40 to 66%. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) has been the most widely used questionnaire for data collection in the literature. Factors such as age, gender, marital status, and working conditions are identified as the most contributive parameters in the severity of burnout. Furthermore, studies have found that the degree of burnout can be reduced by under-taking self-improvement techniques such as meditation, development of communication skills, peer coaching, and doing art therapy. A considerable number of medical personnel are vulnerable to burnout syndrome in various degrees and forms. This common phenomenon threatens patients’ health and lives due to a reduction in medical care quality. This review covers the best practices for protecting and overcoming the hardnesses and challenges ahead of many health care professionals in their careers.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand. —Confucius 551–479\\xa0BCE Simulation is increasingly used in nursing education to supplement clinical and didactic learning activities. Simulation is a technique for practice and learning that can be used in many different disciplines as well as for trainees. Simulation is a technique (not a technology) aiming at replacing real experiences with guided ones; that is, it represents a context in which students can exercise and explore various aspects of a specific practical skill. Accordingly, simulation-based learning signifies a useful approach to develop health professionals’ knowledge, skills, and attitudes while protecting patients from unnecessary risks. Simulation involves learning situations that take place under the supervision of an expert or lecturer and is commonly applied as an active learning method in different health disciplines like nursing, social education, radiography, and medicine. This chapter concentrates on historical and pedagogical perspectives of simulation as a learning method in nursing education. Simulation as a learning method builds on pedagogical adult learning theory, with an emphasis on David A. Kolb and Donald Schön’s concepts experience-based learning , reflection-on-action , and reflection-in-action . Simulation-based learning is appropriate for topics such as patient safety, teamwork, and quality of health services. The literature states that simulation contributes positively to nursing students’ situational awareness, their ability to formulate and predict possible consequences of action implemented, decision-making, communication, and teamwork.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Healthcare industry is going through unprecedented changes during recent times. Outburst of Pandemic in 2019 has suddenly increased people’s attention on preventive healthcare system. Requirement for regular health checkups, immunity boosting food, and exercise and fitness industry has boomed like never before. Process management path can provide a solution to lot of these healthcare sector requirements. By and large, the healthcare industry had been a late entrant in process management path. There are outliers, but the majority of people would agree that platforms and processes were not adopted as quickly as they were in other industries. This is due to a number of factors. A splintered and convoluted supply chain, with patients, payers, and providers all working toward their own goals. From an end-to-end perspective, there has been no collaboration and no ownership of the outcome due to the first point. In many circumstances, the buyer is the government or the employer, adding another layer of complexity to an already complex business environment. However, it is a known fact that BPM practices adapted to health care have shown enormous benefits. Some researchers, however, claimed in 2019 that BPM industry is dead. However, the outburst or Coronavirus led to a disruption in the industry which is now on revival path. The present paper aims at analyzing the growth, decline, and recovery stage of healthcare BPM and role of digitization in transformation of the business.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Groundwater arsenic contamination has been a staggering issue for the last 45\\xa0years. When the contaminated water is used for irrigational activities, the problem aggravates. Bengal delta is mainly reliant on rice as the staple diet and its cultivation often requires irrigation water during summer due to scarcity of fresh water and insufficient rainfall. Therefore, in arsenic exposed area, the use of contaminated groundwater can introduce arsenic into the soil–plant system. Astonishingly, rice grain accumulates up to 10 times more arsenic than other regularly harvested crops and its accumulation differs with geographical location, rice variety, cultivars and cultivation season. Importantly, arsenic concentration of paddy is highly dependent on the primordial arsenic concentration in irrigation water and soil. Geographical attributes of an area are the most significant factors of arsenic content in rice grains, as they are the chief influencer of soil arsenic concentration. In this study, the contamination quotient of rice grain arsenic is determined by the average values from four sampling sites namely North 24-Parganas, Nadia, Kolkata and West Medinipur districts of West Bengal, India and the values are 300, 215, 190, and 137\\xa0µg/kg, respectively. Apart from geographical origin, rice grain arsenic concentration also differs with cultivar. So here, rice grains are classified into three different categories according to their arsenic accumulation and assimilation capacity. The maximum amount of rice cultivars in the entire study area are medium accumulators; range of arsenic concentration is\\u2009>\\u2009100–300\\xa0µg/kg (n\\u2009=\\u200945) with an average value of 178\\u2009±\\u200941\\xa0µg/kg. Simultaneously, arsenic concentration of rice grain depends on various factors; however, variety is one of the key players. Parboiling with arsenic contaminated water act as a “factor enhancer” during this process in arsenic exposed area. Our study found that sunned rice grains contain lower arsenic (188\\xa0μg/kg) compared to the parboiled one (268\\xa0μg/kg). Concurrently, the fourth factor is cultivation season. In Bengal delta, paddy cultivation is practiced in two seasons: pre-monsoonal and monsoonal season. The data depicts that monsoonal grain contains lesser amount (224\\u2009±\\u200963\\xa0µg/kg) of arsenic than pre-monsoonal (528\\u2009±\\u2009434\\xa0µg/kg) grain. This can be interpreted by the theory of dilution, because in monsoon season, rainwater mixes with the waterlogged irrigation field and dilutes the initial arsenic concentration. Transport of arsenic-contaminated rice grain grown in arsenic endemic areas to the non-endemic sites and consequent dietary intakes leads to great threats for the local inhabitants.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The coronavirus, one of the deadliest virus erupted in Wuhan, China in December and has claimed millions of lives worldwide and infected too. This virus has off-late demonstrated mutations thus making it difficult for the health professionals to adopt a uniform means of cure. Many people due to lack of support have confined themselves at home. The hospitals too are running short of equipment and support systems. Thus, computational connectivity between the patients at home and the hospitals needs to be established. The objective of this paper is to propose a framework/model that connects all the stakeholders so that either in regular monitoring or in emergency cases help can be provided to them. It has been well established through research and case studies that critical factors associated with this disease are oxygen level (SPO2), pulse rate, fever, chest infection, cough causing choking, and breathlessness. Data shall be collected, stored, and analyzed for the above symptoms and for this cloud storage and blockchain technology would be used. It has been established through various studies that non-clinical techniques like AI and machine learning prove to be effective for the prediction and diagnosis of COVID-19. Using this theory as the standard basis, machine learning models like SVM, Naïve Bayes, and decision trees can be used for the analysis, diagnosis, and prediction. Using IoT and its variants, remote monitoring of patient, and consultation can be provided to the patient. Appropriate action would be taken. In addition, a mobile application would enable the patients to gather or read about experiences of other patients. Thus, it would be established through the proposed framework, that an integrated approach of technologies has a great potential in such applications and offers several advantages.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Developing and enhancing societal capacity to understand, debate elements of, and take actionable steps toward a sustainable future at a scale beyond the individual are critical when addressing sustainability challenges such as climate change, resource scarcity, biodiversity loss, and zoonotic disease. Although mounting evidence exists for how to facilitate individual action to address sustainability challenges, there is less understanding of how to foster collective action in this realm. To support research and practice promoting collective action to address sustainability issues, we define the term “collective environmental literacy” by delineating four key potent aspects: scale, dynamic processes, shared resources, and synergy. Building on existing collective constructs and thought, we highlight areas where researchers, practitioners, and policymakers can support individuals and communities as they come together to identify, develop, and implement solutions to wicked problems. We close by discussing limitations of this work and future directions in studying collective environmental literacy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) are one of the heaviest polluted regions of the world due to myriad anthropogenic sources and high population density. The PM 2.5 concentrations of IGP peak during October – November due to widespread paddy-residue burning. The present study seeks to determine the mortalities attributable to elevated PM 2.5 levels during the stubble burning (SB) season through the risk of mortality/morbidity due to air pollution (Ri-MAP) model. WHO AirQ+\\u2009model was utilized to evaluate the total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortalities at the district-level in Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi for the year 2019. Here, attributable proportion concept was employed to determine the percentage of annual fine PM-related mortalities caused due to high pollution levels of the SB season, i.e., TM sb %. Patiala, Rohtak, New Delhi recorded the highest TM sb % in their respective states in 2019. Despite practically no cases of SB, the highest mortalities per 100,000 people was observed in Delhi. The results of the study indicate that SB activity exacerbates the health risk in populous locations with already high base levels of PM 2.5 like Delhi, Faridabad, Gurugram, and Jalandhar thereby causing an acute stress on fine PM-related mortalities. Gauging the impact of SB from the lens of attributable mortalities proves to be a compelling tool to draw the attention of policy formulators toward forming a systemic policy for tackling this public health peril.',\n",

This paper takes a closer look at the cardiology telemonitoring to shed light on the technology adoption in the healthcare system. While, on the one hand, healthcare professionals have known how to quickly gear up to respond to the new constraints, on the other it seems that the stakeholders of the system show mixed feelings about them.

       "  'abstract': 'Several epidemiological studies have provided evidence of a causal relationship between the development of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and whole-body vibration exposure. EU Directive 2002/44/EC was published by the European Parliament to ensure the health and safety of each worker and create a minimum protection basis for all community workers by timely detection of adverse health effects arising or likely to arise from exposure to mechanical vibration, especially MSDs. This standard defines the methods for assessing daily vibration exposure (defined in ISO2631-1:1997). ISO 2631-5:2004 defines the method for assessing long-term exposure. Recently, this standard has been modified by ISO 2631-5:2018. This study analysed the differences between the assessment methods defined in the three standards and determined the contributions made by the last standard. The consideration of posture and anthropometric characteristics, the vertebral levels as well as not only considering the acceleration transmitted through the seat are the most important considerations provided by ISO 2631-5:2018.

In addition it was illustrated the steps of medical waste dispose from the stage of collection to disposal. The study concluded that the system followed in the Gaza Strip is one of the most prestigious information used in the world. The research recommended many approaches and tasks to be achieved in future days such as training workers inside health institutions, whether they are doctors, nurses, or workers, on how to deal with medical waste. In addition, it is recommended for providing security and safety requirements for the health of workers, including disinfectants, uniforms. Moreover, Ministry of Health should inspect private facilities to compel them to separate hazardous waste and contract with the Council to dispose of it according to the rules.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Mosquitoes of the Aedes species (Ae. Aegypti and Ae. Albopictus) are transmitters of diseases such as: Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika and Yellow Fever. Given the levels of morbidity and mortality, these tropical pathologies represent a global public health issue, however these diseases can be contained through timely diagnosis and preventive actions in the early stages. Dengue not only impacts upon the health of the population, but also affects economic and social factors, as well as the health system as a whole. With this in mind, this chapter analyses the impact of Dengue on healthcare institutions and proposes a simulation model using the Systems Dynamics methodology, which allows for the design and evaluation of strategies that reduce the impact of dengue upon the health system.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Rapid urbanization in developing economies like India has led to an increase in motorized modes of transport, even for shorter trips replacing Non-Motorized Transport (NMT). The urban lifestyle has made most of the adult population physically less active leading to adverse health impacts. Studies suggest that active transportation, usually through bicycling and walking, can potentially increase Physical Activity (PA) and improve health. In this study, an attempt has been made to quantify PA in terms of Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) for NMT. Two scenarios, such as base case and mode shift to NMT, are evaluated in which the latter scenario shows a 5% increase in the active population and 3% increase in the physically benefitted individuals due to the shift to active transportation. Thus, the population commuting through NMT are sufficiently physically active than other road users and, hence, are less subjected to obesity and other non-communicable diseases.',\n",

COVID-19 affects people differently, with some people remaining asymptomatic, some exhibiting mild symptoms and others developing severe complications. As of November 2020, more than 61,000,000 people have been identified to have contracted the infection and more than 1,440,000 associated deaths have been confirmed globally. Given the varied response of infected people and the ease with which the disease is spreading, many measures have been adopted world wide to minimize the spread of the disease. These steps include lockdowns, controlled operations in cities, travel bans and restrictions, work from home, ban on gatherings, the use of masks, social distancing practices, isolation and quarantine practices and frequent washing of hands. The measures adopted have triggered a plethora of environmental effects some positive and some negative. The purpose of this paper is to highlight various environmental impacts of the COVID -19 globally and to recognize critical environmental issues magnified by the outbreak.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Doctors and health workers are the key front-liners fighting relentlessly to save human lives from various diseases and hidden enemies, such as germs and microbes, since the dawn of civilisation. However, extreme work pressure due to colossal number of patient with finger-countable health workers and doctors makes it hard to maintain the quality of their service. Medical science is a vast, incredibly complicated, and ever-growing field that make the task of health workers harder and urge them to remain updated always. Hence, an AI assistant to suggest possible diagnosis and treatment options can ease the life of doctors to some extent and keep them updated. Existing clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) are either knowledge-based or pattern-based, and very few of them are for personalised care. In this paper, we propose and develop (a prototype version of) a heterogeneous CDSS using pattern mining, machine learning, and knowledge-based techniques. Finally, we conclude the paper with scopes for future extension of the proposed system.',\n",

The data is stored in the Google Fit™ platform and analyzed using a set of rules to detect possible arrhythmia. The application is able to detect arrhythmia thanks to: (a) its synchronization with the wearable device (i.e. smart band) and (b) real-time patient monitoring.

Hence, to have adequate site supervision, inspection, and training, BIM gradually incorporates digital technologies such as automatic rule checking, Augmented and Virtual Reality. This review aims to provide a general overview of building information modelling (BIM) approaches to improve construction workers’ health and safety. In addition, identifying the most exploited tools, frameworks, and BIM dimensions and simultaneously listing the target groups, risks, construction fields, and locations. This short review is based on the findings of a systematic review involving 90 articles in the field of BIM-based health and safety in construction. The health and safety research field is becoming more investigated with several methods for risk prevention and maintaining health and safety during the project lifecycle. The authors mainly addressed fall-related risks while developing solutions to assisting safety managers with monitoring and inspection. Implementing and utilising BIM for health and safety has various limitations since every tool represents a standalone solution. BIM dimensions are still misunderstood, while BIM models still lack the standardisation and link to health and safety regulations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Greece was heralded as a success story in the way the government responded to the coronavirus crisis, compared to other EU member states. Greece managed to tackle the first wave of COVID-19 with a low number of fatalities, without overburdening its frail public healthcare system. The Greek government responses were characterised by high centralisation of decision-making, driven by expert advice, consistency and clarity of message which contributed to the success above. This was surprising, considering the long-term effect of austerity on healthcare provision and the series of failed administrative reforms as a result of the Eurozone crisis. This chapter outlines the Greek response, arguing that government policy followed pre-existing patterns of administrative and institutional architecture, as well as cultural specificities and state–society relations patterns. We demonstrate the response reflected the capacity of the state to command and control its citizens but also achieve the targets that it set out in its response, i.e. saving lives over the economy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Behaviour often reflects the circumstances of the individual, and school behaviour problems, difficult as they are for schools, are often a marker of a range of underlying concerns. Many young people are not prepared for the academic pressures that come into play in secondary education or find their circumstances are not conducive to patiently and calmly endure the long days in formal education. Some have never really settled to the rigours of formal schooling, and as puberty expresses itself in these students, the impulses to break out, assert themselves or express their unhappiness become stronger. These are the students who are described as ‘challenging’, ‘disruptive’ and ‘disengaged’. This study involved working with six groups of students who had been identified as demonstrating severe behaviour and in need of some additional intervention beyond the classroom to learn and rediscover the value of working within the mainstream classroom. Part of a bigger study examining youth resources and resilience, the component of the study reported here examined the presentation of these young people over a six-month period, as they left behind their mainstream schools and worked in a withdrawal setting over 10 to 20\\xa0weeks, returning to their mainstream program one day a week. Students completed a depression inventory, and their teachers rated their competence, attention, and mental health issues before and after the program. The programs work on motivating the students to contain their behaviour and work for change. Follow-up measures recorded improvements in key measures and reduction in depression scores. This study has implications for flexibility in attitudes to inclusion, as a structured ‘time-out’ assisted in reducing scores around aggression and rule breaking, and improved sustained attendance for a substantial proportion of these students.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Educational institutions can elevate student perspective and activation so that playful learning is formed by looking for new teaching possibilities. Didactical methods need to provide a safe environment where students can focus on interpersonal interactions with patients while being aware of how their own emotions can influence their situational awareness and decisions. The authors believe that relevant scenarios in a 360-degree video format will be beneficial for nursing students, specifically in preparation for the clinical setting. The potential of 360-degree video in virtual reality (VR) gives the instructor flexibility to create systematic, experiential learning and shapes emotional learning in collaboration with students. 360-Degree video can be seen as a playful way to learn in new situations. Playfulness of this kind can affect teachers and students motivation, as well as the opportunity to promote learning. This field lacks studies exploring the use of 360-degree videos in psychiatric simulation settings. This chapter will provide knowledge about the practical use of 360-degree video in VR, insight into technical potential, as well as challenges. Background information on why this method is suitable for promoting nursing students’ competence in mental health work will be presented. Another function of this chapter is to give an introduction and inspire exploration of 360-degree video in VR in professional education, with particular focus on how this can be used as a tool for nursing students in psychiatric simulation settings, like the VR-SIMI model, which is discussed later in the chapter.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'With the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, health systems were forced to adapt their intra- and extra-hospital processes through mechanisms of articulation, integration, and coordination between the organic units of public and private institutions, configuring a single national health system. In this sense, the objective of this study was to determine whether there is a relationship between clinical management for the hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 and resolution capacity functionality in a Health Network. A hypothetical deductive method was used with a descriptive-correlational analysis with a cross-sectional design. The sample consisted of 150 health care workers (100%). The selection was conducted in 3 level I-4 facilities of the Contumazá-Cajamarca Health Network, Peru, 2021. The dependent variable was resolution capacity functionality, and the independent variable was clinical management for the hospitalization of patients with COVID-19. The results suggest an average level both in clinical management and in resolution capacity functionality and the transport dimension in 45.3%, extending a significant relationship (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) with Rho\\u2009=\\u20090.755 and Rho\\u2009=\\u20090.251, respectively.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Mental health is one of the most significant public health challenges. In recent years, several motivational applications have been proposed to help users maintain good mental health. However, many times these applications focus on uplifting messages or general resources that are not tailored to the specific needs of their users. In contrast, non-profit organizations implement effective methods to support people based on their real needs and set concrete attainable objectives. Unfortunately, these organizations tend to be saturated by the number of clients and the lack of automatization in their processes. In this paper, we present a proposal to improve mental health organizations’ data collection and decision processes through a web application, allowing workers to store, access, and modify client data more efficiently. The computerized model is exploited by an intelligent conversational assistant to provide around-the-clock personalized and ubiquitous interaction with clients to encourage engagement with the organization.',\n",

The data retrieval and integration systems experience challenges arise due to polystore. The Healthcare data retrieval applications combine the patient data from specialized clinical data stores. Resolving the heterogeneity of the data sources through transformation in single common data model is expensive and cannot be efficiently accomplished with Extract, Transform and Load (ETL)-based frameworks.

       "  'abstract': 'Arsenic (As) contamination of ground water and soil has become a global issue by virtue of its carcinogenicity and toxicity to human and animal health, and is related to both geogenic and anthropogenic sources. Exposure to As occurs primarily by the consumption of contaminated drinking water or food. Its dissolution as a result of redox reactions leads to natural prevalence of As in ground water. Several countries have reported the presence of As in drinking water beyond threshold limits such as India, Bangladesh, Mexico, Thailand and Chile, etc. Its toxicity results in the prostate, lung and skin cancer, skin lesions, rhagades, mitochondrial damage, and may interrupt the\\xa0DNA repair system. Conventional physicochemical techniques for As remediation are costly and generate toxic products. However, bioremediation technique involving the use of microorganisms, plants or genetically modified organisms, etc. can be efficiently opted as a sustainable and cost-effective technology. Microorganisms evolve several mechanisms such as As oxidation or reduction, methylation or intracellular bioaccumulation in stressed environments. This chapter reviews the possible roles offered by the microorganism in the effective remediation of As from soil–water systems. Moreover, various advancements in the field of bioremediation have been discussed. Different challenges to microorganism-based remediation technologies are also explained.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The life course perspective is used in analysis of the older workers relations to the labour market in a societal context. Transition to the market economy of Albania has increased the vulnerability especially for two categories: the youngest, as the new entries into the labour market, and the oldest workers, who found it difficult to be adjusted to the labour market demand, after the failure of state enterprises, changes in working environments, social services, family, etc. The investigation of older workers in the labour market is focused on five dimensions: (1) the labour market structure and employment status of older workers; (2) the employment & VET policies; (3) the work-life balance with ageing; (4) health and (5) retirement. In the beginning of 1990s, the early retirement was the first policy intervention to cope with massive unemployment of older workers. Then, the parametric reforms of PAYG social insurance for increasing the retirement ages and the insurance period have had an impact on extending the working life of older workers of 10\\xa0years until 2018. However, the replacement rate was lowering from 74.2% in 1990, to 56% in 1993 when reform started, to further 41% in 2018 which impose pensioners to continue working or delaying the retirement. The increased youth unemployment, atypical and informal employment, has been new challenges for older workers to be adjusted to the labour market demand and only 10% of them can continue working after the retirement age. The development of employment services, VET, health care and social protection have been inadequate to promote social inclusion of older workers. In the framework of the EU integration, Albania has pursued a process of harmonization the legal framework with EU standards. National strategies have been enacted to guarantee human rights, gender equality, and an inclusive society. The social inclusion of older workers into the labour market is a complex issue that depended not only of the Government interventions, but also by the active engagement of other stakeholders. In the Albanian tradition family continues to be a strong supporting institution for older people and children, very likely to the Abbado’s idea in Italy. This chapter is based on an analysis of policy documents, research and statistics from INSTAT, Eurostat, World Bank, etc. The Eurofound’s European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) 2015, and European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) 2016 are used to identify age and gender patterns regarding work-life balance and social inclusion. The analysis suggests that to fully address the complexity of the inclusion of older workers in the labour market, an integrated approach should involve all relevant policy areas such as education, health, employment, and social protection, as well as engagement of all community stakeholders.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Vision Zero is a term mainly connected with road traffic safety and has its roots in the Swedish road safety strategy. It was formally adopted by the Swedish parliament in 1997, and due to the initial success of lowering the number of deaths in traffic crashes significantly, it has become a role model for road safety strategies in countries and cities all over the world. In Sweden, Vision Zero for road safety has also inspired the introduction of Vision Zero policies in other sectors, and this chapter focuses on Vision Zero from a multi-sectoral perspective. The purpose of this chapter is twofold: to present five different cases of Vision Zero policies and to discuss what constitutes a Vision Zero policy based on these five cases. The five cases are found in road traffic safety, fire safety, patient safety, suicide, and workplace safety. Every case has its unique preconditions in terms of laws, actors, scope, etc., but they are also similar in relation to injury prevention and the ambition to decrease the number of deaths and serious injuries. The five Vision Zero policies are summarized by presenting the problem and problem framing, the goal, measures, and solutions as well as leading actors and governing structures. We find that the problem itself is quite self-explanatory in each case but that the problem framing and attribution of responsibility differ. All cases have on paper been inspired by the road safety strategies, but the systems approach, so intimately connected with Vision Zero, is more or less absent in the cases of fire safety and suicide. Furthermore, in the field of fire safety, responsibility is placed on the individual and on the business sector rather than based on a shared responsibility and ultimately on the system designers. In all five cases, there are a set of measures in place, but there are differences in implementation due to temporal factors and also what kind of governing and steering structures are in place. There is also a difference in internal support where the Vision Zero for suicide stands out as having less support among agencies working with the issue. Finally, the monitoring systems differ from case to case. The Vision Zero for road traffic safety stands out as having a monitoring and evaluating system based on specific safety targets ultimately aiming toward zero (management by objectives). Based on the empirical findings, we argue that besides having a clear problem and problem framing, a toolbox of measures, a monitoring system, and a governing structure, a policy based on a visionary approach with an ambition to reach zero needs additional perspectives or criteria in order to be successful: (1) a scientific approach to problem framing and solutions, (2) a comprehensive approach, (3) a long-term commitment, and (4) a system and structure based on governance . These criteria do not necessarily have to be in place in order to adopt Vision Zero, but they are a prerequisite for building a system based on Vision Zero.',\n",

In this study, a cross-sectional household survey of the most frequently mentioned nutri/medicinal plants that are used in anaemia management in Kilifi County of Kenya was done. The results obtained show that anaemia is a notable intractable nutritional disorder in the malaria-endemic region of Kilifi County. Out of the 541 households that were sampled, 92.8% mentioned that they had experienced an episode in the past 3\\xa0years. Most of the households (95.7%) that used herbal medicine to treat anaemia reported 78.1% complete recovery (self-reported recovery) from anaemia. Most of the nutri/medicinal plants mentioned are either fruits or vegetables that are used to manage anaemia. Collectively, extracts of Morus alba L . and Moringa oleifera Lam. were mentioned to be safe supporting their application for use as novel food ingredient or product . It is therefore evident that food can be used as medicine. More clinical studies need to be carried out to establish the safety and efficacy of different nutri/medicinal plant extracts.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Online support groups offer low-cost and accessible health and mental health support, but low engagement challenges their effectiveness. To encourage engagement and provide evidence-based responses appropriate to participants’ needs, we propose an intent detection model for online support groups based on state-of-the-art natural language processing methods. Such a model enables a chatbot that can increase interactions and improve discussion quality. Posts in social media are often short and noisy, especially in group chat. Furthermore, many intents lack data, overlap and/or have specific priorities. We create a human-annotated dataset of posts with intent labels from 45 three-month online support groups for quitting smoking. We then train and examine models to predict the intent behind each post. To reduce the effect of noisy and sparse data, we fine-tune a massive pretrained language model. Also, to represent the unique relationships between intents, we design customized loss functions for training. Empirical evaluations show significant performance improvements with the proposed method; our best model obtains 95.5% accuracy. We also use a fine-grained set of intents and obtain higher accuracy compared to prior models on online health forums and communities. Accurate detection of fine-grained intents opens up new opportunities to improve online self-help support groups.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Aims/hypothesis Using a targeted proteomics approach, we aimed to identify and validate circulating proteins associated with impaired glucose metabolism (IGM) and type 2 diabetes in a Black South African cohort. In addition, we assessed sex-specific associations between the validated proteins and pathophysiological pathways of type 2 diabetes. Methods This cross-sectional study included Black South African men ( n =380) and women ( n =375) who were part of the Middle-Aged Soweto Cohort (MASC). Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to determine fat mass and visceral adipose tissue, and fasting venous blood samples were collected for analysis of glucose, insulin and C-peptide and for targeted proteomics, measuring a total of 184 pre-selected protein biomarkers. An OGTT was performed on participants without diabetes, and peripheral insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index), HOMA-IR, basal insulin clearance, insulin secretion (C-peptide index) and beta cell function (disposition index) were estimated. Participants were classified as having normal glucose tolerance (NGT; n =546), IGM ( n =116) or type 2 diabetes ( n =93). Proteins associated with dysglycaemia (IGM or type 2 diabetes) in the MASC were validated in the Swedish EpiHealth cohort (NGT, n =1706; impaired fasting glucose, n =550; type 2 diabetes, n =210). Results We identified 73 proteins associated with dysglycaemia in the MASC, of which 34 were validated in the EpiHealth cohort. Among these validated proteins, 11 were associated with various measures of insulin dynamics, with the largest number of proteins being associated with HOMA-IR. In sex-specific analyses, IGF-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) was associated with lower HOMA-IR in women (coefficient –0.35; 95% CI –0.44, –0.25) and men (coefficient –0.09; 95% CI –0.15, –0.03). Metalloproteinase inhibitor 4 (TIMP4) was associated with higher insulin secretion (coefficient 0.05; 95% CI 0.001, 0.11; p for interaction=0.025) and beta cell function (coefficient 0.06; 95% CI 0.02, 0.09; p for interaction=0.013) in women only. In contrast, a stronger positive association between IGFBP2 and insulin sensitivity determined using an OGTT (coefficient 0.38; 95% CI 0.27, 0.49) was observed in men ( p for interaction=0.004). A posteriori analysis showed that the associations between TIMP4 and insulin dynamics were not mediated by adiposity. In contrast, most of the associations between IGFBP2 and insulin dynamics, except for insulin secretion, were mediated by either fat mass index or visceral adipose tissue in men and women. Fat mass index was the strongest mediator between IGFBP2 and insulin sensitivity (total effect mediated 40.7%; 95% CI 37.0, 43.6) and IGFBP2 and HOMA-IR (total effect mediated 39.1%; 95% CI 31.1, 43.5) in men. Conclusions/interpretation We validated 34 proteins that were associated with type 2 diabetes, of which 11 were associated with measures of type 2 diabetes pathophysiology such as peripheral insulin sensitivity and beta cell function. This study highlights biomarkers that are similar between cohorts of different ancestry, with different lifestyles and sociodemographic profiles. The African-specific biomarkers identified require validation in African cohorts to identify risk markers and increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes in African populations.

       "  'abstract': \"Recently, big data and machine learning have become increasingly important in various environments, including health care, industry, government, scientific research, business organizations, social networking, and natural resource management. In particular, they apply to the field of health care and make it possible to process and analyze many data that humans or traditional computer tools cannot do simultaneously. Big data and machine learning are having a significant influence on the health care business, and their analyses may help the whole industry. The opportunities they will create will serve as a springboard for the future of the health care business. This will lead to a paradigm shift, shifting the industry's focus from disease-based diagnosis to patient-based diagnosis. This article will discuss big data technology, including its definition, characteristics, technology, relationship, and influence on the healthcare industry.

       "  'abstract': 'Lithuania has been among the first countries in the EU to impose the lock-down in mid-March 2020, to contain the pandemic on the basis of the suppression strategy. The economic support plan was adopted fast and relatively large sums of money foreseen, but soon had to be adjusted as too cumbersome procedures slowed down the disbursement of funds. The executive government, especially prime minister and minister of health, have been the most visible actors. The politics of crisis management in Lithuania is interesting because it took place in the background of parliamentary elections scheduled in October 2020 with opposition contesting many measures proposed by the ruling centre-left coalition government. In December 2020, the newly formed centre-right coalition government re-imposed country-wide lock-down measures under the second quarantine which lasted for 8\\xa0months till summer 2021. The executive government remained the key actor within the crisis management process, relying mostly on health care experts in their decision-making. Generally, the patterns of governance under two different ruling coalitions have been characterised by the dominance of executive government usual in the times of normal politics. Politics of crisis management resembled the typical confrontational politics characteristic to Lithuania.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the last decades, the diffusion in Italian Public Healthcare Organizations (PHOs) of accounting and managerial practices, centered on planning and budgeting, have increased doctors’ presence into management roles. Clinical heads of units, becoming budget holders, have to face new accountability purposes. However, PHOs still struggle in implementing effectively hybrid professionalism, due to doctor-managers’ resistance to use budgetary information for decision-making. To overcome these criticalities, doctor-managers’ involvement in PHOs’ budgeting process may be beneficial, as highlighted by Behavioral Management Accounting research on budgetary participation. Nevertheless, without the support of openness in communication with top management, doctor-managers’ hybrid nature might lead them to develop a cognitive distance that may do not fit their predisposition to participate. A strengthening of their involvement in the budgetary information features design might mitigate these risks. In the BMA perspective, this paper explores the role of perceptions of openness in communication in improving the predisposition of doctor-managers to participate in the budgeting process, via the indirect effect of perceived utility of budgetary information. Data were collected administering a questionnaire to 332 doctor-managers of Italian PHOs. The response rate was of 37.95%. Hypotheses were tested through a regression analysis. Our study contributes to the interpretative research on the organizational factors affecting the involvement of doctor-managers in PHOs’ management, offering new insights into the psychological antecedents of budgetary participation. Results show that: perceptions of openness in communication have a positive effect on perceived utility of budgetary information; this latter has a positive effect on budgetary participation of doctor-managers.',\n",

Drawing on life course and developmental theories, with particular attention to racial, ethnic, and other intersectional identities, it will also address engagement across the lifespan. In addition, this chapter will draw on family systems theory to explore changes in family structure over time and how such changes have influenced ways of engaging fathers. Specific subgroups of fathers are explored in more detail, including teen fathers, first-time fathers, fathers with multiple partners and households, and grandfathers. This chapter concludes by discussing strategies for engaging diverse fathers that are part of many different family structures and relationships.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The EU is certainly not unfamiliar with crisis management, at least not in the broad sense of the term. Its history is marked by crises and the last ten years were even labelled a polycrisis. This seemed to end after the 2019 European Parliament elections with a new Commission that wanted to prepare the EU for geopolitical policy-making that went beyond crisis management. However, the Covid-19 pandemic caused one of the biggest crises to ever hit the Union. After initial hesitation and criticism, the EU’s institutions showed remarkably strong resilience, combining short-term crisis management with mid-term policy-making and long-term innovative solutions for a number of long-standing political hot topics. This chapter analyses the EU’s response by looking at its institutions and discussing how they behaved—vis-à-vis the Member States and on the world stage—as primary actors of its Covid-19 crisis management.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Understanding safety culture in an organization can make a significant contribution to changing employee attitudes and behaviors in relation to workplace health and safety. Many studies have shown the importance of element that leads to broad behaviors, or culture actions, that are considered essential to the development of a positive safety culture in a workplace mostly in high-hazard industries, but less is done in the education sector. The aim of this research paper is to identify areas of improvement that can be addressed by managerial decisions and also policy activities in the Malaysian education sector, in creating academic organizations as a safe workplace for teachers and students. Therefore, this study was to analyze the relationship between factors that contribute to safety culture, analyzing through the Importance-Performance Matrix Analysis (IPMA) what the aspects to improve by the management to increase a safe working condition in the education sector, using PLS-SEM. Data were collected from 447 academic staff from Vocational Colleges using a cross-sectional survey by using a multi-stage sampling. Several components such as safety training, safety knowledge, PPE, safety communication, safety rule and the influence of peers significantly contribute to the positive safety culture in vocational training as the managerial need to keep up the great effort in bringing these element in this sector. Malaysian Ministry of Education should place OSH Education as a separate course in curriculums of vocational and technical schools at all levels. Furthermore, legal regulations must be included in OSH Education so that all staffs and students grasp the legal status and importance of OSH.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Randomized, clinical trials have established the efficacy of screening mammography in improving survival from breast cancer for women through detection of early, asymptomatic disease. However, disparities in survival rates between black women and women from other racial and ethnic groups following breast cancer diagnosis persist. Various professional groups have different, somewhat conflicting, guidelines with regards to recommended age for commencing screening as well as recommended frequency of screening exams, but the trials upon which these recommendations are based were not specifically designed to examine benefit among black women. Furthermore, these recommendations do not appear to incorporate the unique epidemiological circumstances of breast cancer among black women, including higher rates of diagnosis before age 40 years and greater likelihood of advanced stage at diagnosis, into their formulation. In this review, we examined the epidemiologic and socioeconomic factors that are associated with breast cancer among black women and assess the implications of these factors for screening in this population. Specifically, we recommend that by no later than age 25 years, all black women should undergo baseline assessment for future risk of breast cancer utilizing a model that incorporates race (e.g., Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool [BCRAT], formerly the Gail model) and that this assessment should be conducted by a breast specialist or a healthcare provider (e.g., primary care physician or gynecologist) who is trained to assess breast cancer risk and is aware of the increased risks of early (i.e., premenopausal) and biologically aggressive (e.g., late-stage, triple-negative) breast cancer among black women.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Rice is a staple food in most of the Asian countries and arsenic contamination in rice grain as well as cooked rice is one of the most distressing subjects in recent times. Arsenic translocates in rice plants in a descending manner from root to stem followed by leaf and grain. The present study finds the same descending translocation pattern in paddy grains of a single pedicel of paddy plants in both the arsenic exposed and control sites. The distribution of arsenic gets reduced with height, i.e. paddy grains located in the top part of a pedicel accumulates lowest amount of arsenic. Average arsenic concentration is found to be highest in the rice grains of lower part of the pedicels (272, 205 and 162\\xa0µg/kg) followed by middle (257, 176 and 156\\xa0µg/kg) and top (220, 162 and 115\\xa0µg/kg), respectively in exposed fields (Teghoria and Madhusudankathi) and control field (Pingla). The average decrease percentage of arsenic in whole paddy grains of a single pedicel from lower part to top is found to be 17.6% which is less than the control site (34%). The present study also showed the distribution variation of arsenic concentration and content among different parts of a whole paddy grain. The ratio of average arsenic concentration between rice grain and rice husk (1.15) is observed to be higher compared to the ratio of their average arsenic content (0.26). Interaction of micronutrients (zinc and selenium) present in rice grain has also been studied in comparison to arsenic. This study is also important for understanding the degree of arsenic exposure through consumption of cooked rice. Cooked rice arsenic concentration is governed by several factors where cooking water arsenic concentration plays a major role determining the flow of arsenic between rice and water. The present study observed that arsenic released from cooked rice to water during cooking with five differently arsenic concentrated waters; however, the rate of arsenic discharge percentage got decreased with increasing water arsenic concentration. The reduction percentage of arsenic from cooked rice to water was also found to be variety and cultivar dependent. Therefore, at domestic level, it is recommended to cook rice with arsenic safe water with proper and regular water quality monitoring.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Fad diets among adolescents and young adults (AYA) are often thought to be phenomena of the Western World only. Contrary to this, these “trends” have been increasingly witnessed among AYA in the Eastern World over the past several years, and as such, nutrition-related morbidities have increased in these regions. Numerous socioecological determinants have contributed to this. In this chapter, we shed light on these determinants, which have been associated with the transition of dietary behaviors in the relatively conservative and/or traditional settings of many countries of the Eastern World, and describe some of the more common fad diets of these areas. An understanding of this is important for any adult working with AYA, so as to impart socioculturally empathetic and relevant care, nutritional screening, and counseling.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Distributed Optical Fiber Sensors (DOFS) show several inherent benefits with respect to conventional strain-sensing technologies and represent a key technology for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). Despite the solid motivation behind DOFS-based SHM systems, their implementation for real-time structural assessment is still unsatisfactory outside academia. One of the main reasons is the lack of rigorous methodologies for uncertainty quantification, which hinders the performance assessment of the monitoring system. The concept of Probability of Detection (POD) should function as the guiding light in this process, but precautions must be taken to apply this concept to SHM, as it has been originally developed for Non-Destructive Evaluation techniques. Although DOFS have been the object of numerous studies, a well-established methodology for their performance evaluation in terms of PODs is still missing. In the present work, the concept of Probability of Delamination Detection (POD 2 ) is proposed for a DOFS network; Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) Double-Cantilever Beam (DCB) specimens equipped with DOFS have been tested under static loading, and the strain patterns along with the relative observed delamination size have been collected to generate an adequate database for the POD analysis, suggesting a reference methodology to quantify the performance of DOFS for delamination detection.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Data and information have become a valuable asset for small and big organizations in the past few decades. Data is the main ingredient for strategic decision-making, which could give businesses a significant advantage over their competitors, by providing customized services or overall experience to their customers and attracting new ones. For this purpose, data mining techniques are being utilized so that valuable information can be discovered and exploited. There is a vast amount of data generated in the field of healthcare that is not getting fully exploited by traditional methods, for reasons, such as their complexity, velocity, and volume. Therefore, there is a demand for the development of powerful automated data mining tools for the complete utilization of these data, and the uncovering of patterns and precious knowledge about patients, medical claims, treatment costs, hospitals, etc. This work focuses on exploiting the best-known data mining techniques: classification, clustering, and association rule mining, which are utilized extensively in the healthcare industry for incident prediction and general medical knowledge acquisition. The data mining process comprises several steps, such as data selection, pre-processing, transformation, interpretation, and evaluation. The section of the experimentation includes a stroke incidents dataset fetched from the Kaggle dataset provider. This chapter also provides a literature survey on data mining applications in the healthcare sector, while discussing the abovementioned machine learning concepts.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This chapter addresses various forms of refugee recognition, ranging from group-based to individual-based, that influence refugees’ resettlement pathways and experiences of third country resettlement. It begins with individual recognition, a mode that is widely used in many European countries, and then shifts to group-based recognition, also known as prima facie or temporary protection. The chapter then explores newly implemented approaches, such as accelerated/simplified procedures, merged registration, or merged resettlement processes. The chapter provides insight into the strengths and weaknesses of these diverse approaches to refugee recognition. It also discusses the interview process for refugee status determination (RSD) purposes, the best practices and skills needed in RSD interviewing, and the quality of RSD interviewing. The process of resettlement, one of the three durable solutions to displacement, is described, as well as the application and approval process in various country signatories of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, which binds signatories to resettle refugees in their communities. The chapter concludes by highlighting the importance of social workers in the process of resettlement and supporting refugees through this process in a third country.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Sexual orientation has been the subject of study by scientists for over a century. If in the past the scientific interest revolved around the question of “nature or nurture,” the current theories of sexology, which are placed in a sociological, biological, psychological, and social perspective, recognize the multifactorial nature of sexual orientation. However, although there have been socio-cultural and scientific advances with respect to different forms of sexual identity, heteronormativity is widespread in the clinical setting, in research and in society as a whole. People belonging to the LGBQ community are still victims of stigma, violence, and discrimination. Studies that integrate biological, psychological, and socio-relational factors are needed to deepen the idea that not all people develop sexual orientation along an identical path. The integration of a sex-positive approach and a biopsychosocial one among health professionals remains an important goal to be achieved in order to reduce discrimination against sexual minorities, the emotional consequences, and monetary costs on health services that can derive from it.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Over several years, simulation has become an established teaching method in study programs of nursing and other health disciplines. Simulation exercises have a theoretical foundation in a number of perspectives on how adults acquire knowledge, through experience-based learning, reflection-on-action and reflection-in-action, and an emphasis on the sociocultural context. As part of the learning process of simulation, the opportunity for feedback and feed forward is crucial in the learning process. The individual facilitator is particularly important in this understanding of learning. The role of the facilitator is aimed at guiding the student toward learning with the help of didactic and pedagogical methods. Learning in itself is a process that could be defined as a transformation that is not based on biological maturation. In this chapter, we look closer at the nature of train the trainer courses, what separates a facilitator from a lecturer, the significance of a common language and framework, as well as how the side effects and synergies of the facilitator’s skills might benefit academic staff in nursing and other health education programs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This chapter highlights the importance of bridging macro and micro\\xa0social work practice to ensure essential domestic violence services in dynamic contexts, with a focus on the Melanesian region of the South Pacific. The chapter provides background to the Melanesian context, including the critical role of the Pacific women’s rights movement in advocating for policy change at national and regional levels and promoting a human rights-based approach to addressing violence against women and girls (VAWG) in the region. The chapter also examines the importance of building flexible systems, policies, protocols, and response services to meet the needs of women and girls in dynamic development contexts affected by reoccurring national disasters and periodic political instability. A case study from the Solomon Islands highlights the critical role of national and local partnerships in developing systems that can flex before, during, and after emergencies and the importance of establishing quality standards for counseling survivors as part of the essential service response. Understanding the key role of women’s rights organizations, the use of national data and evidence, a strong policy framework, and the partnership development across diverse stakeholders form the foundation of social work knowledge and skills necessary to addressing VAWG in dynamic contexts.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Synchronization discrepancies when measuring structural response may compromise the accuracy of information on the condition of structures, extracted from structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. Loss of synchronization mostly concerns modern wireless SHM systems; however, synchronization discrepancies may also occur in cable-based systems in case multiple data acquisition units without global clock management are used. This paper presents the implementation and validation of a concept towards synchronizing SHM data records containing structural response data, which is imperative for obtaining information valuable for accomplishing monitoring objectives. Specifically, the performance of a cross spectrum synchronization approach reported in a recent study, which builds upon cross spectral density phase angles of structural response data transformed into the frequency domain, is investigated with structural response data from real structures. The cross spectrum synchronization approach is implemented into a wireless SHM system and into a cable-based SHM system, and it is validated through tests on a laboratory shear-frame structure and through field tests on a pedestrian bridge, respectively. The validation test results prove that the cross spectrum synchronization approach is capable of complementing traditional clock synchronization protocols, thus enhancing the accuracy of SHM outcomes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The present report is based on describing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitals in the UAE. Like other nations in the world, the UAE is also hardly hit by this epidemic in terms of public health and the nation’s economy. This sudden emergence of this pandemic created immense pressure on the hospitals, clinics, and healthcare workers. With the exponential rise in the number of infected persons, the healthcare institutions find it overburdened to handle all the patients at a time. The overloading pressure of treating the COVID-19 positive patients by the healthcare professionals has also increased a high risk on their part. Majority of the countries have also lost their healthcare professionals through COVID-19 infection. To address this problem, the following paper will be organized around three sections. In the first section, we will start by studying and comparing the impact of the COVID-19 in the world and in the UAE. In the second section, we will move to discuss more specifically the impact of COVID-19 on the health institutions in UAE. The last section will be reserved to the empirical investigation in which we will focus on studying how the hospitals managed the pandemic, especially regarding their role with the regular patients and their fight against the COVID-19.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Although both positive psychology and religious/spiritual traditions share a common focus on human strengths and holistic development, in mental healthcare, there has been little systematic integration of these fields. In this chapter, we overview key terms and synthesize meta-analytic evidence for spiritually integrated interventions (SIIs), positive psychology interventions (PPIs), and virtue-based interventions (VBIs). Through the lens of virtue ethics, we propose that growth in virtuousness fosters flourishing, which consists of more than the absence of psychological distress and includes greater well-being, meaning in life, relational maturity, and community contribution. We detail a research prospectus guided by virtue ethics to support the development of an integrated line of applied clinical research. In particular, we call for practice-based studies that attend to diversity and equity considerations and address reductionistic misapplications of virtue (which we call virtue bypass ). Finally, we discuss innovative clinical and community applications, including the utility of a dialectical and contextual perspective, the need to consider both individual and communal flourishing, and the potential for communities as intervention sites.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The response to COVID-19 as a public health emergency raised questions about preparedness against future pandemics. The US Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) with medically critical items such as ventilators and personal protection equipment for major public health emergencies proved to be inadequate in the first half of 2020. We seek to address how governments or other disaster management organizations should modify their stockpile approach for a more robust response to disasters than was the case in 2020. To this end, we argue that a “strategic reserve” against rare public health emergencies must not only have inventory but also backup capacity and standby capability. With a highly skewed “demand” distribution reflecting a rarely occurring pandemic or other disasters, we present a three-tiered approach comprising stockpile inventory as the first tier, backup capacity as the second, and standby capability to manufacture as the third.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Health indicators are indices that act as intermediary links between raw SHM data and prognostic models. An efficient HI should satisfy prognostic requirements such as monotonicity, trendability, and prognosability in such a way that it can be effectively used as an input in a prognostic model for remaining useful life estimation. However, discovering or designing a suitable HI for composite structures is a challenging task due to the inherent complexity of the evolution of damage events in such materials. Previous research has shown that data-driven models are efficient for accomplishing this goal. Large labeled datasets, however, are normally required, and the SHM data can only be labeled, respecting prognostic requirements, after a series of nominally identical structures are tested to failure. In this paper, a semi-supervised learning approach based on implicitly imposing prognostic criteria is adopted to design a novel HI suitable. To this end, single-stiffener composite panels were subjected to compression-compression fatigue loading and monitored using acoustic emission (AE). The AE data after signal processing and feature extraction were fused using a multi-layer LSTM neural network with criteria-based hypothetical targets to generate an intelligent HI. The results confirm the performance of the proposed scenario according to the prognostic criteria.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In case of emergency situations like accidents, the doctor may not have the complete medical history of the patient they are dealing with. This may lead to wrong diagnosis and medical errors, which can even cost a life. “About 2.6\\xa0million deaths are caused yearly due to medical mistakes”, said by WHO. Most of which are due to lack of knowledge about the patient’s medical history. This paper proposes a solution which provides the registered users to store and access their medical details in a web application authenticated by username and password. The user details are stored in the form of electronic records. Electronic health records are very useful as they reduce the traditional way of storing patient records where the management may lose some records of patients which can delay the medication of patients. By adopting the use of electronic medical records, medical errors and its adverse effects can be reduced. In severe cases, the victim may not be in a position to brief about his username and password, so the biometric fingerprint authentication is added for the convenience of medical staff to acquire the victim’s medical history. Different medical attributes like blood sugar level, blood pressure, etc. were present alongside the attributes to upload and store X-rays, scan reports, etc. The novelty of the proposed work lies in the implementation of biometric authentication for accessing the EHR. For the fingerprint matching, k-NN algorithm is used in the proposed work. The main motivation behind the proposed work is to reduce improper medications and also proposing a better way to store medical records without losing any record.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Refugees, asylum seekers, and other survivors of forced displacement are impacted by laws, policies, sociocultural influences, and individual actions at every stage of their displacement journey. It is important for practitioners to understand the varied and complex influences across survivors’ social ecology in order to best plan and respond. This introductory chapter to Integrative Social Work Practice with Refugees, Asylum Seekers and Other Forcibly Displaced Persons presents an overview of integrative social work practice across contexts of displacement, argues for increased engagement of social work and social workers in all areas of response, and provides an overview of the edited volume. Integrative Social Work Practice bridges three levels of social work practice—the micro, the mezzo, and the macro—to demonstrate the need for a more integrative conceptualization of practice when working in the humanitarian emergency and refugee resettlement fields. Experts from around the world present key history, laws, policies, theories, practices, and approaches for social workers and other practitioners to effectively attend to individual, family, and community needs, as well as navigate and influence broader structural factors such as policies and frameworks of support and sustainability in humanitarian emergencies, protracted crises, and resettlement.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Tourism industry is the major contributor of the economic development of every nation. In recent years tourism in India has exploded at a very high speed. India has flourished in becoming the most favored place amongst local and foreign travelers. Tourism industry in India is the major contributor for the GDP of the economy, which induces medical tourism which is of recent origin. In recent years India has become a preferred medical tourism destination as high-quality treatment is provided at very low cost as compared to other countries. Tamil Nadu is one among the states in India where one can take the advantage of all-inclusive packages. There are numerous world class amenities available in the hospitals of Tamil Nadu which are well equipped with the newest testing services. Coimbatore is Tamil Nadu’s second largest city located in the foothills of the Nilgiris, is the top revenue earner for the state next to Chennai, with respect to engineering, textile and automotive industries. In the recent years, hospital industry in Coimbatore district is scaling its heights to international standards. In this context, the present study is developed to analyse the potential for medical tourism with reference to the quality of health care services offered by the select private hospitals in Coimbatore city.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This project is the result of a volunteer program that took place in the Republic Guinea-Bissau (RGB) at the Paediatric Hospital. The Paediatric Hospital was working with the same technologic skills as Portugal in the 70’s years. There was no wired network between departments, no informatic system and all work was handmade. The physicians received incomplete clinical reports and, sometimes, with gross errors. There was no triage neither outpatient short list during the medical urgency period. The outpatients needed to wait for long time to get the analytical report and most time without meal or single bread. On the Clinical Analysis Laboratory, the biologic sample identification and the manual data report were lower changes to be credible and there was no final checklist. This paper describes the improvements made by the authors in the hospital logistical processes and in the development and implementation of an information system that was started in March 2018. These improvements were developed based on lean manufacturing principles, on methods and best practices for some referenced case studies from America, Saudi Arabia, Italy and England. As a result, the hospital reduced outpatient waiting time, improved Hospital, Laboratory and outpatient outcomes, increased confidence work for physicians and laboratory technics.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Broadly stated, this book makes the case for a different way of thinking about how to measure and manage person-centered outcomes in health care. The basic contrast is between statistical and metrological definitions of measurement. The mainstream statistical tradition focuses attention on numbers in centrally planned and executed data analyses, while metrology focuses on distributing meaningfully interpretable instruments throughout networks of end users. The former approaches impose group-level statistics from the top down in homogenizing ways. The latter tracks emergent patterns from the bottom up, feeding them back to end users in custom tailored applications, whose decisions and behaviors are coordinated by means of shared languages. New forms of information and knowledge necessitate new forms of social organization to create them and put them to use. The chapters in this book describe the analytic, design, and organizational methods that have the potential to open up exciting new possibilities for systematic and broad scale improvements in health care outcomes.',\n",

These studies were conducted at a university in Norway from 2018 to 2020. The studies used a qualitative approach, and reflection notes and focus group interviews were used to collect data. The participants (81 students in total) were bachelor of nursing students 2nd year public health nursing students, and students in teacher training (healthcare). The interviews were conducted shortly after the students had performed the simulation activity. The students expressed that the simulation provided a higher degree of realism and seriousness than skill training did. They felt that the simulation was an educational method in which they experienced realistic feelings and stress in a serious situation. The students learned that in an emergency, good communication is important to make the right decision. The simulation was perceived as one of the most effective ways to prepare themselves for the profession of nursing. They experienced learning through describing the course of events during the debriefing process and obtaining feedback from other students to reveal the gaps in their knowledge.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Major events and unconventional circumstances impose a series of challenges on leaders around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic crisis which is characterized by constant change and improbability, forced the countries’ leadership to ramp up risk communication efforts. Under this condition, social media platforms played a critical role for quick dissemination of information. Consequently, the current study aims to understand the role of the Saudi Monarchy King Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud on visual health risk communication during the COVID-19 pandemic through social media platforms like Twitter. It explores how virtual space builds an emotional connection to deal with the COVID-19 situation with the local and international community. The research incorporates a multidisciplinary perspective to understand the role of virtual space in constructing an emotional connection with the local and international community in the critical period of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study uses Lasswell’s communication model and Goffman’s dramaturgical framework to review and analyze the official Twitter account “@KingSalman” of King Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud. It explores how social media interaction supports the Saudi Monarchy’s leadership role, comparing front and backstage scripts. The findings indicate that Saudi Monarchy leadership’s influence on virtual space plays an essential part in coping with the COVID-19 crisis and building an emotional connection with the community. It supports enhancing the social capital through bonding, bridging, and linking across Saudi Arabia regions to fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. This study contributes to understanding leadership influence on virtual space and supports dealing with the COVID-19 crisis.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'With more than 600,000 highway bridges, 46.4% of which rated as fair and 7.6% rated in poor condition, United States is one of those countries in which the installation of reliable bridge health monitoring systems is strategically necessary to minimize and optimize repair and rehabilitation costs and to prevent failures. In this review paper, a synthesis of the scientific literature relative to the SHM systems installed in some U.S. bridges over the last 20\\xa0years is presented. This review aims to offer interested readers a holistic perspective of recent and current state-of-the-art in bridge health monitoring systems and to extract a “general paradigm” that is common to many real structures. The review, conducted through a comprehensive search of peer-reviewed documents available in the scientific literature, discusses several bridges in terms of the instrumentation used, scope of the monitoring, and main outcomes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Netherlands is a parliamentary democracy in which the parliament has the ultimate power. All ministers in the Dutch government\\xa0have their own (crisis) authority, the Prime Minister being the primus inter pares without a formal power to overrule any ministerial decision. Numerous governmental advisory bodies have the right to come up with critical reflections. In the creating of\\xa0safety policies, the legislator is required to take into account a public cost–benefit analysis. During times of regional crisis, the mayors of the greater municipalities are legally given the overall command of said crisis\\xa0unless a state of emergency is declared. The Covid-19 response\\xa0in the Netherlands showed another reality in which the Prime Minister and the two ministers responsible for health care de facto took command, advised only by the so-called Outbreak Management Team (OMT) which consists of experts on infectious diseases. No explanation of the OMT advice and the resulting choice of policies were ever published. This centralization of power without a legal basis, as well as the policies that were decided upon, has not been questioned by parliament, mainstream media, the advisory bodies, or decentral authorities. Mild callings for a more integral and proportionate basis for decision-making have been made\\xa0during the crisis, but have not been answered. The explanation for this unprecedented change in governance patterns is, according to all politicians and top civil servants spoken with during advisory talks, a personal fear for accountability\\xa0while faced with policy choices that might kill thousands of vulnerable people in short notice.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The decriminalisation Decriminalisation of sex work facilitates a model of governance in which sex work is removed from the criminal statute and situated more clearly in the framework of labour law Law . Sex workers and other activists have long acknowledged the harms that criminalised regimes cause to sex workers’ psychological, social and economic wellbeing, leaving them with criminal records that preclude participation in other sectors of work, removing from them their children and their places of residence, and amplifying the risks of violence Violence , blackmail and extortion. The success of New Zealand’s Prostitution Reform Act [2003] in the brothel sector, however, depends upon sex workers and brothel operators understanding the provisions of the law and being willing and able to implement them. Drawing on interviews with brothel operators and brothel-based sex workers, this chapter investigates knowledge of the law along with the bureaucratic contexts associated with running brothels as ‘businesses like any other.’ Whilst decriminalisation offers the promise of alleviating the harmful effects of stigma, New Zealand’s brothel operators and sex workers nevertheless continue to experience marginalisation and discrimination. This chapter sets out how they interpret and manage that, particularly through seeking to establish brothels as legitimate and acceptable businesses.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The detection of mental health problems such as depression has become increasingly important, nowadays its increase due to various factors such as the appearance of social networks, a global health crisis that has forced people to isolate themselves in their homes, among others. Unfortunately, these problems are often not detected in time because many people do not have the confidence to express their problems to doctors, psychologists or relevant authorities, causing them to advance to a more critical stage of their condition. However, many people feel more confident sharing their thoughts through social media platforms or chatbots these days, which are a form of liberation where you can lessen the social pressure to express your thoughts through anonymity. That is why this presented study proposes a system with which possible signs of mental health can be detected. This is in a scenario of high school students (young people from 14 to 18\\xa0years old on average) through interaction with the chatbot of the high school of the Autonomous University of Zacatecas, and using conversation flows, the chatbot was deployed during a period where the implementation of sentiment analysis algorithm presented an accuracy of 0.86 showing optimistic data for the detection of signs of problems of mental health.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Healthcare systems worldwide are confronted with numerous challenges such as an aging population, an increasing number of chronically ill patients, innovations as cost drivers and growing cost pressure. The COVID-19 pandemic causes additional burden for healthcare systems. In order to overcome these challenges, digital technologies are increasingly used. Especially the past decade witnessed a tremendous boom of artificial intelligence (AI) within the healthcare sector. AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare and to mitigate the challenges healthcare systems are confronted with. The existing literature has frequently examined specific benefits of AI within the healthcare sector. However, there are still research gaps according to different application areas in healthcare. For this reason, an empirical study design has been conducted to investigate the potentials of AI in healthcare and to consequently identify its role. Based on a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), the following application areas for key determinants in healthcare have been identified: management tasks , medical diagnostics , medical treatment and drug discovery . By means of structural equation modeling (SEM), the study confirmed medical diagnostics and drug discovery as positive and significant influencing factors on the potential benefits of AI in healthcare. The other determinants didn’t prove a significant influence. Based on the findings of the study, various recommendations have been derived to further exploit the potentials of AI in healthcare.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Tuberculosis disease is one of the world's top infectious diseases that leads to a huge number of patient death worldwide. Tuberculosis gradually attacks the lungs of the patients, where Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the main reasons for tuberculosis attacks which are caused by the bacteria. As innovation of new techniques helps generation minimize the tasks or observation period, Machine learning is one of the popular techniques by which a person or an organization can easily build a model to evaluate data, generate ideas, or prediction of values. Machine learning algorithms are used enormously in different sectors, thus using Machine learning models in the health sector increasing rapidly. Health professionals can easily predict or observe a patient's disease using the previous history of the same patient or different similar patient's history. In the paper, tuberculosis patient's death rationale is harmonized from the World Health Organization dataset of tuberculosis disease’s class called causes and deaths, where the country Bangladesh's dataset has been used. Feature of the dataset is one of the main concerns of the patient's death, which is identified using the Machine learning regression and classification algorithm. Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision tree, Random forest, KNN, XGB, Adaboost and algorithms are used in the process to create a model which can identify the best features and it is figured out that Random forest provides the best results. The prediction model for finding the number of death of patients build using the machine learning regression algorithms, where linear regression prediction accuracy is 0.99943, however, the linear model's features selection for the process are not the best noticeable. The random forest algorithm's prediction accuracy was found 0.97820, which is nearest to the linear regression accuracy. In one sentence, it is figured out that Random forest is the best-observed algorithm in both prediction accuracy and feature importance detection.\",\n",

This text summarises and discusses the results of a psychosocial risk assessment conducted among Staff workers from a clothing trading company operating in Portugal. A consistent strategy of analysis and assessment of the psychosocial risks was put in place, which involved different data collection procedures (reports on safety activities, technical meetings, interviews, questionnaire to workers, etc.) and the application of the SSARA Method—Simplified Risk Assessment System adapted to psychosocial risks. The methodological procedure used made it possible to obtain a map of psychosocial risks for the Staff activity in each of the company’s ten stores. The results show that the activity evaluated presents in general an acceptable incidence of psychosocial risks at work, since most of the risk factors evaluated fall under this category (63.5%) and there is no very high incidence of any risk factors. A positive psychosocial work environment in the stores evaluated was confirmed, which results from the good occupational safety and health policies and practices put in place by the company.',\n",

These programs include mostly mothers in their services, but in this chapter, we examine the engagement of fathers in early childhood programs. We begin with a discussion of the context of father involvement and its importance for early child development, then provide an overview of early childhood programs, and describe a few programs that stand out regarding their goals, curricula, and effects. Next, we provide a theoretical framework that we use to synthesize the literature on the effects of early childhood programs serving fathers on their financial contributions and involvement with their child.

       "  'abstract': 'As workers are expected to stay longer in the labor force, the active workforce is ageing more and more every day. Ageing workforce is characterized by the necessity of specific solutions for elderly employees in the workspaces, minding their specific health conditions with a continuous attention, while regarding for other people sharing the same environment. The recent developments in Ambient Intelligence (AmI) field seem a promising solution for the necessities of an ageing workforce. In this work, an ontology-based AmI framework is proposed to enhance the comfort metrics in workplaces, considering the specific physical needs of each worker and collective well-being of all workers at the same time. The framework aims at being the less invasive possible, avoiding direct monitoring of the workers and their activities, relying instead on knowledge related to their status. This paper introduces the framework, its architecture and the underlying ontology. Two scenarios specify the adaptation provided by the framework, while a preliminary validation is presented.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Portugal benefited from late exposure to the COVID pandemic, as the local community transmission was only observed from March 2020 onwards. Portugal’s response to the health crisis was initially framed as a success due to the limited intensity of infection rates. However, this narrative was severely challenged by a spike in daily cases observed in January 2021 due to the lifting of restrictions during the Christmas season. To tackle uncontrolled virus dissemination, the government imposed two periods of national lockdown. In political terms, the health crisis failed to enhance the polarisation of the political system as a close coordination was observed between the Portuguese President of the Republic and the Prime Minister. Likewise, a consensual approach was adopted by the main opposition party towards the government. Nonetheless, the health crisis provoked distress regarding the support of the Portuguese left-wing parties for the Socialist minority government.',\n",

This paper focuses on a smart technical solution to the problem of mental health issues detection related to the stress, sadness, depression, anxiety, etc. which if not handled efficiently may further lead to a severe problem. The paper deals with the designing of an automated smart system using social media posts that will help mental health experts to successfully identify and understand about the mental health condition of social media users. That can be done based on text analysis of rich social media resources such as Reddit, Twitter posts. The implementation of the system is done using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The models are\\xa0trained using a prepared dataset of social media postings. With this automated system the mental health experts can able to detect the stress or some other emotions of social media uses in a very earlier as well as faster way. The proposed system can predict five emotional categories: ‘Happy’, ‘Angry’, ‘Surprise’, ‘Sad’, ‘Fear’ based on machine learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM), deep learning Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and BERT transfer learning algorithms. All the applied algorithms are evaluated using confusion matrix, the highest accuracy and f1 score achieved is more than 85%, which is better than the existing human emotion detection systems.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Managing terrestrial ecosystems for agricultural production affects the climate. This can occur by: (i) conversion of natural ecosystems to agroecosystems which adds carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to the atmosphere, (ii) nitrogen (N) fertilizer production and use adding more greenhouse gases (GHGs), and (iii) compensating for lower yields under organic agriculture (OA) by converting additional areas of natural ecosystems. The entire food system emits currently 16.0 Gt CO 2 e year −1 or one-third of the total global anthropogenic GHG emissions. However, a range of site-specific practices including conventional and OA practices can be combined to reduce overall climate impacts of agricultural production. Among the practices to lessen climate impacts of conventional agriculture is replacing some of the synthetic N fertilizer produced by the Haber-Bosch process responsible for 1.2% of the global anthropogenic CO 2 emissions, with less GHG-intensive manure and management of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). In contrast, allowing some level of mineral N fertilization (e.g., 40% of current average use) would ensure that soils under OA practices are not becoming N-deficient. Enhancing soil health by combining conventional with OA practices may potentially reduce the need for adding climate-negative external inputs. Composite or integrated farming systems combining best conventional and OA practices have become promising with their ability to reduce energy use and global warming potential (GWP). Modern technologies taking advantage of scientific discoveries should be applied in both conventional and OA systems to reduce the negative and promote the positive climate effects of food production. Conventionalization of OA by increasing adopting features of conventional modes of production based on industrial farming methods can potentially reduce climate impacts. Regenerative agriculture (RA) by combining conventional with OA practices enhances ecological processes which may reduce climate effects of agriculture. Overall, many conventional and OA practices are continuously evolving and rather than adhesion to fixed sets of principles, more sustainable and climate-resilient agricultural practices should be developed for site-specific implementation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the DSM V, the condition known as “Gender Identity Disorder” becomes “Gender Dysphoria” in order to avoid the stigma of being labeled as carriers of psychopathology. Gender Dysphoria (GD) refers to mental discomfort deriving by incongruence between the expressed gender and the assigned one. The term Transgender refers to identities or gender expressions that differ from social expectations typically based on the birth assigned sex. Not all people living “Gender Variance” express psychological or physic discomfort. The personal gender identity develops influenced by emotionally significant relationships and by socialeducational environment, based on predisposing biological characteristics. Most of clinical and psycho-social studies agree on multifactorial nature of this process, focusing on the combined action of biological, psychological, social and cultural factors. The first symptoms of gender dysphoria may appear from first years of life and then they may persist in puberty and adulthood. The causes of Gender Dysphoria are still unclear. Both psychosocial and biological factors have been called into question to explain the onset. The Gender Dysphoria Treatment aims to reduce, or to remove, suffering of person with GD and it is based on teamwork of psychologists, psychiatrists, endocrinologists and surgeons. The cure is, firstly, psychological and is provided by mental health experts. Hormone therapy can be prescribed to all people with persistent and well documented Gender Dysphoria if there are no medical contraindications; lastly, sex reassignment surgery. The formation and definition of transgender and transsexual identity obviously represents a specific complexity, to which is added an environmental, cultural and consequently individual and conditioning stigmatization.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'To solve the problem of maintenance lag caused by long-term ocean voyage, a health assessment method is proposed based on the testability model for diesel engine. Firstly, the testability model is applied to generate the “fault-test” correlation matrix and accurately describe the interaction of each module and the fault signal propagation in the system structure; Then, the current health state corresponding to the bottom fault mode can be quickly deduced by using the model to infer the test information entropy; Finally, the health status of the whole diesel engine is evaluated by mapping to the health status of the upper structure through the support vector machine algorithm. The method can be used to determine the maintenance requirements in advance and improve the accuracy of fault prediction.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Though sanitation was given importance since early Harrapan civilizations, in recent times, India is struggling to become an open defecation-free (ODF) country. This paper systematically reviews the philosophical shift in independent India’s sanitation policies and creates a timeline of these events. During 1947- 1980, water and sanitation programs were launched together with 244 urban water supply (WS) schemes, 65 urban sewerage schemes, and 228 rural WS schemes being sanctioned. However, it is very clear from the ratio of sanitation schemes to water schemes that WS coverage has been given more importance than sanitation. This period can be considered as the “water supply coverage era” as also the stationary phase of Indian rural sanitation. During 1981–2008, realizing the importance of sanitation in the development of India, separate schemes for sanitation were launched. Massive subsidies were provided by the Government of India (GoI) for the eradication of open defecation (OD), and this period can be referred to as “eradication of OD era”, also as the lag phase of Indian rural sanitation. Though GoI tried to subsidize the toilet construction cost, 74% rural India still follows OD as per WHO report (2006). To catch up with the MDGs, from 2008, GoI focused on the construction of toilets all over India, and 2008–2019 can be referred to as the “sanitation coverage era” which can also be called as the exponential phase of Indian rural sanitation. This review concludes that there is a need for a paradigm shift required from the construction of toilets to sustainable sanitation chain management in India.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Flooding is the most frequent, the deadliest, and the costliest natural disaster in the world. In Sudan, it causes damage more than all other hazards collectively. The impact of flooding on the population’s health is enormous. It can potentially aggravate many of the existing health risks, or even may create a new one through several processes; it increases the risk of infectious diseases directly, through contamination of drinking water, and creation of disease vector breeding sites, or indirectly, through overcrowding due to the people displacement, temporary pause in disease control activities, and related power cuts that may disrupt water treatment. The purpose of this study is to assess and analyze how the community of the study area perceives the risk of health problems during a flood situation and the effect of their perception over their attitude. This could be done by examining the local people's knowledge, awareness, and attitude, community leaders, and local government employees in the area. Through a community based descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study, qualitative and quantitative primary data were involved using a close-ended questionnaire, focus group discussion, and key informant’s interviews. The study has now provided the local authorities with a solid ground that can be relied upon to enhance risk communication with local people in the future and change their negative behaviors and attitude toward health during a flood situation.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This review attempts to explore the traditional postnatal practices based on cultural beliefs and evidence-based benefits. This narrative review involved published quantitative and qualitative studies, review papers and guidelines and review documents by the Ministry of Health Malaysia. A literature search was conducted by using these databases-Medline, Science Direct and Google Scholar. There are some evidences to support some of the postnatal practices in providing physical and psychological benefits to postpartum mothers. For example, postnatal body massage could reduce anxiety and postnatal depression. Breast massage caused a reduction in breast pain from breast engorgement and improved lactation. A hot compress could reduce breast pain and prevent postpartum weight retention. These findings are essential for healthcare providers to support or refute the traditional postnatal practices and allow better integration of traditional postnatal practices into modern medicine. More studies with good research design are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the traditional postnatal practices.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Denmark’s handling of the corona pandemic from January 2020 to May 2021 can be seen as a success story for the consensus-based model in general and for the government's handling of the crisis specifically. Yet, the crisis has also highlighted problems in the decision-making process entailing a sidelining of parliament. To this effect, the government claimed to follow expert advice from relevant public authorities, which in some instances subsequently proved to be contrary to devised policies. Oppositional contestation of government action surfaced from the first re-opening of society and onwards with right- and left-wing parties disagreeing on pace and sequence. These differences were bridged through compromises reaffirming the durability of the consensus model. While the country has conformed to its neo-corporatist legacy, a minor deviation is detected in the lacking adherence to the flexicurity model as most aid packages targeting industry resemble similar central European schemes.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The importance of the study is to demonstrate the criminal protection of personal data for individuals in general and patients in particular, and it aimed to demonstrate the adequacy of Jordanian legislation and comparing to provide legal protection of the individuals’ personal data, especially patients, in light of the Corona pandemic. The study also aims to illustrate the balance between two rights; the right of privacy for individuals’ data, especially patients infected with the Corona virus and the right of authorized parties to access this data in order to limit the spread of this virus. In order to achieve the study objectives, it discussed the nature of the concepts of privacy and personal data, and indicated the legislative treatments of the patients’ data, whether it was through the general criminal law, or through laws related to informatics, through medical charters, or even through the legislation related to the pandemic and to explain how these concepts contributed to the criminal protection of patients’ data. The study combined the analytical and comparative approach, and it concluded that the current legislation is not sufficient to protect a right worthy of legal protection, which is the right of privacy in personal data. The privacy of personal data has been exposed to many violations in the light of cyberspace, which requires legislators to hurry to issue special laws that surround personal data with a fence of criminal protection.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this present digital world, smart phones play a vital role, especially in the healthcare sector. The various mHealth applications installed in smart phones can solve primary health-related issues at a fingertip. However, the utility of those applications will increase if they meet user satisfaction and can solve the tasks effectively and efficiently. Thus, usability evaluation of mHealth applications is a matter of concern. Many usability evaluation techniques have been used till now but a majority of them are not unified and do not safeguard all usability aspects especially for mHealth applications. The purpose of this study is to recognize specific attributes that might help tremendously in assessing the usability of mHealth applications and examine the features of various usability evaluation methodologies for evaluating mHealth applications featured for diagnosing Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Bioactive components are active compounds present in small quantities in food having the ability to improve present or prevent any potential health condition. Compounds such as bioactive peptides, phytosterols, fibers, fatty acids, and vitamins have the ability to regulate various metabolic processes in human body such as free radical scavenging, inhibition or induction of gene expression, receptor activity, and enzymes. These compounds are becoming an essential ingredient for numerous food industries and food industry-based startups to come up with products that meet the increasing demand of consumer for natural, nutritious, and economical products. Natural and economical sources such as food industry waste, inedible portions of food (seeds, peels, fish head, etc.), aquacultural by-products, and secondary metabolites (microorganisms, plants, and animals) are being used for the extraction of these compounds. The exploitation of such sources contributes well to the economy and environment. Before the incorporation of these bioactive compounds into food application bioaccessibility (release of the compounds from the ingested food system into the gastrointestinal tract), bioavailability (quantity in the circulatory system after digestion and absorption) and bioactivity (physiological response of human on their reaction with other compounds) of these compounds should be taken into consideration. Encapsulation of bioactive compounds is a potential approach to stabilize their bioactivities, control their release, and increase their bioavailability. These are potential elements to replace numerous synthetic or artificial additives and dietary supplements. Still, a lot of detailed study and laboratory research need to be done to use these compounds to their full potential.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Artificial intelligence (AI)—a hi-tech technology has fascinated multiple sectors including startup businesses. At the present time, these businesses are on the upsurge in almost all the dimensions of the global economy. The majority of the businessmen and fresh graduates have been trying to establish their own business. They are transforming the world in a new and innovative way. By 2020, thousands of startups have been launched all over the world. Also, increased the job opportunities for the people, even, the government provides support to the startups, if they like the ideas and help them to grow. In India, approximately, 16,000 tech-startups have been launched. Some startups are related to artificial intelligence (AI) which are transforming an industry. From financial services algorithms and medical image processing to customer service chatbots, these startups are solving many business problems. Artificial intelligence recognized by health startups which involves ML, speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and machine vision, robotics, expert systems, and systems for scheduling, optimizing, and planning (SOP). The rapidly burgeoning artificial intelligence startup ecosystem, though, has made it necessary to keep a close eye on the emerging trends of 2020 to stay ahead of the race and tap into lucrative business opportunities. After the break of the COVID-19 pandemic, existing and emerging startups are more concentrated on the healthcare sector. Artificial intelligence tools used in healthcare have huge relevance not only in assisting doctors but also drug industries, insurance agencies, health services, patients, and medical institutions are using. The India healthcare market has been reshaped by implementing of artificial intelligence significantly. However, some socio-legality issues need to be researched upon like (i) multiple challenges faced by artificial intelligence startups in the medical sector; (ii) Indian laws regulating artificial intelligence startups in medical sectors; (iii) data privacy concerns. In this paper, researchers would discuss the nature of artificial intelligence and its definitions, Indian artificial intelligence startups in the healthcare sector, challenges faced by artificial intelligence startups, artificial intelligence startup laws and suggestions which artificial intelligence can make healthcare more efficient and affordable.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The phytoextraction with hyperaccumulator plant species has been found as a novel approach for cleaning up of arsenic (As)-contaminated soils. However, proper management strategy should be developed to enhance the phytoextraction potential of hyperaccumulator and minimize the bioavailability and As contamination to agricultural crops. A greenhouse study was evaluated to assess the effectiveness of phosphatic fertilisers viz. di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and single superphosphate (SSP) with successive two growing cycles on As removal by Chinese brake fern ( Pteris vittata L.) from the contaminated Typic Haplustepts soils of West Bengal, India. Present study evaluated the influence of phytoextraction by the fern ( P. vittata ) on redistribution of As in different fraction (water soluble, exchangeable, aluminium, iron and calcium bound) in soil as well as total and Olsen's extractable fraction in soil and its subsequent impact on rice crop. Among the five fractions, water soluble fraction and Fe-bound As was found in higher magnitude than the other As bound fractions viz. Al-bound, Ca-bound and exchangeable fraction. This fern was grown in As contaminated soils in successive two growing cycles (four months each), and the total As removal from the soil were measured. The removal values of As varied from 6.4 to 13.5% after the first growing cycle and from 10.6 to 23.9% after the second growing cycle. The phytoextracted soils were reused for rice cultivation to reveal the effect of phytoextraction on As accumulation in rice. In this enhanced process of phytoextraction by P. vittata , the phosphatic fertilizers, DAP was contributed greater than SSP in enhancing the more As uptake by the fern as confirmed by our previous study and followed by a significant decrease in available fraction of As in soil and reduced availability for accumulation in rice. Combining the process of two successive cycles phytoextraction with phosphate (DAP) management strategy leads to reduced bio-available fraction in the soil may serve better for soil with medium levels of As contamination. However, these cycles phytoextraction could be prolong with adjustable soil amendments for high As contaminated soil to attain safe limits of As in the soil and reduced the risk of rice consumption in the arsenic affected areas.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Globally, the construction industry is known for its complexity, where a multi-array of interdependent activities all take place at the same time. Construction job sites are increasingly dangerous with historically low levels of innovations and adaptation to change. Construction workers are required to perform repetitive manual tasks involving heavy lifting, bending, twisting, reaching overhead or away from the body and working under generally unfavorable conditions. Construction companies have a moral and legal responsibility to ensure working environments for their workers that do not present a threat to their health, safety and general wellbeing. The purpose of this study is to explore how the application of disruptive AI technologies could improve construction workers’ wellbeing and safety on the job site. This paper reviewed previous studies on the application of AI on construction workers’ wellbeing such as, for example, Weak AI, Strong AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Big Data. Furthermore, keywords such as, for example, Construction, Workers, Health and Safety, Artificial Intelligence and Wellbeing were used to search online databases. The findings of this study indicated that the integration of AI on construction job sites may be used to prevent negative and health and safety prejudicial occurrences from happening by monitoring and tracking the workforce and their construction activities using, for example, applications (apps), wearables or emotional wellbeing tools. Moreover, the complex industry could benefit from machine learning to bank an unlimited amount of data for better overall health and safety performance. Based on the findings, the benefits of AI technologies imbued with machine learning, have a far-reaching impact than the negatives as traditional health and safety systems continue to fail to eliminate construction accidents. Therefore, the adoption of AI could help improve construction workers wellbeing.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The article describes an Internet of Things-based military surveillance and tracking system. The system's goal is to follow every soldier's movement on the battlefield, to monitor them, and to issue either instructions or commands. The system includes a humidity sensor, a gyro sensor, a fire sensor, and a pulse sensor, among other sensors. Using a GPS module, this technology allows the control unit to track the precise location of soldiers. The present position and location of the soldier in his side are displayed on an LCD monitor. The sensor data is transferred via an Arduino module. In order to avoid the risk, the army must have a secured medium of communication, so that we can improve the defense system of the armed forces. The serial monitor is utilised in the control room to track and monitor each warrior's activity and provide essential instructions for advancements in the fighting field. They can also be used to determine who requires medical treatment, such as first aid, or immediate attention due to cannon attacks, as well as who requires additional weaponry, such as rifles, bullets, and cannons. The device not only aids in the monitoring of soldier movements, but it also facilitates communication between commanders and soldiers.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Using Osun State in Nigeria as a case study, the use of indigenous leafy vegetables in health management was investigated. An extensive literature survey was carried out to classify and detail the medicinal use of some indigenous leafy vegetables in South-Western Nigeria followed by a field survey to substantiate the result of the literature survey. A multistage sampling procedure was adopted for the fieldwork. The fieldwork consisted of the collection of ethno-botanical data through well-versed semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, and focused group discussions with key informants including farmers, shepherds, and housewives in five (5) communities. Twelve (12) vegetable species used as medicine, in addition to being eaten as vegetables and belonging to eight (8) families, were encountered in the five communities. Asteraceae had the highest number of species. Relative frequency of citation (RFC) and cultural importance index (CII) were calculated; it showed that Vernonia amygdalina holds a special place among medicinal vegetables in Osun State. The literature survey on the various indigenous leafy vegetables revealed that they have high medicinal value, and the study has given justification to the traditional uses of the plants by the indigenous communities in Osun State.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Social media promotion of prescription medicines are subject to ethical and legal standards. Contacting patients directly to promote drugs has long been frowned upon and banned in all but two countries: the United States and New Zealand. Technology has made this sensible approach obsolete. Patient’s interest in searching social media for health information is increasing rapidly, including information from drug marketers. This development was praised by many groups. The reason for this is that it offers many rewards. Social media promotion (SMP) offers well-known advantages. The purpose of this study is to assess the association of the positive aspects of SMP (such as emotional support and medical adherence) with SMP. Our results suggest that patients rate SMP very much associated with emotional support and medical adherence, which has important implications for marketers, clinicians, and policy makers who are critical in promoting the development of safe systems to improve health systems. Additionally, future studies should use an advanced communication model adapted to the social media environment to ensure thorough research.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Breast cancer is the most common cancer among US Hispanics/Latinas; however, Hispanic/Latina women in the United States have historically shown a relatively low breast cancer incidence compared to non-Hispanic White or African American/Black women. Hispanics/Latinos are genetically diverse, with varying proportions of European, Indigenous American, African, and to a lesser extent, Asian continental\\xa0genetic ancestry. This heterogeneous group has often been treated as a monolithic unit in cancer epidemiology, due to small sample sizes and the concomitant limitations in statistical power. Only a few breast cancer studies including Hispanics/Latinas have analyzed the correlation between individual genetic ancestry proportion and tumor subtype. Most of these studies were unable to provide conclusive evidence due to the reduced number of patients with available tumor subtype information (either from immunohistochemical markers or gene expression data). This chapter provides a brief description of results reported from breast cancer studies including US Hispanic/Latina or Latin American patients assessing the association/correlation between genetic ancestry and breast cancer subtype. Also discussed are possible explanations for reported findings and a perspective on how further studies could lead to more precise tumor subtype-specific risk assessment, treatment efficacy, and outcome prognosis in US Hispanics/Latinas and Latin American women.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background The study was conducted in a large NABH accredited, 2000 bedded tertiary care teaching hospital which had footfall of 2500–3000 patients every day and 300 admissions. There was a robust system for filing of the medical records, and large manpower was employed to store, retrieve, and manage the logistics of transporting records from a central location to the respective clinics or OPDs. The clinics were spread in four building. A lot of paper usage used to occur as all the clinical notes, investigations, and prescription. Most important problem among all was that doctors not comfortable with the regular electronic medical record (EMR) solutions which involves keying in of data. All these issues called for a solution that was handwritten yet digitized. Objectives Identifying and designing an EMR solution that would match the requirements vis-a-vis doing a costing study. Methodology A standard costing study was done by researchers to identify direct labor costs, equipment costs, material costs between the two options—physical records and electronic records. The end-user challenges in using electronic records were analyzed by questionnaire. A phased implementation plan of digitization in specialty outpatient departments was coordinated. Results Cost of each paper file was INR 8.57/-using 156,223 files per year costed INR 1,338,831/-. Storage space rental value equivalent was INR 21,24,000/-. Direct salary costs of 73 employees in medical record department (MRD) is INR 13,406,844/- per year. The digitization was introduced in lesser crowded departments; first, their experiences were shared to customize the product with features in other departments. Conclusion It was found to be feasible to transform the hospital from Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) level-1 digitization to HIMSS level-2 system.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The area of telemedicine, including wireless communication, has an increasingly significant impact on health care. In recent years, an increase in the importance of compression methods has been noticed in many areas of medicine. Especially in the field of storing, processing and remotely transmitting large amounts of data. Different compression algorithms, based on different methods have been described in the literature so far. Few of them are currently used in monitoring systems and telemedicine. This paper discusses the use of the Matching Pursuit (MP) compression method for electrocardiographic signal transmission using LoRa (Long Range) technology. LoRa technology is one of the communication standards of the Internet of Things. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a diagnostic tool that measures and records the heart’s electrical activity in detail. The ECG is an important tool used to diagnose heart abnormalities. The paper describes research of the effectiveness of the Matching Pursuit algorithm in compressing the ECG signal, using the Dictionary Learning. The signals from the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database were used for the tests. The analyzed signal fragments were divided into 1000 ms parts, which were then resampled and normalized. The learning data was used to create a dictionary of atoms using the Dictionary Learning method. Using the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm for the fragments of test data, indices of non-zero coefficients were obtained. In the next step, using the developed extreme compression algorithm, a byte table that could be transmitted over the network was obtained. In the research, the byte array was decompressed and the signal was reconstructed. Consequently, the transmitted to the original signal similarity was measured for different parameters of the algorithm. Thanks to the development of technology, remote patient monitoring, consulting and medical care can be more flexible and convenient.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Construction workers can be exposed to fibres, dust, and other toxic particles that can cause pneumoconiosis from silica, asbestos, and mixed dust. This systematic review aims to analyse how pneumoconiosis caused by exposure to dust contributed to the rise of occupational diseases in construction workers from 2001 to 2021. Sixteen keywords were combined to perform the search in six databases. Were included 26 articles which fulfilled all the defined inclusion criteria. A global analysis of risk disease distribution shows that exposures to mixed dust (41.1%), silica (37.5%) and asbestos (21.4%) were related to pneumoconiosis. In addition, individual analysis revealed that pneumoconiosis caused by exposure to chemical agents (silica, asbestos, and their dust) in the construction industry are predominantly related to the exposure to silica (Silicosis 38.1%), asbestos (asbestosis 33.3%, lung cancer 33.3%), and mixed dust (lung cancer 21.7%). Mixed dust seems to be the source of the highest incidence of pneumoconiosis, silica associated with silicosis is the most frequent disease.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Intelligence healthcare expert systems (HCISs) assist decision-makers diagnose accurately and treat patients’ diseases. In a pandemic, they can also, by identifying the causes of higher mortality, predict a higher number of hospitalizations in intensive care units. The theory of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), which is one of the first extensions of fuzzy sets of Zadeh, analyzes uncertain data. Uncertainty in data determines the need for the introduction of intuitionistic fuzzy HCISs (IFHCISs) for digital transformation of these processes which analyze uncertain data. The main determinant of the effectiveness of IFHCISs for diagnosing and treatment of diseases, prediction of ICU admission of patients during the pandemic and determining the main factors for higher mortality in pandemics is the optimal multicriteria system. An intuitionistic fuzzy interpretation of the classical rank correlation analyzes under the form of intercriteria analysis (ICrA) is proposed for optimizing each evaluation system of criteria in IFHCISs, based on the theories of index matrices and IFSs. The purpose of the chapter is to develop a model for successful optimization of multicriteria systems embedded in IFHCISs by expanding three-dimensional ICrA to multilayer ICrA (3-D MLICrA). The current pandemic situation raises problems about the dependence of pandemy deaths on certain factors. These problems have to process large data sets related to Covid’s mortality, some of which differ in the various reports. The effectiveness of 3-D MLICrA approach for optimizing the criteria of the IFHCIS is also demonstrated by an application on a dataset of total deaths attributed to COVID-19 and 15 key indicators of the European Union countries determining this mortality, provided by European Centre for DPC for 2021.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'There is a long history of the systematic collection and analysis of data to inform public health policy. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines public health surveillance as “ An ongoing, systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of health-related data essential to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice. ” The aim of this chapter is to identify important aspects of a coordinated approach to fire Fires safety surveillance Surveillance . If the theoretical and practical challenges identified in the chapter can be overcome and the various components of such a system put in place, it could lead to better-informed decision making and hopefully over time help to improve residential fire Residential fires safety. The material on definitions presented in this chapter is based on what has been learned when studying fatal fires Fatal fires and fire Fires deaths in Sweden. In the immediate aftermath of the fire Fires at a Halloween party in Gothenburg in 1998 where 63 teenagers died, it was decided that the central fire Fires authority should work systematically to access all data concerning fatal fires Fatal fires known to the fire Fires service, police, forensic pathologists, road accident investigators, national burn Burns centres, and the health authorities. The authors also relate to experiences gained from cooperation on fire Fire statistics Fires statistics among the Nordic countries and Estonia. The definitions used in these countries are compared with descriptions and definitions in national fire Fires statistics from Great Britain and the USA.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Covid-19 pandemic is not yet over, and its impact has affected global economic and financial sectors. This represents a challenge for Islamic finance considered as an alternative finance especially after the advent of the 2009 global financial crisis. Islamic finance certainly has an important market share in crowdfunding and also in microfinance, and its role in the financing of SMEs all over the world is not negligible, and this financial crisis should therefore pose different challenges to Islamic finance. It requires a set of instruments specific to its category, and also needs new technologies (FinTech), strategies and financial services to cope with the possible phenomenon. Our work seeks to present how Islamic finance, with its specific financing instruments, can fight against the disastrous effects of this health crisis, in particular the instruments of Zakat, funding by Qardh-Al-Hassan and fundraising like the Sukuks and finally the importance of using a set of technologies, called Fintech, to build an alternative and sustainable financial system after Covid-19. Indeed, this health crisis should present different challenges to Islamic finance, which requires FinTech, in its new strategies and its financial services. Our Paper is structured as following, we start with a review of the literature, in a second part we present the covid-19 crisis and Islamic finance, the roles of Islamic products in the face of covid-19, and in a last part, the role of artificial intelligence in islamic finance.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Healthcare service is one of the most important pillars of the existence of life on the planet. It requires frequent updates in its existing methodology; it can be in terms of resources, manpower and technology. Many researchers have proposed various types of technologies (i.e., Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT)) and ways to enhance the capabilities of the healthcare services, which also contributed in the real world scenario. However, IoHT suffers from various security and privacy-related issues. Because of them, the sensitive healthcare data may be disclosed or altered in the unauthorized way. Therefore, we need some security scheme to secure the communication of IoHT. The security issues of IoHT can be resolved by the blockchain-driven mechanisms. In this paper, we discuss the issues and challenges of blockchain-driven smart healthcare system. We also provide the details of the “generic architecture of the blockchain-driven smart healthcare system”. We then provide the practical implementation of the presented system. After that, we provide the details of various tools and technologies of the smart healthcare system. Finally, the work is finished with some concluding remarks and future research directions, which should be handled by the researchers working in the smart healthcare domain.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Mental illness and associated disorders are deep social problems that are largely ignored. Individuals with mental illnesses face many obstacles such as stigma, prejudice, and unemployment, which dissuades them from seeking help. The emergence of COVID-19 brought light to the importance of mental health. Current online patient–provider networking services act as the proverbial phone book, and finding the right provider can be a shot in the dark. There is a lack of opportunity to converse, connect or interact with providers without paying for a formal appointment. As a result, patients have a hard time finding a compatible provider. In this paper, we present details of a comprehensive journal-like patient and provider connectivity solution for the management of mental disorders. In addition to providing a platform for individuals with mental disorders to confidentially connect with medical service and insurance providers, it allows for group forums among peers. Communication and trust can be enriched with a networking application that allows patients (under an anonymous alias) and providers to freely monitor, like mention and interact with one another before initial contact. Building a privacy-focused networking platform on top of well-known communication mediums like forums and blogs can enhance communication, visibility, and understanding. Better communication, trust, and understanding lead to high-quality therapy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'With urban metro being put into service, various structure defects, such as dislocation, leakage, crack, spalling, gradually happen. Traditionally, engineers or experts are required to inspect and assess the tunnel structure on site regularly. But most of the assessment are subjective and qualitative, failing to achieve reasonable assessment and accurate tunnel maintenance operation. Therefore, some quantitative methods, such as Tunnel Servility Index (TSI), are proposed. However, TSI method only assesses the current condition of a tunnel, without considering its historical monitoring data. With the development of geotechnical engineering, large amount of monitoring data has been recorded. These data are multi-source heterogeneous, making it rather difficult to store and analyse. Database technology, especially Knowledge Graph (KG), is good at storing, managing and mining multi-source heterogeneous data. Based on KG, all data related to tunnel structure can be stored and then taken into account when making assessment; besides, the information of a tunnel from its construction to the present can be recorded in the knowledge graph. In the paper, monitoring data of Shanghai Metro Line 1 is stored in Neo4j, a graph database, to form the metro tunnel knowledge graph. Based on the KG, the metro tunnel is assessed by a dynamic assessment model based on TSI method. The hided statistic relationships among defects are also deduced. Through the application of KG on Shanghai Metro Line 1, the dynamic assessment model is proposed to be effective, reliable and advanced.',\n",

It originated and spread from Wuhan, China, in December 2019. At present, the entire world is struggling from this virus due to large confirmed positive and death cases of COVID-19. People of every nation have been isolated, and lockdowns are instituted. Despite the introduction of several precautionary measures, the spread of the virus is still increasing at an alarming pace. Although promising development has been made for the development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, no vaccines have been reported to cure the infection. Different antiviral therapies have also been attempted but do not seem to be successful for every patient. To deter the dissemination and control the spread of virus, the frontline healthcare staff and police officers deployed numerous autonomous systems for an increased line of protection. Robots are deployed to conduct different operations including decontamination, package delivery, etc. It also acts as a mediator for two-way communication between the doctors and patients. Recent advancement in robotics for its application in healthcare facilities has been found very effective for the healthcare officials to communicate with the virus affected patients, and this literature has addressed it.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'As Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) being implemented more over the years, the use of operational modal analysis of civil structures has become more significant for the assessment and evaluation of engineering structures. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have been in use for structural damage diagnostics of civil structures in the last couple of decades. While collecting vibration data from civil structures is a challenging and expensive task for both undamaged and damaged cases, in this paper, the authors are introducing Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) that is built on the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) and using Wasserstein Distance for generating artificial labelled data to be used for structural damage diagnostic purposes. The authors named the developed model “1D W-DCGAN” and successfully generated vibration data which is very similar to the input. The methodology presented in this paper will pave the way for vibration data generation for numerous future applications in the SHM domain.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Climate change has altered the pattern of rainfall, temperature, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) levels, and emission of greenhouse gases, which result in the frequency and severity of extreme events such as drought, flood, salinity, heavy metal stress, nutrient stress, new diseases, and insect pest. This significantly impacts agriculture production, food security, livelihoods, and nutrition. Worldwide, millions of people are affected due to the consequence of climate change and particularly become the most vulnerable, by increasing the frequency and virulence of extreme meteorological events that cause population displacement and reduction in agricultural productivity. A paradigm shift toward more resilient, productive, and sustainable agriculture and food systems is required. The world must act immediately act on it to put an end to hunger and malnutrition. To ensure rapid and advanced agricultural development in a short period, precision farming practices and smart breeding strategies need to follow; such as machine learning, deep learning, big data analysis, remote sensing, artificial intelligence, system biology study, genomic prediction, speed breeding, and haplotype breeding. These techniques can prove the future plants against climate variability with increased yield potential and improved resilience to achieve the goal of resilient climate agriculture.',\n",

Implementing social distancing interventions and aiming to reduce mobility are the main methods to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In this study, the case of Turkey is discussed to explore the degree of relationships among daily death, daily cases, social distancing regulations, and mobility. To accomplish this goal, data from the Ministry of Health of Turkey, Coronavirus Government Response Tracker by Blavatnik School of Management and Oxford University, and Google’s Covid-19 Community Mobility Reports between March 12 and July 29, 2020, was used. A proposed model was tested with integrated data via Partial Least Squares (PLS) Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) methodology. Our results show that daily deaths are the main driver while developing social distancing regulations. Also, social distancing interventions have a negative impact on mobility in groceries & pharmacies, transit stations, retail and recreational areas, parks, and workplaces, but a positive one on residential mobility.',\n",

They are also referred to as nutraceuticals and remain extremely nutritious. They are associated with many significant health benefits. For instance, they help in preventing nutritional deficiencies and diseases and also promote adequate growth and development. Fermented foods are foods that are made by the help of microbes under controlled growth. These foods also undergo change of certain components by enzymatic action. In the last few years, fermented foods have encountered a high in their popularity, majorly due to their well-being benefits. When considered alongside, an increase in the amount of evidence expresses the potential of inclusion of fermentation with functional foods, for the benefit of consumers, like promotion of cognitive health development.

       "  'abstract': 'A necessary step in the digitalization of our environments is to include the users in the decision loop, following a more human-centric paradigm. Such an aproach will make their interactions with surrounding technology closer to them. Therefore, there is a recurrent need in contemporary technological solutions to create proposals to assist users in a way that is not exclusive to them and makes them feel integrated into the intelligent system. In fact, this is particularly relevant when the proposed technology or system aims to nudge users to form, shape, or change their daily behaviours. In essence, solutions designed for assisting users in that matter need to consider the inclusion of humans in the learning/decision loop and still the literature in the field is scarce. In this work, we identify and address three crucial human requirements that this technology has to integrate to promote a comfortable and long-term use of technology for the effective assistance of behaviour change: trust, engagement, and adaptation. Besides, we propose a collaborative workflow based on hybrid intelligent systems to cover the lack of human requirements and needs of traditional approaches. In essence, this work aims to shed light on how to promote closer collaboration between humans and intelligent agents for behaviour change under the principle that people should not be treated as mere users of technologies and services, but their behaviour should become one of the critical levers for designing and using technologies. That is, creating a closer interaction between these technologies and people.',\n",

The domain of healthcare is particularly relevant, as it requires an enormous capacity to adapt and respond to different situations. For this, appropriate methods and tools to the complexity of these processes and systems should be applied. This study aims to identify the methods and tools that have been developed and applied in the healthcare domain within the scope of resilience engineering, as well as the scope of its application, through a systematic literature review. A review of 109 studies published between 2012 and February 2022 was carried out. We searched two academic databases, Web of Science and Scopus. Only studies in English and original peer-reviewed scientific journals that attended to inclusion criteria were included, resulting in a total of 13 publications. The results of the analysed studies showed that the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) was the method mostly used. It was also possible to verify that interviews, observations, document analysis and workshops have been used in the development of FRAM models.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Sexual pain/penetration disorders are often comorbid with recurrent/post-coital cystitis and spontaneous or provoked vestibulodynia or vulvar pain. The figures vary from 34.7–60%, Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is responsible for 85–90% of recurrent cystitis cases. Antibiotic treatment is becoming ineffective in the long term. To maximize therapeutic outcomes, a different strategy is worth considering. Common pathophysiological denominators of the three clusters of symptoms present in a patient should be identified. These include (1) predisposing factors: endocellular pathogenic biofilm of the uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), hyperactive pelvic floor, bowel problems, including irritable bowel syndrome and constipation, intestinal and vaginal dysbiosis, diabetes/familiarity with diabetes, and loss of sexual hormones after menopause; (2) precipitating factors: intercourse, constipation, and cold; and (3) maintaining factors: diagnostic omissions and minimalistic treatment approach. A targeted multimodal therapeutic strategy should then be based on accurate diagnosis. A comprehensive and skilled approach can optimize anticipation of comorbidities and offer better clinical outcomes for women, where sexual pain/penetration disorders, comorbid recurrent and/or post-coital cystitis, and vestibulodynia/vulvar pain are addressed synergistically, the sooner the better.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'More adolescents are choosing to follow plant-based diets. In this chapter we explore why young people choose to follow vegetarian diets and identify a range of vegetarian diet practices. A well-balanced vegetarian diet can provide for the nutritional needs of a growing adolescent; however, particular attention should be paid to adequate intake of protein, energy, and specific micronutrients. In strict vegans with no intake of animal products, supplementation may be required. Those with limited nutritional knowledge should seek appropriate resources to ensure dietary adequacy. We discuss how parents can support their child to meet their nutritional needs and identify when further support is warranted. Adolescents on restrictive vegetarian diets should be considered “at risk” with close monitoring and screened for eating disorders and appropriate growth and development.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In monitoring system design, the expected uncertainty of key parameters representing the structural behavior must be smaller than a target uncertainty. As a result, measurements can be used to optimally manage civil infrastructure. An important key parameter in PC-bridges control is the trend over time of structural responses, such as strain, deflection, and rotation purged from temperature effects. In fact, temperature changes cause significant responses that we must filter out to isolate distortions due to rheological effects in concrete, strand relaxation, and long-term prestress losses. We can quantify the uncertainty of temperature-compensated key parameters a posteriori, after the acquisition of data. However, in the design phase, monitoring data are not available yet; therefore, we must estimate the expected uncertainty a pre-posteriori. In this paper, we propose a logical procedure based on Bayesian inference for evaluating the pre-posterior uncertainty of long-term measurements-trend purged from temperature effects. We verify to what extent this quantity depends on: (i) measurement and model uncertainties; (ii) expected monitoring duration; (iii) sampling frequency; (iv) seasonal temperature variation. We validate our approach on a real-life case study: the Colle Isarco viaduct, a box-girder prestressed concrete bridge.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The application of Optimal Sensor Placement (OSP) algorithms has been advancing in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). Among many approaches, this study focuses on a Bayesian OSP algorithm optimized using the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) – a blackbox algorithm for continuous problems. The increase in the number of CMA-ES variants warrants the non-trivial selection problem. Nonetheless, it is difficult to say if such a step has been well-conducted in the investigated SHM literature. Hence, this study aimed to improve the existing OSP framework by adding an offline algorithm selection methodology and to demonstrate the framework’s application to buildings. Application to the ASCE benchmark structure showed that the discrete implementation of CMA-ES outperforms a discrete reformulation that used binomial sampling. OSP results were also found to agree with existing literature. Furthermore, case studies quantify that for an undamaged structure, sensor placement that is well-distributed according to the location of the columns and stiffeners gives high-quality OMA results. For damaged structures, sensors should be placed near the damaged region, and failure to do so showed a reduction of MAC value by 0.1. Lastly, with insight from industry research of the Philippine SHM landscape, these conclusions were found to be potential recommendations to improve the current developing practice compared to the international state-of-the-art.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Bulgaria’s initial response to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic was rapid and decisive. The restrictive measures—proposed and implemented by the central executive—generated little political opposition and were tolerated—if not liked—by the general public. The measures worked to limit the spread of COVID-19, and Bulgaria emerged relatively unscarred by the first wave. As the summer of 2020 approached, however, the country was lulled into complacency, most measures were relaxed, and compliance with the remaining ones dropped. All this led to a very sharp increase in the number of infections, hospitalizations and, ultimately, deaths in the autumn of 2020. A new and comprehensive lockdown was installed in November 2020, but the delayed response worked only slowly to halt the spread of the pandemic. The restrictions were gradually lifted in February 2021, but in late March they had to be re-introduced, in the midst of growing public discontent and accusations of governance chaos. Meanwhile, the country was engulfed in a political crisis. The real disaster, however, came with the vaccination campaign which progressed very slowly mainly because of a vaccine-sceptical population. Pathologically low public trust in government and authorities more generally prepared the ground for this failure.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Being a pediatrician presents challenges requiring strength of mind, body, and spirit. In this chapter we explore conceptualizations of emotional resilience and mindset in medicine, with a focus on evidence-informed practices particularly useful for physicians. To aid pediatricians in building their own effective and practical “toolkit” for emotional resilience and mindset, we describe a set of interconnected evidence-based practices whose efficacy has been documented by social scientists and mental health professionals. Building on knowledge from social, cognitive, clinical, and organizational psychology we highlight practices including mindfulness, positive psychology, dynamic mindset, self-compassion, caring connection, and relational leadership. For each concept we offer examples of practical applications in the day-to-day life of pediatricians. Our intention is to offer knowledge and tools to increase your own personal well-being and happiness. Our ultimate goal is to support a shift toward a healthier, more sustainable culture of health in the environments in which we all practice.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of medicaid expansion (ME) on receipt of palliative therapies in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients. Patients and Methods A difference-in-differences (DID) approach was used to analyze patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer identified from the National Cancer Database diagnosed during two time periods: pre-expansion (2010–2012) and post-expansion (2014–2016). Patients diagnosed while residing in ME states were compared with those in non-ME states. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of receipt of palliative therapies. Results Of 87,738 patients overall, 7483(18.1%) received palliative therapies in the pre-expansion, while 10,211(21.5%) received palliative therapies in the post-expansion period. In the pre-expansion period, treatment at a high-volume facility (HVF) (odds ratio [OR] 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02–1.18) and non-west geographic location were predictive of increased palliative therapies. In the post-expansion period, treatment at an HVF (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02–1.16), geographic location, and living in an ME state at the time of diagnosis (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.06–1.22) were predictive of increased palliative therapies. Older age, highest quartile median income (zip-code based), and treatment at a nonacademic facility were independently associated with decreased palliative therapies in both periods. DID analysis demonstrated that patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer living in ME states had increased receipt of palliative therapies relative to those in non-ME states (DID = 2.68, p < 0.001). Conclusions The overall utilization of palliative therapies in metastatic pancreatic cancer is low. Multiple sociodemographic disparities exist in the receipt of palliative therapies. ME is associated with increased receipt of palliative therapies in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Most modern seismic design codes build upon the concept of performance-based earthquake engineering that allows structures to sustain repairable damage during moderate and large earthquakes. Therefore, accurate and quantitative post-earthquake damage evaluation of real-world structures is crucial for safe operation of buildings. Structural-health monitoring provides sensor-based information regarding the structural state and informs post-earthquake building assessment. With the utilization of monitoring data, which is recorded during earthquake excitation, damage-sensitive features (DSFs) can be extracted in both purely data-driven or hybrid forms; with the latter term referring to damage indicators (DIs) that fuse data with dynamic models. In this paper, data-driven and hybrid damage identification methods are introduced and compared with respect to their performance and robustness in detecting and quantifying structural damage. The damage localization and quantification performance are discussed for varying number of building floors. Moreover, numerical models are used to enable the comparison of DSFs with metrics of nonlinearity, such as maximum drift, and with response metrics that are traditionally used to quantify damage, such as maximum inter-story drifts. Finally, uncertainties in DSFs and their sensitivity to sensor noise, prior knowledge of mass and the spectral content of earthquake excitation are assessed to explore the robustness of the hybrid DI.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has grown to improve human safety and reduce Infrastructural maintenance costs. It aims to detect, locate and quantify damage to the structure through data acquisition. However, most of the existing SHM systems face challenges performing in real-time due to environmental effects and different operational hazards. Therefore, the use of smart connected devices through the internet has provided flexibility to monitor live structures (buildings, bridge, etc.) from anywhere. These Internet of Things (IoT) devices can be linked to cloud platforms such as AWS for monitoring and analyzing the data. In this paper, a complete architecture is described to enable live monitoring applications on the AWS cloud platform. However, IoT is the network of physical devices that can send and receive data wirelessly without human intervention. IoT allows objects to be sensed and controlled remotely across the existing network infrastructure. Sensors (Accelerometers) use the Xbee protocol to transfer data to a common node (raspberry pi), then to the cloud using messaging protocols. The objective of the work demonstrates the architecture to carry out data collection, analysis, and visualization of sensor data using AWS services that result in the development of live monitoring standalone web interface.',\n",

In this context, the objective of this study was to determine the behavior of the relationship between motivation and job performance of the staff of the Regional Health Management - La Libertad during COVID-19. We use the descriptive correlational analysis with a quantitative method and cross-sectional design in the methodology. For this study, a sample of 106 workers (100%) was identified in which two types of survey instruments were used. The first is for job motivation, and the second is for job performance and its dimensions, such as cognitive, affective, and psychomotor skills. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between job motivation versus job performance and its dimensions. The results affirm a significant relationship (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) between the motivation and performance variables with their dimensions. Furthermore, it was found that there is a moderate positive correlation with Rho\\u2009=\\u20090.633.

       "  'abstract': 'Indirect bridge monitoring provides an economical procedure to ensure reliable operation of the bridges by utilizing the vehicle responses passing over the bridge. The present work proposes a unified framework for damage detection, assessment, and localization using adversarial autoencoder and wavelet transform in an unsupervised manner. Vehicle acceleration signals from healthy bridge state only are considered for adversarial autoencoder model training. Estimated reconstruction error is used as a damage detection index. Pre-processing techniques of spectrum filtering, and signal averaging are adopted to improve the model performance. Further, the locations of the detected damages are estimated by employing wavelet transform along with signal pre-processing techniques. The approach is tested on numerically simulated vehicle acceleration signals which are obtained by considering a half-car model on a simply supported bridge using finite element analysis. Different damage scenarios with varying severity at different bridge locations have been considered. It has been investigated that the proposed approach is successful in detecting damages with varying damage severity alongside locating their respective locations. The proposed approach also outperforms other unsupervised learning techniques by detecting and isolating different damages effectively.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Public health authorities attempt to delineate foodborne bacterial outbreaks by identifying connected human cases, sources of contaminated food, and contaminated food items. The analysis of whole genome sequences from causative bacterial pathogens is the most accurate way to determine if bacterial isolates are phylogenetically related and are part of the same cluster of cases. In addition to being useful to determine relationships for defining the scope of outbreaks, whole genome sequences can also be used to identify the likely geographic source of an outbreak – although for accuracy this task requires well-maintained databases of whole genome sequences from clinical, environmental, and agricultural isolates. Whole genome sequences also provide useful information on virulence and antimicrobial resistance for the purposes of risk assessment. As whole genome sequencing and bioinformatic tools and technologies continue to advance, it is likely that methods for more rapid detection and source attribution will emerge to the benefit of consumers and industry.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Plants provide vital nutrient sources throughout the planet. Plant portions that are edible and high in micro- and macronutrients are consumed as food. Aside from providing necessary nutrients for metabolic needs, it can also be used as a magical therapy for a variety of health benefits. Polyphenols, phytosterols, carotenoids, vitamins, and monoterpenes are all bioactive chemicals found in plant-based foods, each with its own chemical and biological capabilities. These are both essential and nonessential chemicals that are found in small amounts in plant products. Plant-derived compounds with protective and therapeutic qualities are also exploited in the development of medications for the treatment of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. The effectiveness of a bioactive chemical is determined by its bioavailability, bioactivity, and stability. Many processes are addressed by bioavailability of bioactive compounds, including liberation from a dietary matrix, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination phases. Various factors, such as food composition and absorption method, have a direct impact on the bioavailability of active substances during intake. The estimated initial value when they arrived in the circulatory system may differ. As a result, determining the presence of bioactive compounds in food is insufficient for determining their impact on human health. The goal of these studies is to look at various approaches for assessing bioavailability of bioactive compounds, including in vivo and in vitro models.',\n",

As a result, any given speech signal contains an abundant array of information about the speaker in terms of both the intended message, i.e., the linguistic content, and insights into particular states and traits relating to the speaker, i.e., the paralinguistic content. In the field of computational speech analysis, there are substantial and ongoing research efforts to disengage these different facets with the aim of robust and accurate recognition. Speaker states and traits of interest in such analysis include affect, depressive and mood disorders and autism spectrum conditions to name but a few.

However, the varied belief systems and worldviews held among adherents of distinct Christian traditions may interfere with practical collaborative efforts between PP and Christianity. In this chapter, we explore important considerations for effective collaboration between PP and Christianity. Namely, we argue that Christianity can provide a framework for what individuals should value and what virtues a person should pursue, whereas PP can provide the tools and methodology for how to pursue the goals that are identified by Christianity. We first review the geographic distribution and demographic composition of Christians around the world, emphasizing the value of context when working with Christian populations. Second, we highlight fundamental beliefs and values that may influence how Christians interpret and utilize empirical findings from the field of PP. Third, we discuss how Christian beliefs, traditions, and doctrines influence our understandings of well-being, health, and virtue development.

       "  'abstract': 'Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is gaining increasing attention in Italy and worldwide due to structural obsolescence and sudden collapses occurring from time to time due to insufficient maintenance or extreme events. On the other hand, the technological progress in the SHM field is making it particularly attractive as a complement to visual inspections and in-situ surveys aimed at assessing the structural safety. Accordingly, several guidelines have been developed with the aim to provide useful recommendations to technician for the design of SHM systems. Nevertheless, because of very case-specific design, so far, a general qualification procedure aimed at assessing the performance of a SHM system is still missing. On the contrary, construction products already share a thorough and well-established harmonized standardization framework since many years, and this resulted in a reliable control of performance. In this study, a preliminary qualification approach for SHM systems is proposed. The qualification scheme is scenario dependent and allows to check the effectiveness of a given SHM system defined in terms of hardware as well as software components. In order to validate the approach, different SHM systems are hypothesized and checked for possible qualification with respect to different scenarios, obtaining encouraging results. The proposed approach, therefore, represents a promising attempt towards a more exhaustive and comprehensive qualification framework for civil SHM applications.',\n",

First, the Gath-Geva fuzzy clustering method is utilized for health condition division. Second, the network model based on correlation analysis is conducted. Finally, the dynamic improved logistic model is developed to describe the changes of sensors data of aircraft engine degradation trend. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulated aircraft gas turbofan engine data is utilized for validation. The results demonstrate that our method is effective to track its degradation process of aircraft gas turbofan engine.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Background Academic burnout has adverse effects on residents' professional behavior as well as personal aspects of their lives and can ultimately affect their performance in the workplace. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of burnout among surgical residents in Imam Khomeini hospital and the relationship between factors such as sex, marital status, living place, specialized field, and anxiety with burnout. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in 2021. A validated version of the Maslach burnout inventory for students (MBI-SS), the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and a questionnaire on contributing factors were used. Statistical analysis for the prevalence of burnout and comparison between scores of groups were performed. Results Of 130 surgical residents who answered the survey, 26% met the criteria for burnout. There was a significantly higher prevalence of burnout among PGY1 residents. Of these residents, 85.4% and 62.3% had high scores on emotional exhaustion and cynicism, respectively. We observed an association between different surgical disciplines and anxiety with burnout. Conclusions The prevalence of burnout among surgical residents was notable and higher than expected. There was a reliable association between anxiety and burnout. A longitudinal study on a group of students with a consideration of associated factors is suggested.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Mobile health (mHealth) interventions can improve health outcomes by intervening in the moment of need or in the right life circumstance. mHealth interventions are now technologically feasible because current off-the-shelf mobile phones can acquire and process data in real time to deliver relevant interventions in the moment. Learning which intervention to provide in the moment, however, is an optimization problem. This book chapter describes one algorithmic approach, a “bandit algorithm,” to optimize mHealth interventions. Bandit algorithms are well-studied and are commonly used in online recommendations (e.g., Google’s ad placement, or news recommendations). Below, we walk through simulated and real-world examples to demonstrate how bandit algorithms can be used to personalize and contextualize mHealth interventions. We conclude by discussing challenges in developing bandit-based mhealth interventions.',\n",

Judaism, with its long history of texts, traditions, and practices, can substantively contribute to the developing field of positive psychology. In this chapter, we explore happiness, character, and spirituality within a Judaic framework, opening opportunities for integrative theory, research, and clinical practice. From a theoretical standpoint, these Judaic models provide useful ways of conceptualizing positive psychology constructs. On a pragmatic level, researchers and practitioners can utilize these ideas in their work with the Jewish population, enhancing their efficacy and cultural competence. The chapter includes a general description of Jewish tradition and relevant demographics for context and then summarizes the theory, research, and practice of happiness, character, and spirituality, noting practical suggestions and future directions.',\n",

Culturally appropriate childbirth care involves the care of the mother and the newborn and seeks to incorporate into its practice not only the classic characteristics of care in free position, but also a set of actions and attitudes aimed at increasing access by communities, people, and indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian nationalities to institutional childbirth care, as well as other demands from various social movements that demand humanized childbirth care. For this reason, in the present work, a sensitivity analysis was carried out on the evidence in Bayesian Networks of the elements of humanized childbirth care from the perspective of health personnel, which is useful to verify the standards of the application of culturally appropriate childbirth in areas of support decision-making for continuous improvement in childbirth care processes.',\n",

Most of our current insights on age-friendly cities Cities are from developed countries, with limited studies originating from developing countries. This study aims to explore older dwellers’ perceptions Perception and preference of transportation and mobility in relation to the age-friendly city Cities concept. Using a purposive sampling Sampling , 32 older dwellers aged 50\\xa0years and above living in Sunway City Cities , a township in Malaysia were interviewed. Participants’ viewpoints are identified after a field experiment. Qualitative results unfolded three categories namely transportation system, land pattern use and urban design as well as health status. Results demonstrate that older dwellers valued the outdoor spaces, physical infrastructure and social inclusion. Our findings provide an actionable insight for businesses, property developers, construction Construction companies and policy makers to frame and tackle some of the biggest challenges to develop an age-friendly city Cities in the developing countries.

The data had already been being collected for 7 weeks before the pandemic was announced in Poland and then during the pandemic for a period of 10\\xa0weeks. The analysis encompassed a weekly: number of steps, duration of physical activities, number of burnt kcal and number of METs. The COVID-19 epidemic resulted in a ‘dangerous’ drop in physical activity. In the first weeks of the lockdown, an average daily number of steps equalled approximately 1500.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, social media has provided a platform for sharing and discussing experiences in real time. This rich source of information may also prove useful to researchers for uncovering evolving insights into post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PACS), commonly referred to as Long COVID. In order to leverage social media data, we propose using entity-extraction methods for providing clinical insights prior to defining subsequent downstream tasks. In this work, we address the gap between state-of-the-art entity recognition models and the extraction of clinically relevant entities which may be useful to provide explanations for gaining relevant insights from Twitter data. We then propose an approach to bridge the gap by utilizing existing configurable tools, and datasets to enhance the capabilities of these models.

       "  'abstract': 'This study explored the continued applicability and relevance of Hypodermic Needle Theory, also named the Magic Bullet Theory. It used a quantitative research method using a survey tool designed to investigate a sample of citizens in Jordan in reference to their attitudes and behaviours of using both social media and traditional media during the Covid-19 pandemic. Regardless of all the criticism around the simplicity of the bullet theory and its assumption of an all-passive audience when it comes to receiving media messages, this research tests its applicability and relevance in times of pandemics and crises. The study found that Hypodermic Needle Theory remains of a much relevance to assess citizens behaviours during times of pandemics and crisis such as Covid-19. The study revealed that social media was more followed by the study sample during the pandemic to seek information. The perceived media effects were also higher for social media (M\\u2009=\\u20093.52) in comparison to traditional official media (M\\u2009=\\u20092.92). The study hypotheses shown no significant differences between males and females regarding their level of following Covid-19 topics and content which means they both follow it equally. Likewise, the study revealed no significant differences between the participants’ age, education level and place of residence in relation to their following of Covid-19 over both social media and traditional media and its effects on the participants. Therefore, this study justifies the continued relevance of the bullet theory in times of crises such as Covid-19. These results also provide a stepping-stone for future empirical research in which investigates more on the effects of the media messages on audiences taking into account the scale of both information and misinformation online in times of crises.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Typhoid fever is a global health problem, which seems neglected. Still, it is responsible for significant levels of morbidity in many regions of the world, with about 12 million cases annually, and about 600,000 fatalities. Diagnosis of typhoid poses a lot of challenges because its clinical presentation is confused with those of many other febrile infections such as malaria, yellow fever, etc. In addition, most developing countries do not have adequate bacteriology laboratories for further investigations. Decision support systems (DSSs) have been known to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the diagnosis process, in addition to improving access; however, most existing decision support models for the diagnosis of diseases have largely focused on ‘non-tropical’ conditions. An effective decision support model for the diagnosis of tropical diseases can only be developed through the engineering of experiential knowledge of physicians who are experts in the management of such conditions. In this study, we mined the experiential knowledge of twenty-five tropical disease specialist physicians to develop a decision support system based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The resulting model was tested based on 2044 patient data. Our model successfully determined the occurrence (or otherwise) of typhoid fever in 78.91% of the cases, demonstrating the utility of AHP in the diagnosis of typhoid fever.',\n",

The benefits range from improved crop productivity, high-yield producing crops to increased income for farmers. Although there is an increase in the cultivation of genetically modified crops, its use in averting food security challenges has been a major debate because of numerous concerns about food safety, impact on the environment, and socio-economic issues. The contentious debate over the benefits and concerns has threatened the implementation of the technology in so many Africa countries. The debate centers on the potential risk that could be posed to human health and environmental safety.

       "  'abstract': 'Diabetes is now one of the world’s leading chronic diseases, affecting the middle-aged and elderly in most cases. This disease will gradually transform a person into death. There is an imbalance in blood glucose with the consequence of this disease that prompts the production of lower insulin. Medical science for the treatment of this disease is now advancing steadily. In addition to this, research focused on artificial intelligence (AI) is now advancing to define the stage of diabetes so that steps can be taken by everyone. A state-of-the-art analysis of various techniques for predicting diabetes is seen in this paper. For the last decade, several techniques based on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have been focusing on diabetes prediction. This research shows a summary of the published literature on the prediction of diabetes in the last six years. A recommendation system for observing the health of a patient through a web portal is proposed at the end of this article.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The multidimensionality and interpersonal dimension of human sexuality make the study of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) a challenge. The aspiration to pursue a patient-centered, holistic approach collides with the need to establish commonly accepted diagnostic criteria for different disturbances in sexual functioning, involving one or multiple phases of the sexual response cycle and pain associated with sexual activity. According to recently proposed classifications, which are continuously evolving, the most relevant FSDs include hypoactive sexual desire disorder, female arousal disorder, persistent genital arousal disorder, and female orgasm disorder. The present chapter aims to provide a clinical perspective on these disorders by reviewing the most recent evidence on the pathophysiology, definitions, prevalence, leading etiologies, diagnostic tools, and key therapeutic approaches. Sexual pain-related conditions will be reviewed in another chapter. It is evident that a gender bias still exists, with prominent biological etiologies of FSDs being neglected and understudied at the expense of psychodynamic and relational determinants. Moreover, classifications should serve to advocate the advancement of our knowledge of female sexual functioning. This process goes through the practical translation of the updated nosology in a language that is intelligible to primary healthcare providers all over the world, and ultimately, to women.',\n",

One-size-fits-all practices fall short of inclusive education standards and can be harmful to students’ well-being and their sense of belonging.

       "  'abstract': 'In this work, the beginning of developing a structural health monitoring (SHM) approach is presented for a representation of an aircraft composite wing spar. Lack of directly available field performance data is mitigated using a high-fidelity finite element model and a probabilistic understanding of the aerodynamic loads under different flight regimes, simulating realizations of the spar’s performance in service. Debonding damage between laminates was included in the model at different locations in the spar, with various damage sizes. Under the expectation of a fiber optic measurement system being used for data collection, the target measurements are uniaxial strain, measured in several paths throughout the spar. Given measured strain, the damage assessment problem is probabilistically formulated by defining local buckling from debonding as the observable damage, which is fundamentally characterized by load-dependent buckling eigenvalues. This FE physical model is highly computationally intensive, so machine learning was used to build a “run time” surrogate model to learn the relationships between inputs – loads and damage conditions, and outputs – strain and buckling eigenvalues. In addition, other surrogate models were created to solve the inverse problem, linking strain data to damage classification (size and location). Finally, the probabilistic frameworks are demonstrated and damage criticality assessment, which is directly related to the buckling load, is performed via Gaussian process regression.',\n",

The document analysis method in this study uses the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) technique. A systematic review of 32 studies was conducted to investigate the patterns and relationships of smartphone use on adolescent well-being. The results of the study found that there are four patterns that have been identified that can affect the well-being of adolescents. The four patterns are health, social, behavioral, and educational aspects. Based on the findings of this study, it is clearly proven that there is a relationship between smartphone use and adolescent well-being. However, negative effects were found to be higher than positive ones. Therefore, the use of smartphones among adolescents should be controlled and given attention by various parties such as parents, teachers, and the government.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Covid-19 pandemic is not yet over, and its impact has affected global economic and financial sectors. This represents a challenge for Islamic finance considered as an alternative finance especially after the advent of the 2009 global financial crisis. Islamic finance certainly has an important market share in crowdfunding and also in microfinance, and its role in the financing of SMEs all over the world is not negligible, and this financial crisis should therefore pose different challenges to Islamic finance. It requires a set of instruments specific to its category, and also needs new technologies (FinTech), strategies and financial services to cope with the possible phenomenon. Our work seeks to present how Islamic finance, with its specific financing instruments, can fight against the disastrous effects of this health crisis, in particular the instruments of Zakat, funding by Qardh-Al-Hassan and fundraising like the Sukuks and finally the importance of using a set of technologies, called Fintech, to build an alternative and sustainable financial system after Covid-19. Indeed, this health crisis should present different challenges to Islamic finance, which requires FinTech, in its new strategies and its financial services. Our Paper is structured as following, we start with a review of the literature, in a second part we present the covid-19 crisis and Islamic finance, the roles of Islamic products in the face of covid-19, and in a last part, the role of artificial intelligence in islamic finance.',\n",

To effectively intervene, practitioners must understand the historical and current needs and challenges of fathers. A primary focus of this chapter is the assessment of father involvement and the quality of fathering he provides his children. This chapter then discusses the relevance of understanding fluidity—changes in the father’s status, context, and parenting situation over time rather than assuming these are stagnant factors.

       "  'abstract': 'This paper assesses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the implementation of goal 1 aspiration 1 of the African Union (AU)’s ‘Agenda 2063: the Africa We Want’ Framework. It examines how the emergence of the pandemic on the African continent and the ensuing lockdown measures implemented by most African governments, inadvertently led to job losses and financial insecurity for the people. This examination is carried out through the lens of the experiences of South Africa, Zimbabwe and Eswatini. It is asserted that the job losses and financial insecurity suffered by the people in these three countries exacerbated their plight, as these countries were already facing various socio-economic problems even before the onset of the pandemic. The paper also gives an appraisal of the AU’s response to the pandemic including its vaccination strategy and argues that in the face of an unprecedented pandemic, the AU ought to be commended for adopting a swift and proactive approach; commensurate with the anticipated scale of the problem. The paper concludes that the pandemic has laid bare the socio-economic problems faced by African problems, the very same problems which the AU sought to address through Agenda 2063.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Despite the success of data-based methods in structural health monitoring (SHM), these approaches often suffer from a lack of training data, which can be difficult to acquire for several reasons: damage-state data acquisition can be infeasible, structures may be unique and only tested in situ , sensor placement can cause issues, certain structures cannot be tested in controllable laboratory conditions and representative environmental conditions can be difficult to simulate. Training data can be simulated using physics-based models. However, this is dependent on model verification and validation (V&V), meaning assembly-level data is still required. Hierarchical V&V is a novel technique in the field of SHM. The aim of hierarchical V&V is to remove the necessity for assembly-level validation data. Instead, the process entails the V&V of subassembly-level models, which are then combined to produce an assembly-level model using dynamic substructuring (DS). This simplifies the data acquisition process in order to reduce the associated difficulties and costs. This paper focuses on the role of DS in the hierarchical V&V process for SHM. DS allows substructures to be used to create an assembly model, and for simultaneous uncertainty propagation. This allows confidence to be established in the assembled models without requiring assembly-level data.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The problem of random vibration response based robust and unsupervised damage detection for a population of composite aerostructures is addressed. The focus is on the achievement of robustness which is of paramount importance as manufacturing variability within the population and flight condition variability are practically inevitable. Two robust damage detection methods are postulated based on Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) Transmittance Function (TF) stochastic AutoRegressive with eXogenous pseudo-eXcitation (ARX) type representations for eliminating the effects of non-measurable excitation. Robustness to manufacturing variability is achieved via Multiple Model (MM) representations (the MM-TF-ARX method) or Principal Component Analysis (the PCA-TF-ARX method). The achievable detection performance is assessed via Monte Carlo ANSYS-based simulations with a population of 120 composite beams subject to manufacturing thickness variability, two distinct turbulence-like excitation profiles, and three early-stage crack damage scenarios. The results, in terms of Receiver Operating Characteristics curves, indicate excellent damage detection performance for the MM-TF-ARX method, yet inferior for its PCA-TF-ARX counterpart.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In recent years, healthcare is being challenged to deal with global aging, an increasing number of chronic patients, and growing demand for more personalized services. From this standpoint, it is comprehensible that health is longing for solutions to enhance its quality while reducing costs. In this light, the technological development brought by Industry 4.0 arises surrounded by high expectations of solving, or at least minimizing, some of the aforementioned questions. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the current state of the health revolution, named Healthcare 4.0, and follows a systematic methodology to select the documents retrieved from Web of Science and Scopus. Firstly, keywords were chosen to execute the search in the scientific databases. Then, inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to define the final sample of 130 articles. Lastly, a bibliometric analysis was performed for a better understanding of the ongoing health revolution. With the assistance of the bibliometrix R-tool, graphics and statistics were designed in order to recognize publication patterns. It was concluded that, although Healthcare 4.0 is still a recent research topic, increasing attention is being given to it. The most influential authors and countries were also detected, enabling the recognition of India as the main reference in the subject. Moreover, the relevance of IEEE journals to Healthcare 4.0 was identified, and the importance of artificial intelligence was also revealed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'One of the major threats to the information and communications technology (ICT) supply chain is the introduction of counterfeit parts and components. Global efforts have been intensified to defend against counterfeiters and counterfeit products due to their detrimental impact on the economy, safety, and security. Among the extensive literature of papers, reviews, books, and articles, this review attempts to include a detailed selection of most significant research work done in the intersection of ICT, supply chains, and counterfeits to provide a reference source for researchers. Citation network and global citation scores have been used to extract and analyze papers and discuss them in different types of clusters (electronic, medical, food, and anti-counterfeiting technologies and approaches). Our review approaches the clustered papers by focusing on (1) their contribution in documenting and modeling the intrusion of counterfeit electronic parts in the ICT supply chain, (2) the proposed counterfeits’ detection and avoidance techniques in the ICT supply chain, and (3) the contribution of ICT in thwarting counterfeits in medical, pharmaceutical, and food supply chains. This review provides a better understanding of the global efforts to address counterfeits in the ICT supply chain, as well as the role of ICT in thwarting counterfeits in other supply chains, which can guide future research to minimize the impact of counterfeits on supply chains.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Fatigue is an important issue in the durability of long-span cable-supported bridges. These structures are submitted repetitively to loads such as strong winds, varying temperatures, and increasing roadway or railway traffic. The trainload accounts for a relatively significant portion of the fatigue of critical members. Usually, trains consist of different numbers of carriages, and they cause different levels of stress. Consequently, the induced fatigue damage varies accordingly. This paper proposes an adaptive multi-category train schedule validation approach based on fatigue reliability using bridge monitoring data. The method involves three steps. Firstly, the typical train categories are identified based on long-term train weigh-in-motion (WIM) data, and their percentages are obtained. Secondly, the stress responses under each type of train are collected to establish a database, and fatigue damage is calculated to generate the probability density distribution. Thirdly, the number of different types of trains can be obtained for a typical train daily schedule, and the fatigue damage is calculated and checked with the design fatigue life. The case study of a suspension bridge is used to verify the approach, and conclusions are drawn from the perspective of the bridge management.',\n",

This study evaluated the exposure to different particulate matter (PM) fractions and characterized thermal comfort parameters in three fitness centers (FCs) located in shopping malls. PM was continuously (n\\u2009=\\u2009216,000) monitored for 34\\xa0days in three FCs situated in urban-background and urban-traffic zones of Porto Metropolitan Area, Portugal. Human occupancy and the respective activities increase indoor PM in all FCs; when occupied PM levels were 1.3–10 times higher than when places were without people. PM 0.3–2.5 composed the majority of indoor PM (46–64%), but outdoor infiltrations lead to a higher proportion of coarse fractions (~54% of the total PM). Finally, PM 10 means exceeded the Portuguese protection threshold, whereas comfort parameters were generally within the indicated guidelines. Elevated levels of PM 10 in studied environments may promote possible risks for the respective occupants, both professionals, and exercisers.',\n",

This was done by studying the performance of three well-known classification algorithms Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree-J48 (J48), to predict the probability of heart attack. The performance of the algorithms for accuracy was evaluated using the Healthcare (heart attack possibility) dataset, freely available on kagle. The data was divided into three categories consisting of (303, 909, 1808) instances which were analyzed on the WEKA platform. The results showed that the RFC was the best performer.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Fathers are integral to family processes and children’s well-being. However, major social and economic changes in the United States over the last several decades have had profound impacts on the economic and social well-being of men of lower socioeconomic status (SES) and men of color, specifically Black, Latino, and Indigenous men. These changes have created stark disparities in the ability and capacity of fathers to be involved with their children. Social policies can be effective mechanisms for promoting and ensuring the well-being of fathers, but fathers are rarely the explicit target of policy efforts. Child support enforcement, the only national policy targeting fathers, has produced an inequitable system that disproportionately subjects low-SES fathers and fathers of color to a series of punitive enforcement mechanisms with minimal benefit to children. We provide evidence for the potential of a broad swath of social policies that have not traditionally been targeted at fathers to improve the well-being of fathers and facilitate their engagement with children. We propose that social workers are uniquely positioned to advocate for reforms and expansions to these policies that will improve father, child, and family well-being and promote economic, social, and racial justice.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Telework has progressively increased in the past decades, providing organizations and, consequently, leaders, with new challenges. The COVID19 pandemic not only doubled the number of teleworkers, but reinforced these challenges, by forcing some organizations and employees to abruptly adapt to this new reality. In this manuscript, we aimed to explore the role of the strategies implemented by leaders to manage their teams in employees’ sense of professional isolation, burnout, and perceived performance. Thus, data was collected from 1149 teleworkers during the COVID19 pandemic, who answered an online questionnaire. At that time, 79% were working exclusively from home, and 91% had never had a previous experience of working remotely. The results showed that the strategies implemented by leaders to manage their teams contributed to reduce employees’ sense of professional isolation which, in turn, is associated with lower feelings of burnout and higher perceptions of performance. The study reinforced the role of leadership in the context of teleworking and, specifically, the importance of leaders being attentive to team members’ specific needs in order to help improving their wellbeing.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The guided wave (GW) based structural health monitoring method has been a promising method because this method can cover a wide monitoring range and it is sensitive to small damage. However, online damage quantification is difficult as damage initiation and growth are affected by various uncertainties. In addition, various time-varying conditions introduce uncertainty effects on GW features, resulting in a decrease in the accuracy of damage quantification. Therefore, a multi-source feature fusion Gaussian mixture model (MSFF-GMM) is proposed to improve the accuracy of damage quantification. Firstly, MSFF-GMM is constructed by fusing the feature information from multiple channels and multiple specimens under time-varying conditions. Then, the migration index calculated by Kullback-Leibler divergence is used to measure the difference between the GMMs constructed at different damage degrees. Finally, the proposed method is validated for online damage quantification on the typical aircraft lug structure under time-varying dynamic load conditions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Throughout the history of psychology, scholars and practitioners have sought to understand religious/spiritual (R/S) development and its intersections with well-being. Several models of R/S development have been proposed, but they have neither been well-integrated with each other nor studied and applied broadly in the field of positive psychology. This chapter’s purpose is to draw on existing longitudinal research on R/S development to propose an integrative theory that can guide developmental science and practice on religion, spirituality, and positive psychology. This Positive Religious and Spiritual Development (PRSD) theory posits that people’s religiousness/spirituality (a) is motivated by goals designed to meet psychological needs (e.g., for acceptance, predictability, and competence); (b) consists of mental/neural representations (stored beliefs, emotions, action tendencies, and physiological responses) and R/S habits that develop and change through relational experiences at the micro-, meso-, and macrolevels; (c) is influenced by numerous contextual factors (e.g., age, sex/gender, culture, and faith tradition), including personal and sociocultural assets and liabilities (risk and resilience factors); and (d) interacts bidirectionally with people’s holistic well-being via psychological, social, behavioral, and physical pathways. We offer illustrative examples of PRSD theory, highlight some of its caveats and limitations, and discuss its applications for clinical practice and religious ministry.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Protein-energy malnutrition is a state of disordered catabolism resulting from metabolic derangements or starvation. It is associated with chronic disease, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, serious infections, and even an increased prevalence of morbidity and mortality in countries with poor socioeconomic or environmental factors. Adequate food administration is essential to satisfy the main caloric and nutritional demands of humans. The most significant factors seen in the development of protein-energy malnutrition in areas of high incidence, such as underdeveloped countries, are inadequate food and nutrient supplies. It has been well established that one of the strategies to alleviate undernourishment is the biofortification of staple crops. This is because vegetables and plants are significant sources of crucial nutrients for human growth and development. To enhance plant nutrition, recent tactics aim to formulated balanced and diverse diets with acceptable levels of\\xa0vitamins and minerals that benefit human health. New advances in plant biotechnology and animal productivity could control key enzymes in several metabolic pathways, enriching important nutrients such as iron and vitamins and decreasing the content of disadvantageous compounds such as acrylamide-forming amino acids and phytic acids. Numerous biofortified crops such as rice, maize, and wheat have been created to resolve the problem of nutrition deficiencies. Some examples of these methodologies are genome editing engineered nucleases, transcriptional activator-like effector nucleases, zinc finger nucleases, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and associated Cas9 endonuclease which have been created and widely studied for their application, efficiency, and specificity.',\n",

The main goal of the current study is to develop guidelines in order to define the requirements and externalities of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) from the Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS) perspective. A literature review was carried out to understand the main concepts applied and semi-structured interviews were applied to five active Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) technicians. It was concluded that companies aren’t prepared to face the challenges posed by I4.0 through an OHSMS and ISO 45001:2018 doesn’t contemplate the new industrial revolution yet. The main difficulties highlighted by the companies were the extensive legislation that doesn’t follow the industrial developments, the high capital required for the initial investment, the difficult access to know-how and the impact that this will have on production.',\n",

Here the design and implementation of an effective outreach communication for social mobilization based on substantial ‘reversal of learning’ is expected to lead toward more responsive, potent and sustainable governance. We are witnessing a progressive global interest in the domain and much of so in India.

       "  'abstract': 'The demand for food is increasing every day because of the growing population. However, the proportional growth in the production of crops is not happening. This problem can be addressed using information technology in the agricultural process. In this paper, an Internet of Things-based (IoT) system has been designed and developed to monitor soil health. The chemical and physical properties of the soil can be evaluated by measuring different parameters contained in the soil such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, moisture, and salinity as well as electrical conductivity. Three sensor nodes are developed using NodeMCU ESP8266, NPK sensor, EC sensor, soil moisture, and temperature sensor. First, the data obtained from the procured sensors have been tested and validated in the laboratory by adding different amounts of urea and water. These sensor nodes, which are powered by solar, are placed at some desired location in the agricultural fields to collect the soil data. All the sensor data are then sent to the cloud over a Wi-Fi network using Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol for monitoring, further analysis, and decision-making. The data of the soil parameters are stored in a cloud platform, which will allow monitoring of the data in graphical and numerical formats. An android application is developed for real-time monitoring of the data.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'An estimated 34,800 cancers in the United States were caused by HPV between 2012 and 2016. Among those cancers (cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, oropharyngeal, and penile), the overwhelming majority can be prevented with vaccination and cervical cancer screening and treatment. While the incidence of cervical cancer has significantly declined in all populations in the United States since 1975, Hispanic women continue to have significantly higher rates of cervical cancer than non-Hispanic White and Black women. In 2018, the director of the WHO announced his call to action for the global elimination of cervical cancer which is defined as an incidence of <4/100,000. Mathematical models indicate that the United States can achieve the goal of cervical cancer elimination (reducing incidence from ~7/100,000 to <4/100,000) by 2030 if we meet the goals set for the country for both vaccination and screening/treatment. The fastest way to achieve the goal is to ensure that all age-eligible women follow cervical cancer screening guidelines, which are for 93% of females to be screened for cervical cancer. Currently only 80% of women follow this recommendation, with lower percentages among Hispanic women (70–78%). Of concern, the percentage of women following screening recommendations appears to be on the decline in the United States. While the rate of HPV vaccination coverage is far below the national goal of 80%, overall Hispanic adolescents have higher vaccine coverage (56.6%) compared to non-Hispanic White (47.8%) and Black (53.3%) adolescents. There is a need to communicate the HPV vaccine’s effectiveness to increase its acceptance, and there is also an ongoing need to promote cervical cancer screening. In addition, providers must consistently deliver strong and linguistically/culturally relevant recommendations for both vaccination and screening.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the recent times, there has been a growing concern to improve safety management practices in the construction sector. In this regard, there is a need to improve “safety culture” as it plays a significant role in improving workplace safety conditions and is viewed as a comprehensive construct having possibilities of interventions at all levels of construction projects. However, the growing body of knowledge on safety culture research makes it difficult to have a systematic and comprehensive view of the subject. Towards addressing this issue, there is a need to systematize this body of knowledge with a comprehensive systematic literature review. The review is based on three-step methodology. First step aims at gathering suitable articles related to safety culture in construction sector. The second step presents the results of descriptive analysis on recent trends in safety culture research. Last step focuses on a detailed systematic review pertaining to definition, factors, and assessment tools that influence the level of safety culture practices. Results of this review help to uncover and provide a comprehensive overview of recent trends and advances governing safety culture research, and it can help academicians and practitioners identify fundamental influence from these published articles. Implications of the study emphasized that the study outcomes can assist researchers and practitioners to have consensus on industry-specific standards. Furthermore, this systematic literature review has helped to conceptualize safety culture, thereby highlighting the impact of external events and stakeholders interests in construction sector.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The food and beverage industry of India has seen an escalating growth in the last few years. Nutraceuticals and functional food sector are evolving as a popular segment owing to the increasing awareness of the people towards good health. Another driver for its growth is the factors like unhealthy lifestyle, less exercise, and workouts, which make the dependence on nutraceuticals and functional foods inevitable. It is claimed by many that the Indian nutraceuticals and functional food market are yet to experience the exponential growth. This exaggerates the need and importance of the regulations specific to the nutraceuticals and functional foods. Historically, in India, the food laws were highly ambiguous and the regulations related to this segment were at the back seat, but with the introduction of Food Safety Standards (FSS) Act, 2006, a special emphasis is being given to the regulations of nutraceuticals and functional foods. The nutraceuticals and functional foods that are imported into India also need compliance with the Food Safety Standards (FSS) Act and its rules and regulations. Although the FSS Act 2006 is reforming in terms of compliance and ease to the operators, there still is the need of significant expansion of this act, in order to increase the impact of this law in the whole functional food and nutraceutical industry of India.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Stigma and discrimination regarding dementia are still very impactful on the experience of having dementia and of being a carer. To tackle this issue and uplift the quality of life of people with dementia and their carers, efforts are being made to push forward a change in the societal perception of dementia. These include raising awareness and promoting inclusive initiatives that conjointly involve people with dementia and their carers, such as engaging in meaningful activities. Meaningful activities have a crucial role in enhancing the well-being of people with dementia as a means for participation, connection with others, self-expression, and control. This position paper calls attention to the need for improving the design of information so that it is tailored to people with dementia and supports their self-determination, individuality and autonomy, and the feeling of living a meaningful life. Although there is plenty of information about dementia, often this is not targeted to people with dementia, nor designed in a way that facilitates their access and understanding. This is an opportunity for design practice and research to contribute. This position is driven by person-centred, rights-based and participatory design approaches and is anchored in the authors’ previous research on co-designing with people with dementia and their families to support their engagement in meaningful activities.',\n",

An Emergency Situation was announced, “stay-at-home” instructions followed, and the first wave of the pandemic passed with few infections and hospitalizations. This first lockdown phase was marked by a high degree of elite unity and public collaboration as the country attempted to come to terms with the initial confusion and uncertainty caused by the pandemic. However, a long second-wave that began in the early autumn and stretched through a long winter and into the early spring of 2021 heightened public discontent and the unity of the first phase disappeared as Latvia returned to a socially distanced politics as normal of feuding politicians, fragmenting government coalitions and a disenchanted, hostile public. Government institutions quickly adapted to the pandemic. In the early stages of the pandemic the prime minister, finance minister and health minister led the decision-making process, but this was gradually enlarged to the cabinet of ministers as a whole and then to a broader group of experts and academics. Existing patterns of governance continued for normal, non-pandemic policymaking, with continuing political conflicts among the members of the government coalition and between the government and mainstream opposition.

       "  'abstract': 'Measuring the electrical impedance of piezoelectric transducers is an important step in structural health monitoring (SHM) systems with damage detection based on the electromechanical impedance (EMI) technique. Studies reported in the literature usually analyze the performance of commercial and alternative measurement systems at low frequency. However, the excitation of the transducer with a high frequency, typically above 1\\xa0MHz, allows the detection of incipient damage, making it necessary to analyze measurement systems at high frequencies. As it is an analysis region still little explored for the EMI technique, it is necessary to analyze the repeatability of measurements, since the variation of the structural condition is given by the application of damage indices that quantify the differences between impedance signatures obtained before and after the damage incidence. Therefore, experimental tests were carried out using a piezoelectric diaphragm coupled to an aluminum structure, in order to verify the accuracy of measurements by varying the duration and amplitude of the excitation signals of a measurement system that uses sinusoidal signals. The results indicate that the variation of these parameters directly interferes with the precision of the measurements and the impedance signatures, enabling more reliable analyzes to be obtained about the structural condition.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Research shows that children separated from parents face adverse social, psychological, health, and economic outcomes. Most children in child welfare systems are not parentless, but rather separated from their parents. Understanding who is labeled as an orphan is important; this labeling tends to dictate the type of services a child may receive. Children lose or become separated from their parents for many, often overlapping reasons. Perhaps the most common reason for parental separation globally is poverty – poverty harms and destabilizes families and communities overall, creating orphans among other ill effects. Other causes of orphanhood may include substance abuse, other diseases, natural disasters, son preference, single motherhood stigmatization, wars and violence, parental migration, and discriminatory disability policies. Children may also be victims of fraud, trafficking, and/or kidnapping. Countries have responded to orphanhood in a variety of ways. Generally responses centered around family preservation are considered most optimal. Other responses include foster care, group homes, and orphanages. When families cannot be reunited, adoptions are sometimes carried out. A broad understanding of the issues of orphanhood may equip educational, medical, social work, and psychological professionals as well as (potential adoptive) parents and volunteers to act in ways that align with orphan’s best interests in particular circumstances.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Aims/hypothesis Genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes is well-established, and genetic risk scores (GRS) have been developed that capture heritable liabilities for type 2 diabetes phenotypes. However, the proteins through which these genetic variants influence risk have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to identify proteins and pathways through which type 2 diabetes risk variants may influence pathophysiology. Methods Using a proteomics data-driven approach in a discovery sample of 7241 White participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) cohort and a replication sample of 1674 Black ARIC participants, we interrogated plasma levels of 4870 proteins and four GRS of specific type 2 diabetes phenotypes related to beta cell function, insulin resistance, lipodystrophy, BMI/blood lipid abnormalities and a composite score of all variants combined. Results Twenty-two plasma proteins were identified in White participants after Bonferroni correction. Of the 22 protein–GRS associations that were statistically significant, 10 were replicated in Black participants and all but one were directionally consistent. In a secondary analysis, 18 of the 22 proteins were found to be associated with prevalent type 2 diabetes and ten proteins were associated with incident type 2 diabetes. Two-sample Mendelian randomisation indicated that complement C2 may be causally related to greater type 2 diabetes risk (inverse variance weighted estimate: OR 1.65 per SD; p =7.0 × 10 −3 ), while neuropilin-2 was inversely associated (OR 0.44 per SD; p =8.0 × 10 −3 ). Conclusions/interpretation Identified proteins may represent viable intervention or pharmacological targets to prevent, reverse or slow type 2 diabetes progression, and further research is needed to pursue these targets.

       "  'abstract': 'Adolescents in the United States are exposed to unrealistic body shapes and dieting culture from a young age. Dieting can include a wide range of behaviors: dietary restriction; use of supplements or meal replacement products rather than real foods; fasting; taking diet pills or laxatives; or self-induced vomiting. A variety of factors influence an adolescent’s body image and dieting behaviors, including biological and developmental changes; familial and peer influence; and larger societal impact from cultural norms and mass media. Concerns about appearance are common among adolescents as their bodies are going through physical changes. Parental influence plays a significant role in forming adolescents’ eating habits and perspectives on dieting and nutrition. Peer comparison is one of the biggest influences of an adolescent’s opinion of their appearance and development of nutritional and exercise patterns. Adolescents may engage in unsafe eating behaviors in an attempt to achieve an unrealistic standard of attractiveness promoted by the mass media.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background Body composition has been associated with arterial stiffness as a marker of cardiovascular risk. The association between shift work and cardiovascular diseases is well known. Objectives To analyze the relationship between anthropometric parameters, body composition parameters obtained by bioimpedance, and arterial stiffness, in a sample of shift workers. Materials and Methods The study included 28 participants (14 shift group and 14 control group), equal from both genders, with a mean age of 34.7\\u2009±\\u200910.2\\xa0years, from a private company. Anthropometric measurements included waist and hip circumference, waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), and body mass index (BMI). Parameters derived from bioimpedance included body fat percentage (%BF), lean mass (LM, kg), bone mass (BM, kg), and visceral fat. Arterial Stiffness was measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV), estimated by oscillometry, using the Mobil-O-Graph device. Results No association was found between body composition and arterial stiffness in the studied sample. A moderate to high correlation was seen between blood pressure (BP) and all anthropometric parameters. Conclusions The present study did not confirm a positive association between shift work and an higher cardiovascular risk.',\n",

It is imperative that humanitarian workers attend to all of these areas in order to practice most effectively and ethically; however, it is likely that social workers’ training on practitioner-focused topics varies significantly. This chapter explores several key influential factors of social work practice with survivors of persecution and forced displacement by considering impacts of practice contexts and conditions, practitioners’ professional identities, lived experiences of social workers, and organizations’ responsibilities to their staff.

Using the new pattern innovations in the healthcare area could offer other option courses in dealing with the patients' healthiness records and furthermore improve the health quality. Researchers are looking for permanent and easy ways for monitoring patient’s records remotely by means of a patient monitor system. The utilization of the Internet of Things (IoT) is one of these methods where remote patient monitoring by healthcare providers is possible. However, issues in privacy and security have arisen due to the rise in the number of IoT devices. Discloser of patient data is another privacy issue. In various studies, it was presented that blockchain technology is a trustworthy network that ensures the privacy and security issues of patient information transferred through IoT devices. Subsequently, this segment traces the IoT advancement in the healthcare segment as a rising exploration and beneficial trend these days.

       "  'abstract': 'The structural health monitoring and assessment tasks of civil infrastructures e.g. bridges, railway tracks are inevitable in order to keep the transportation network active for smooth operation. And due to the complex inherent traits of the aforementioned infrastructures, it requires appropriate strategies to keep them functional. The conventional monitoring approaches (e.g. manual) are becoming unpopular as a result of the advancement of the sensors-based monitoring. Based on the measured data, long-term monitoring is possible regardless the existence of a prior model, though it may not be so straightforward task if a prior model is missing. Therefore, to avail the advantages of the state-of-the-art tools, this study focuses into the possibility of data-based modelling by adopting sub-space method. To do this end, two different experimentally measured sets of data of (i) a laboratory scaled bridge, and (ii) a rail-track’s data have been used to perform analyses. Initially, the performance of the developed models are evaluated and later the models have been validated. The pilot outcome shows the efficacy of the developed model in terms of prediction capability to the measured data. Further, the model has been utilized to forecast future behaviour that will assist the assessment of the unseen future behaviour of the infrastructures.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'During the last years, paradigms like crowdsensing arose in the context of mobile technologies promising to support researchers in life sciences and healthcare with new opportunities. By the use of smartphones, data can be gathered in everyday life and easily compared to other users of the crowd, especially when taking environmental factors or sensor data into account as well. In the context of chronic diseases, mobile technology can particularly help to empower patients in coping with their individual health situation more properly. However, the utilization of mobile technology for healthcare purposes is still challenging, the current Covid-19 pandemic reveals it dramatically. Following this, the work at hand discusses two important and relevant aspects for mobile crowdsensing in healthcare scenarios. First, the status quo of the latter setting is discussed. Second, salient aspects are presented, which can help researchers to conceptualize mobile crowdsensing to a more generic software toolbox that is able to utilize data gathered with smartphones and their built-in sensors in everyday life. The overall goal of such toolbox constitutes the support of researchers in conducting mobile-supported studies as well as the proper analysis of this new kind of data source. On top of this, patients shall be empowered to demystify their individual health condition more properly when using the toolbox, especially by exploiting the wisdom of the crowd.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'During the first phases of the pandemic, multiple Member States have introduced restrictions to human mobility in an uncoordinated fashion. Thereby, some of the most tangible achievements of supranational integration were called into question, including the abolition of internal border controls in the Schengen area and free movement of workers and EU citizens. Against this background, EU institutions and Member States have put into practice a crisis response that may be described as coordinative Europeanization. On the one hand, this approach preserves Member States’ wide latitude to adopt measures for the purpose of safeguarding public health. On the other hand, it establishes an intense mode of coordination among national decision-makers, which has contributed to the streamlining and gradual reduction of border closures and travel restrictions in practice. While this crisis response may thus be viewed as a success, it did not preclude the resumption of uncoordinated measures in the light of new variants of the virus. Thus, the question may be raised whether such a crisis response may merely resemble a fair-weather arrangement. The present contribution will answer in the negative, focussing especially on the discursive impact that coordinative Europeanization generates for national decision-makers. In this respect, it is argued that, despite relatively weak legal instructions, coordinative Europeanization has motivated national decision-makers to duly consider the supranational implications of their actions, even in the context of relative uncertainty surrounding new variants of Covid-19.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Airport business has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with travel ban, closed borders and the “new norm” of some standard operating procedures. The implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on airports have driven the adoption of technology that offers value for optimising operations as an approach to airports reopening within the new norm. The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility of technology adoption in assisting airport industry on the road to recovery following the COVID-19 crisis. It investigates the adoption of technology by airports and its benefits in assisting airports reopening and operations recovery. For this study, a total of 33 literatures on technology adoption by airports between the year of 2020 to 2021 were reviewed. The findings indicated that airports will benefit from adopting three major areas of technology: Artificial Intelligence, biometrics, and the Internet of Things. These technologies benefit airports in a variety of ways such as cost-effectiveness, crowd control, improved efficiency, enhanced passenger experience, reduced contact, improved safety and security, time savings, and assistance for airport workers. Technological adoption in airport operations, on the road to recovery following the COVID-19 crisis, can contribute to the overall perception and distinctiveness of airports, as well as the acceptance of technology.',\n",

It also presents a proposed design for a wearable sensor that firefighters can use. This review is based on articles that reference the use of wearable sensors on an occupational level and the development of those systems. The studies show few wearable sensors used in high-intensity activities, although many can be used in other environments.

Blockchain technology provides protected, shared, and decentralized ledger that aids communication and exchange of information in a peer-to-peer network, where broadcasted verdicts are decided through the participant rather than a solitary authority. This study examines the blockchain structure to develop a decentralized and secured healthcare system.

However, the integration of linear electromechanical actuators is challenging in safety critical systems due to jamming of the driven load. That fault is critical in many applications such as primary flight controls or landing gears extension and steering. This paper reviews solutions currently available for aerospace application, limits for their effective deployment and possible solutions to achieve a condition-based maintenance to reduce costs still guaranteeing safety. Typical conversion mechanisms adopted so far are described along with the failure modes of these systems, contrasting their many advantages. Particular attention is given to the jamming and possible strategies to avoid it. In particular, any structural alteration which can induce jamming can be monitored as prescribed by predictive maintenance approach in order to detect upcoming faults in advance. Among different possibilities available to timely assess latent fault inducing jamming, the analysis of electrical current and/or mechanical vibrations signals by deterministic or statistic approaches are the most promising. In addition they show strong potentialities in implementing data fusion and learning algorithms to identify different EMA operational conditions.',\n",

As the world health organization adduced, technological proceeds in cardiac function assessment have become the nucleus and heart of all leading research studies on CVDs. Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is the most functional and convenient tool used to test the range of heart-related irregularities. Most of the approaches present in the literature on ECG signal analysis consider noise removal, rhythm-based analysis, and heartbeat detection to improve the performance of a cardiac pacemaker. Advancements in ECG segment detection and beat classification have a limited evaluation and still require clinical approvals. This chapter discusses approaches\\xa0and techniques to implement an on-chip ECG detector for a cardiac pacemaker system. Moreover, different challenges regarding the ECG signal morphology analysis deriving from the medical literature are extensively reviewed.',\n",

Following an overview of autoethnography and its influence on our research methods used in collecting data for this chapter, specific aspects of correctional facility design examined in this chapter include prison cells, toilets in cells, visitation and communication spaces, building materials, lighting, and colour schemes of prison walls, lack of windows in prison, exterior appearance of the facility, and geographic location of the prison.

       "  'abstract': 'Informal vendors are a critical source of food security for urban residents in African cities. However, the livelihoods of these traders, and the governance constraints they encounter, are not well-understood outside of the region’s capital and primate cities. This study focuses on two distinct secondary cities in Nigeria, Calabar in the South-South geopolitical zone of the country and Minna in the Middle Belt region. Interviews were collected with local and state officials in each city on the legal, institutional, and oversight functions they provide within the informal food sector. This was complemented with a survey of approximately 1097 traders across the two cities to assess their demographic profile, contributions to food security, key challenges they face for profitability, engagement with government actors, and degree of access to services in the markets. The analysis highlights two main findings. First, informal traders report less harassment by government actors than has been observed in larger Nigerian cities. At the same time, however, the enabling environment is characterized by benign neglect whereby government-mandated oversight functions are not comprehensively implemented and service delivery gaps remain a major hindrance to food safety. Second, there are important differences in the needs of traders across cities, suggesting that policies focused on food safety and improving the livelihoods of this constituency more broadly need to be properly nuanced even at the subnational level.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Nowadays, the majority of people spend their lot of time indoors as compared to outdoors. In recent times, indoor air quality is poor or even worse than outdoor air quality. Some reasons for this bad air quality are the use of cleaning chemicals (releases volatile organic compounds), microbial flora, and the circulation of the same polluted air, especially for kitchens. To lessen the effects of indoor air pollutants on health and the environment, there is a need for developing rapid, cost-effective, and sensitive technology to detect these pollutants and helps with remediation. Biosensors proved themselves ideal to overcome the problem of indoor air pollution as these provide real-time data and simple to use. The biosensors are devices containing biological elements that can be enzyme, antibody, or microorganism; this biological element helps in the recognition of the pollutant present in the environment. This paper provides a review of the current status of various types of biosensors developed for indoor air pollution with the future outlook of biosensor technology.',\n",

In industries, it is generally feasible to obtain both prior mechanical system degradation knowledge and condition monitoring data, and the effective fusion of them would output more satisfactory RUL prediction results. Motivated by this superiority, this chapter first elaborates the basic framework of data-model fusion RUL prediction methods, and introduces four types of internal and external variabilities of mechanical system that substantially influence the RUL prediction accuracy, i.e., random fluctuation variability, unit-to-unit variability, time-varying operational conditions, and competing failure processes. Then, modeling methodologies are developed with respect to different types of variabilities, and corresponding algorithms are designed to fulfill the RUL prediction task. Finally, experimental analyses on various types of mechanical systems are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the introduced methods in practical cases.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The face masks are one of the best tools to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although these could stop being used in a future, there are plenty of application where their use is needed. For this reason, their study in terms of health effects and speech intelligibility and articulation index could be interesting. In this research, a survey was carried out to know the effect of wearing face mask in different education levels. Besides, a study of the speech intelligibility, articulation index and sound quality evaluations were carried out to research which type of the face mask should be used in education settings. The results suggest that there is a correlation between the health effects due to the use of the face mask and the gender or the type of contract. Additionally, there are significant differences in terms of speech intelligibility, articulation index and loudness depending on the type of face mask used, the distance between students and teachers and if the students have hearing-impaired. Thus, this paper can provide a guidance on how to choose the best face mask to improve speech understanding when communicating with other people, especially in education settings.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Composite structures have been increasingly adopted for designing high performance airframes. However, the critical fracture mechanics prevents a smooth integration of composites in safety designed aircraft. Some compensation strategies are needed to face the occurrence of barely visible damage, including interply delamination and disbonding of stringers adopted to stiffen the airframe. The latter evidences the necessity of crack stoppers in form of rivets or similar connections between the skin and the stringer although composite allow one-piece manufacturing. This brings to light the necessity of crack identification, localization and size estimation to achieve the stringer monitoring and make use of less connections possible. To this end, a novel and promising approach based on guided wave propagation and scattering in composite media is investigated thoroughly using finite element modeling. Firstly, the potentiality of this approach is highlighted making use of a design formulation applied to a linear sensor network located alongside the stringer. Secondly, the interaction between the wave and the stringer is further investigated to achieve simultaneous inspections by an asymmetric design of the sensor network. Theoretical findings demonstrate the ability of guided waves to achieve a local monitoring of the structural performance. The wave focusing can be achieved by locating the sensors appropriately. Numerical outcomes show how a good level of inspection can be achieved making use of fewer sensors possible.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The first COVID-19 case in the Special Region of Yogyakarta (SRY), Indonesia, was reported in March 2020. When the case surge peaked, SRY was also exposed to effusive Merapi eruption (during which lava domes were formed on the southwest flank and inside the crater) accompanied by several pyroclastic flows and rockfalls. The research sought to evaluate disaster management practices during the eruption’s emergency response phase amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in the SRY. The primary data on the mechanism by which the disaster management was conducted were obtained from in-depth interviews with the key informant from the Local Disaster Management Agency (BPBD of SRY and Sleman District) and the Disaster Risk Reduction Platform (FPRB of SRY). They included ancillary data such as the number of vulnerable groups, susceptibility, and disaster risk from the National Disaster Management Agency. The research argued that several disaster management practices had been implemented during the emergency response phase that cooccurred with the COVID-19 pandemic, including modifying evacuation shelters to meet the requirements of the public health measures and planning the “sister village” and “sister school” system. In addition, all parties were actively involved in drafting and implementing new rules and regulations under the authority of the central and provincial governments. The critical question arising from the praxis is how strictly the health protocols had been enforced in the research area since the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increased.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The various types of welding workstation designs used in a rail component manufacturing system environment have drawn the attention of industrial engineers to the safety and efficiency of the workers during welding operations. Welding operations are carried out using several posture configurations, which have a negative physical ergonomic impact on the workers, especially in manual welding processes. This empirical research investigates the ergonomics conditions of welding workplaces with the aim of ascertaining the disorders that may be associated with working posture during welding operations among the South African population. Twenty-seven (27) welders were randomly selected, and data was collected using a structured questionnaire. The majority (67 percent of the welders) stated that they experience discomfort and pain whilst they carry out their task, which contradicts ergonomic guidelines for working posture. Forty-eight percent of the welding workers were frequently physically tired. Sixty-three (63) percent agree that they perform repetitive tasks, and a majority of 78% of welding workers reported neck discomfort as a result of tilting their neck posture for a longer period during welding operations. It was deduced that the correlation among risk factors associated with workstation design, repetitive tasks, contribute to the awkward posture adopted whilst welding, that, if retained for a long duration, could lead to musculoskeletal injuries, poor quality of work, and reduced productivity. Based on these results, in order to increase productivity, it was proposed to redesign the welding workstations and to prioritize interventional ergonomic programme to minimize the MSDs problems.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In recent years, policies that extend the working life have been a key feature of European and other countries with post-industrialised economies. These policies focus on two dimensions of work and retirement which governments consider crucial to reform if pension systems are to be safeguarded in the context of ageing populations. First, legal and administrative reforms are pushing back the legal age of retirement thereby withholding pension rights until workers have reached a certain age. Second, defined benefit pensions, so-called because employees and employers know the formula for calculating retirement benefits in advance of paying them, are being phased out and replaced by defined contribution pensions, where the level of contributions, and not the final benefit, is pre-defined and no final pension promise is made. This shift results in the individualisation of pension benefits, since in most cases workers must build up sufficient contributions and invest in pension products on financial markets. The effect of this trend is that workers remain in the labour force longer in order to secure an acceptable pension benefit. Overall, the implementation of these two policies to extend the working life has produced the desired effect of retaining individuals longer in the labour market and easing the pressure on public pensions, as can be seen in data produced by Eurostat since the 1990s: the proportion of people aged 55\\xa0years or more in the total number of persons employed in the EU-27 increased from 12% to 20% between 2004 and 2019 (Eurostat, 2021).',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Nature-inspired computing (NIC) computer optimization algorithms are an emerging approach that relies on the principles and inspiration of the biological development of nature to build new and strong competitive tactics. Given the success of NIC approaches and techniques in big data analytic applications, it is expected that they may also be effectively applied in health care. The application of NIC in the management of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a beneficial tool that may be widely employed in clinical and public health decision-making. Recent developments in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and bio-inspired optimization algorithms have boosted the relevance of biomedical signal and image processing research. Biomedical image processing is comparable in theory to biomedical signal processing in many aspects. It comprises the analysis, enhancement, and display of photographs collected via X-rays, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear medicine, and visual imaging technologies. NIC is presently quickly emerging in many scientific and technological research domains, including biomedical sciences. In this perspective, nature optimization algorithms may play a key role in addressing the multiple elements of health care. Researchers, healthcare policymakers, physicians, and other interested parties might use the insights of our chapter to better prioritize research and development for the operationalization of AI in the event of future pandemics.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This study analyzed stress adaptation in university students, considering the role of cognitive appraisal in the relationship between stress and burnout during the testing season. A total of 187 students from a university in the northern region of Portugal participated in the study. In the total sample, 154 were female (82.4%) and 32 males (17.1%), aged between 17 and 41\\xa0years old ( M \\u2009=\\u200920.72; SD \\u2009=\\u20093.28). The evaluation protocol included a Sociodemographic Questionnaire, the Stress Questionnaire for Students, the Primary and Secondary Cognitive Appraisal Scale, and the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure. The results showed that 55.6% of the students perceived high-stress levels, mainly derived from academic evaluation and work overload. Cognitive appraisal mediated the relationship between the overall level of students’ academic stress and the experience of burnout, mostly regarding physical fatigue and cognitive weariness. These findings reinforce the importance of considering the role of cognitive appraisal processes in understanding the dynamics of stress adaptation among university students. To promote healthy educational environments, we must attend to these effects regarding occupational safety and hygiene interventions within the academic context.',\n",

IoT plays an important role in almost every sphere of the world, may it be physical sensor connection to the cloud, the Structural Health Monitoring Systems (SHMS), Smart Homes, Health care, etc. Healthcare Internet of Things (H-IoT) has taken the healthcare sector to the next level by incorporating remote patient monitoring and diagnosis, Robotic surgeries, patient’s vital data monitoring in real time, etc. This paper presents a novel and a simple technique of remotely monitoring patients suffering from highly contagious diseases like the Corona Virus, thereby reducing the direct patient–doctor physical contact and ensuring the social distance. The patients’ medical data is acquired and end-to-end encryption is done on the data to ensure no loss of the data between the transmitting end and the receiving end. The designed system is based on the Node_Mcu microcontroller platform. The sensor data is acquired and processed using the Arduino-Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and further predictions regarding the patient’s health are performed in the MATLAB 2019a computation software.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Precision medicine has emerged as an optimal health-care delivery platform, which emphasizes integration of individual patient characteristics into patient care. For lung cancer, precision approaches have focused mostly on targeted therapies directed at tyrosine kinases and immunotherapy. It is proposed that refinements should focus on improved risk stratification of patients at heightened risk of lung malignancy, namely patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). African ancestry is associated with worsened clinical outcomes in COPD and lung cancer, which is relevant for Latinx populations given that varying degrees of African ancestry exist among several Latinx subgroups. The work reviewed here focuses on ORF1p, a protein encoded by Long Interspersed Element-1 (LINE-1) and associated with genetic instability. Because high expression of ORF1p is associated with poor prognosis in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), it is hypothesized that circulating ORF1p can be monitored as a proxy of genetic instability in patients with COPD and lung cancer. Circulating ORF1p levels correlate with FEV1 deficits and airflow limitation (the hallmark of COPD) in former smokers, and tissue expression of ORF1p is increased in TP53 mutant NSCLC compared to wildtype. Understanding the role of ORF1p in COPD and lung cancer and its utility as a biomarker of genetic instability may lead to advances in lung cancer care and development of novel targeted therapies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Corona Virus (COVID-19) is a virus that is endemic almost all over the world, including Indonesia. COVID-19 was first confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019, in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, and then rapidly expanded outside of China. To suppress the Covid-19 case, medical volunteers are needed as the main actors in efforts to handle Covid-19 patients. This makes health care facilities also need to focus on the principles of health worker safety, not only focus on the principles of patient safety. This also makes health care facilities also need to focus on the principles of health worker safety, not only focus on the principles of patient safety. The use of hazmat clothes is one of the efforts to protect health workers when in contact with Covid-19 patients. Hazmat clothes are technically referred to as “encapsulated waterproof protective clothing” which is PPE that must be used for officers from the risk of contracting the Covid-19 virus through airborne droplets and contact with patients and patient body fluids. Although hazmat clothing is an important PPE for health workers to stay protected, the use of hazmat clothing for a long time often makes medical personnel feel uncomfortable when providing services. Based on the problems above, the researchers conducted a study on the heat pipe - thermoelectric hazmat suit cooling vest. This technology can absorb more heat than other methods by simply applying the principle of capillarity to the wicks on the pipe walls. schematic of testing a cooling vest on a hazmat suit. The loading on the thermoelectric is given through the DC - Power supply. The temperature data read by the sensor will be detected by the computer system using the NI 9123 and C-DAQ 9174 modules. The test results can be viewed using the NI LabView 2017 software. The temperature used in this experiment is the result of tests carried out for 30\\xa0min. Based on the tests that have been carried out, the heat pipe-based thermoelectric hazmat suit cooling vest has been able to reach the lowest thermoelectric temperature of 24,42\\xa0 $$^\\\\circ{\\\\rm C} $$ ∘ C , which is distributed through heat pipes to body parts.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Accurate state of health (SOH) estimation of the lithium-ion battery plays an important role in ensuring the reliability and safety of the battery management system (BMS). The data-driven method based on the selection of degradation features can be effectively applied to SOH estimation. In practice, lithium batteries often work in complex discharge conditions, but they are charged under constant current (CC) conditions. Therefore, the suitable degradation features of the battery are extracted in this work for accurate SOH estimation. First, the degradation features are summarized and extracted from the CC charging data. Second, the Pearson correlation coefficient is utilized to quantify the relationship between the extracted degradation features and the battery SOH, thus determining the most influential degradation feature. Finally, the long short term memory (LSTM) is used for model training and SOH estimation based on the selected feature. The results show that LSTM model can give reliable and accurate SOH estimation with $$R^2$$ R 2 of 1 and lower mean absolute error (MAE) and maximum error (MAX).',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The assessment of student wellbeing has been often static and lagged behind for the intervention/diagnostic purpose. In this chapter, we aim to introduce an automated school wellbeing scoring dynamic real-time system, School Day Wellbeing Model. With Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based item sampling methods and answers scoring and reporting systems, the School Day Wellbeing Model can collect wellbeing data at low cognitive cost, track wellbeing real time at multiple levels (e.g., individual-, class-, school-level), and give immediate feedback. The model is constructed on the basis of the School Wellbeing Model, Study Demand-Resource Model, and OECD Social-Emotional Skill Model. In the book chapter, the wellbeing assessments, including AI-based assessments, are reviewed so that the strengths of the School Day Wellbeing Model are highlighted. User experiences are collected to show the utility of the model. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for such a model is imperatively high as students’ wellbeing has been largely dampened. As a result, the model has been appreciated by users and has served about 55,000 students so far in the globe. The future development of the model is also discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This chapter takes as its starting point theorizing around nutrition and food system transitions thought to be increasingly occurring in urban Africa, and how this may be linked to a growing non-communicable disease burden. We focus specifically on the secondary city context by analysing household survey data gathered from six cities across Ghana, Kenya and Uganda during 2013–2015. We asked how diet composition and diversity, food sources and food security varied by socio-economic status, using expenditure and demographic data to create a proxy for household well-being. In this way, we investigate one of the claimed keystones affecting urban food systems and dietary health in sub-Saharan Africa—that of obesogenic urban food environments. Our findings indicate that the socio-economic status of a household was the most important factor influencing household dietary diversity and food security status, i.e. better-off households were more likely to feel food secure and eat from a greater variety of food groups. In addition, the number of income sources was additionally associated with higher dietary diversity. We also found that a household’s involvement in agriculture had only a small positive effect on food security in one city and was associated with a reduction in dietary diversity scores. Our findings emphasize the importance of supporting aggregated national and international statistics on agricultural production and trade with detailed local analyses that focus on actual household food access and consumption. We also see reasons to be cautious about making causal claims regarding consumption change and obesogenic urban environments as the major contributor to a rising obesity and non-communicable disease burden in Africa.',\n",

In Indonesia, as in many countries in the world, public activities involving many people are restricted and regulated to prevent the virus’ broader spread. Technology which still enables activities to be conducted individually and remotely is needed, because during the pandemic, they can only be done very limitedly, if not stopped. Therefore, people are utilizing telecommunications to assist activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several innovations involving telecommunication technology are applied, e.g., distance learning (e-learning), online business (e-commerce), and digital health services (e-health). However, there are many challenges in using telecommunication technology during a pandemic in developing countries, especially in Indonesia. This article examines (1) the role of telecommunication technology in education, economy, and health sectors, (2) the challenges, and (3) how telecommunication technology as the solution can be more effective in future. This article provides an outlook and in-depth overview of how the impact of recent technology, especially telecommunication, played a vital role in the three crucial sectors in mid-low countries like Indonesia during the COVID-19 outbreak.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The robustness of Non-Destructive Testing methods is typically quantified through the computation of Probability of Detection (POD) curves. Current design standards in aviation recommend the implementation of these curves also for Guided Waves based Structural Health Monitoring (GWSHM) systems. POD curves are greatly influenced by the uncertainties that may exist within the SHM acquisition due to operational and environmental conditions. These uncertainties play a particularly important role in the detection of Barely Visible Impact Damage (BVID) in complex composite structures. In this work, a digital clone platform that is created with the aid of a Bayesian calibration of a Finite Element (FE) model, is used to complement the experimental measurements. Based on the estimations of the platform it is possible to generate a numerical sample of impact events that allows the estimation of the Model Assisted Probability of Detection (MAPOD), considering the underlying uncertainties. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated for a surface mounted network of sensors that is permanently attached onto a composite structure.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This chapter fuses critical institutionalism and literary analysis, along with autobiographical autoethnographic anecdotes, to formulate an account of absurdity in the English public sector. The lesser-known work of the renowned Polish satirist Sławomir Mrożek ‘Chocolates for the Director’ (original: Czekoladki dla Prezesa ) is explored and utilized as a framework to exemplify institutional farce. Mrożek’s work encapsulated the hypernormalized ‘fake world’ public organization practices typical of Soviet-era Poland, and his literary style and role characterizations are studied in this chapter. The account considers the realm of bureaucratic practices and rituals in contemporary England; the author’s own reflections of studying the National Health Service ethnographically and working within it and in Higher Education are drawn upon, including in the ‘old normal’ and the pandemic eras. The chapter stays faithful to the literary genre of absurdism and offers no solutions.',\n",

The evolution from a hunter-gatherer society to a modern civilized society puts the human mind in the most challenging situations. Stressful life and unhealthy coping behavior make us depressed and that lead to suicide. Different lifestyle guides and therapy practices help people who are hurting themselves. Another popular service people are comfortable with using is smartphone apps. The number of mental health app users is increasing, but the suicide rate is still high. Especially in developing countries like Bangladesh, where psychopathological factors are mostly stress, anxiety, and depression. We have limited resources, no suicide surveillance system, and no authority to monitor the statistics. Services dedicated to suicide prevention are mostly volunteer or private groups, also not accessible to all people. In this research, we studied ways to determine the severity of mental disorders and offer a smartphone application for appropriate help. Through our mobile application, we analyze and categorize diseases and suggest users’ actions to take. In times of crisis, users can contact emergency help services or professionals or friends and families for support.',\n",

This latter is composed by five building located in the city of L’Aquila that is hosting SICURA - “ caSa Intelligente delle teCnologie per la sicURezza - L’Aquila ” one of the 5 “ houses of emerging technologies” (Case delle Tecnologie Emergenti) promoted by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (MiSE) to promote the exploitation of 5G, IoT and blockchain technologies to improve the public safety. Advantages coming from such new technologies will have beneficial effects in the management of the monitored structural data and information. One of the most relevant consists in the designing and implementation of possible strategy of early warning solutions in case of seismic events. Indeed, the 5G-based architecture can reduce the latency and increase the reliability of the measured and transmitted data. Another aspect regards the improvements connected to traditional monitoring and control procedures of the buildings. The continuous and synchronized knowledge of the whole structural health network allows to quickly identify the areas most affected during and after a critical event. A single building constitutes a sort of sentinel addressing in opportune and adequate way the emergency interventions. Such scenario poses the bases for the developing of Digital Twin models at single building and city level.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This chapter considers the role of positive emotions in religion/spirituality. We begin by reviewing key conceptual frameworks of positive emotions (e.g., Broaden-and-Build Theory of Positive Emotions) while focusing on self-transcendent positive emotions such as awe, gratitude, love, and compassion. We then review scientific research on the bidirectional relationship between religion/spirituality and positive emotions. First, we examine various pathways through which religion/spirituality promotes the experience of positive emotions. For example, research has shown that religion/spirituality is related to specific valued emotions and particular emotion-regulation strategies. In addition, religious/spiritual (R/S) practices provide the opportunity to experience positive emotions, partly through emotional embodiment. Second, we propose four effects of positive emotions related to religion/spirituality. Positive emotions support R/S beliefs, and when they are felt during R/S practices, they function as promoters of well-being, prosocial intentions and behaviors, and continued R/S practices (the Upward Spiral Theory of Sustained Religious Practice). We close by offering some applications of these findings for mental health practitioners, religious leaders, and religiously/spiritually oriented people.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This work assessed firefighters’ exposure to particulate matter (PM) in non-fire work settings during pre-fire season, as a baseline for the respective occupational exposure characterization. Indoor and outdoor air sampling was conducted for two weeks in pre-fire season of 2021 in seven fire corporations (FC1-FC7) in north of Portugal. PM fractions (PM 2.5 , PM 10 ) were continuously monitored concurrently in indoors (living rooms, rest areas, truck bays) and outdoors. The results showed low levels of pollution. Indoor PM 10 was between 2 and 205\\xa0μg\\xa0m –3 (mean 10\\xa0μg\\xa0m –3 ); PM 2.5 were 2—115\\xa0μg\\xa0m –3 (8.5\\xa0μg\\xa0m –3 ). Both indoor PM fractions were highly and significantly correlated (r s \\u2009=\\u20090.959–0.997). PM 2.5 accounted for 85% of indoor PM; indoor to outdoor ratios (I/O) of PM 2.5 ranged between 1.4 and 3.0, thus emphasizing the contribution of indoor emission sources for fine fraction. Outdoor PM 10 were 2–6 times higher than indoors (6–894\\xa0μg\\xa0m –3 ; mean 21\\xa0μg\\xa0m –3 ); and 2–9 times higher for PM 2.5 (5 – 169\\xa0μg\\xa0m –3 ; 5\\xa0μg\\xa0m –3 ). Outdoor PM were moderately correlated (r s \\u2009=\\u20090.584 – 0.878), most likely due to meteorological conditions. Coarse particles contributed the majority of ambient PM 10 and accounted for 79%.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Many human motor function impairments are caused due to a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, motor dysfunction disabilities and age-related issues. As the geriatric population progresses, the need for novel solutions to manage age-related diseases increases. To combat this, intensive rehabilitation treatment is instituted repetitively. However, the traditional rehabilitation treatment regimes, involving tedious and monotonous activity with numerous repetitions, lacking active patient participation are of boring and strenuous nature. This ultimately leads to suboptimal treatment outcomes necessitating long-term care. To overcome this, a range of interactive and easy measuring technology-based innovative solutions fused with the rehabilitation process is being investigated to ameliorate the effectiveness and productivity of rehabilitation programs and escalate the independence of patients and empower them to administer their treatment. Recently, game-based Virtual Reality (VR) rehabilitation protocol has turned out to be a promising therapeutic alternative, amalgamating Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) with VR to activate neuro-motor functions, sustain motivation and reach rehabilitation goals to improve the quality of life of patients. Virtual rehabilitation is a computer-generated interactive patient-centred simulation system combining computers, special interfaces, and simulation exercises that imitates reality and provides an artificial environment mimicking real-world experience. The architecture of the system is designed in such a way that it can remotely track the patients, obtain data, and tailor the rehabilitation sessions according to the current needs of the patients. VR improves both motor skills and confidence for daily living and in numerous situations to enhance functional results, improving the clinical and social benefits of surgery. Thus, game-based VR is being developed to allow clinicians to create game-based VR tasks and this will serve to drive advances in rehabilitation interventions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Objective This study aims to characterise the occupational exposure to the bioburden of groceries workers and to identify the most critical workstations. Background To our knowledge, this is the first study performed in Portugal that intends to characterise the microbial contamination in this specific setting. Method This study was conducted between November and December of 2020 in fifteen groceries stores (M) located in the municipality of Cascais. Passive sampling methods (Electrostatic dust cloths—EDC) and surface swabs were used at three different locations (checkout, fruits/vegetable and warehouse/dispenser areas). EDC and surface swabs were inoculated in four standard culture media, namely, malt extract agar (MEA), dichloran glycerol (DG18), tryptic soy agar (TSA) and violet red bile agar (VRBA) for further characterisation. Results The prevalence of bacterial contamination was higher than fungal contamination in both sampling methods. The highest prevalence was in the fruits/vegetable area regarding fungal and bacterial contamination. Conclusion The sampling methods employed effectively identified the most critical workplaces regarding microbial contamination. Application This study will be useful for industrial hygienists since it is the first held in small grocery shops focusing in the occupational exposure assessment of microbiological contamination.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The current and looming challenges of food safety and food security need an approach that involves expertise from a combination of different disciplines to effectively tackle the issues associated with them. This is because food security has diverse areas, and research in all of these areas are important, and would make a meaningful contribution to providing the required solutions to the problem. The food chain from “farm to fork” involves a series of activities, which include harvesting, transportation, processing, preparation, and consumption. For proper health benefits derivable from any food product to be maximised, the steps of food processing and/or preparation become critical due to the loss of nutrients during processing. Carbohydrates are not usually considered as part of nutrients lost during heat processing like other nutrients such as vitamins and proteins, however, considerable losses to nutritionally important complex carbohydrates such as dietary fibre and resistant starch occur during grinding and milling. Resistant starch type 1 (RS1) in foods is a valuable food ingredient that can help reduce diabetes, obesity, and other non-communicable diseases and improve food and nutrition security if its benefits are properly annexed. This chapter aims to draw attention to the usefulness of resistant starch in foods (particularly resistant starch type 1) and proffers ways by which resistant starch can be protected during processing, which will enhance functional food and nutrition security. Economic benefits of resistant starch in foods are also highlighted.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Nutritional disorders are common among adolescents. More than half of the adolescent population living in LMICs have micronutrient deficiencies due to food insecurity and various sociocultural factors. Fad diets are a less known and researched cause of nutritional disorders in this region. With globalization, westernization, increased digital media penetration and normative autonomy bids, peer pressure and emotional reactivity in adolescence and young adulthood, the prevalence of disordered eating behavior, eating disorders and adoption of fad diets are on the rise in LMICs. Hence adolescent health professionals need to screen for fad diets while eliciting a routine nutritional history in clinical practice. Most adolescents resist behavior change and tend to be defiant. Counselling by a sensitive, empathic, and non-judgmental health professional could motivate them to make healthy choices. We describe a case of an adolescent girl from India presenting with nutritional anemia after she had turned vegan. Motivational interviewing by the health professional enabled her to adopt a balanced diet and follow the therapeutic plan that resulted in resolution of anemia.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Foodborne diseases are a major public health problem in African cities. Residents of secondary cities are often more at risk due to relatively low capacity for municipalities to provide hygiene infrastructure and to enforce food safety regulations. This study aimed to explore underlying factors that are associated with hygienic practices among food traders in Mzuzu, Malawi and Dschang, Cameroon. A multistage cross-sectional study design was conducted to sample 497 food traders in Mzuzu and 848 traders in Dschang. A questionnaire was administered to obtain data related to food safety practices, knowledge and sociodemographic characteristics of participants. Problems revealed by the survey included a lack of the following: knowledge about food safety regulations; toilet and hand washing facilities; waste bins and health inspections. The study suggests poor compliance of food hygiene practices among food traders. It highlights the lack of adequate action by the municipal government in educating food traders and enforcing food safety regulations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The occupational risk assessment methodology called Level of Preventive Action (Lpac) evaluates the amount of preventive action to obtain an optimal prevention level, measuring the degree of danger concerning the building geometry, the worker position concerning the slab edge and the worker’s emotional states. The mathematical basis of Lpac can be extended to include the perspective of collective behaviour models, which can describe the predictable human behaviour based on the probability of acts. Research in the mathematical field satisfactorily models the movement that individuals follow or will follow in different scenarios (e.g., street crossing, emergency evacuation), including social parameters such as mood and emotions. This paper presents a theoretical case applied to the predictive analysis of behaviours and interactions between individuals working on constructing a slab. It is essential to include the worker’s movement prediction regarding unsafe acts and movements in the risk assessment and add the emotional states. From a case study at the microscopic level, stress can trigger dangerous situations, and its evaluation can prevent them.',\n",

The survey method was used, as the study population consists of Jordanian University Students who are regular in the academic year 2020/2021. A representative and available random sample was taken from those who could be reached electronically by distributing an electronic survey questionnaire, and the final number of the sample was (421). Social networks can play a positive role in disseminating and circulating information related to the Corona Pandemic, as it showed that the respondents supported increasing their knowledge about the Pandemic through social networks. Motivation based on want of knowledge tops the results with (high) level. As for the emotional effects, they were generally rated (moderate). The results showed that the behavioral influences were also (moderate).As for the follow-up topics, the study revealed that the search for the production of antivirus-vaccines was the forerunner of all the follow-up issues, as was the methods of prevention and side effects of the virus, while the level of follow-up of government instructions and the spreading status of the pandemic in the world decreased to lower levels. With regard to the demographic variables relating to the other variables, it appeared that there were no significant statistical differences, while these differences only appeared in relation to the master’s degree students.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Vibration-based damage detection approaches have received considerable attention in the field of structural health monitoring. Modal parameters are often adopted to define damage-sensitive features, since their strong physical meaning can help interpreting the structural condition. On the other hand, they are also sensitive to changes to environmental and operational conditions. This aspect is critical for an automatic damage detection, because changes in modal parameters due to varying external factors (e.g. temperature) can be greater than those caused by damage. In this context, this paper proposes an application to real data coming from long-term structural health monitoring of axially-loaded beam-like structures under realistic environment. These very common structural elements are usually subject to an axial load that changes under environmental and operating conditions. Since the axial load is not directly known in most real applications, assessing damage using modal-based damage features is a complicated task. In this paper, a data driven approach that does not require a knowledge of the axial load is proposed to filter out the environmental effects on modal-based damage features. The strategy has been successfully tested on data acquired in an uncontrolled environment, and resulted in being a promising solution for real structural health monitoring applications.',\n",

The study followed the descriptive analytical approach due to its relevance to the nature of this study, through qualitative and quantitative tools, namely, the interview and the questionnaire. Interviews were conducted with the heads of the emergency committee, which consisted of governors, mayors and chambers of commerce, health directors, and heads of financial committees in the governorates. The questionnaire dealt with the point of view of Palestinian citizens in the northern governorates. And the study sample amounted to (1064). The results of the interviews reflected the commitment and response of citizens in the first months of the epidemic, as well as a full awareness and response to dealing with safety and prevention measures, after which the interest decreased and the response became like ebb and flow, and therefore there has become a complacency in behavior, especially in wearing masks and physical distancing, and the large number of gatherings, Which is considered a negative indicator in dealing with the emerging corona virus. From the results of the questionnaire, it was found that the impact of the Corona epidemic on citizens in the northern governorates in terms of health was a high percentage of 74%, and in terms of social terms, the percentage was high, amounting to 78%. On the economic side, it was average, with a percentage of 69%. The education rate is also high, at 78%.

       "  'abstract': 'As monitoring data becomes increasingly available, it is natural for structural health monitoring practitioners to turn towards data-driven models. Despite the expressive capability and flexibility of such models, their predictive performance relies on access to suitably represenative training data, which in structural health monitoring, equates to data that span the full environmental and operational envelope of the structure. Additionally, given the black-box nature of such models, there is no guarantee that predictions will adhere to fundamental physical principles. In an attempt to address these limitations, recent attention has been directed towards models that seek to combine physical insight with traditional machine learning techniques, referred to generally as physics-informed machine learning or grey-box modelling. In this paper, we seek to incorporate physical insight into a Gaussian process through the use of covariance functions that explicitly capture the evolution of dynamic systems in time. Specifically, within an autoregressive setting, we begin by deriving the covariance for the approximate response of a single degree of freedom system. Consideration is then given to how such kernels may be used when the governing parameters in the equations of motion vary over time, which is investigated here through a varying temperature, and consequently, structural stiffness. It is demonstrated that the derived grey-box models are able to outperform equivalent physics-based and data-driven models over a number of simulated case studies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The hospitality industry (also called HoReCa in some European countries) is one of the most vulnerable sectors in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also one of the sectors of greatest economic relevance for many of the countries with strong reliance on tourism. Despite the fact that the scientific community has focused on the development of solutions that allow reducing the impact of the pandemic, its implementation in the hospitality industry has been so far residual. In this work, we present a technological solution that allows to detect and quantify variables related to the risk of contagion of airborne diseases (e.g., COVID-19) through the monitoring of environmental variables (e.g., CO 2 , CO $$_{2{\\\\text {-eq}}}$$ 2 -eq , suspended particulate matter, temperature, humidity, etc.). The acquired data is sent following the FIWARE NGSI “IndoorEnvironmentObserved” standard and then displayed through a Grafana interface, where real-time contagion risk indicators can be seen. The presented system has been developed within the HORECoV-21 project, where additional features such as automatic people counting, indoor social distance control, and virus detection systems in wastewater improve the quality of contagion risk predictions. Pilot tests have been carried out, which show that the proposed solution can reduce the risk of contagion in the hospitality industry and the like, through graphs, visual indicators and flags that warn whenever it is necessary to take active measures (e.g., activating ventilation) thus increasing health safety in establishments and reducing the impact of the pandemic without incurring a high cost for businesses.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Male infertility may depend by pre-testicular (for example, hypothalamic or pituitary diseases), testicular, and post-testicular (for example, obstructive pathologies of seminal ducts) causes. However, a large proportion (30–60%) of infertile males does not receive a clear diagnosis. In these cases, generally reported as idiopathic infertility, there is a strong suspicion of genetic factors yet to be discovered. Furthermore, male fertility may be influenced by a host of lifestyle risk factors such as environment, nutrition, exposure to infections, and smoking. Therefore, lifestyle and environment risk factors may have a role in many cases of idiopathic male infertility. In this chapter, we focus our attention on these risk factors, discussing three paradigmatic situations of interference between environment/lifestyle and male fertility, thus providing the pathophysiological basis of their detrimental impact on male fertility: exposure to environmental endocrine disruptors, such as perfluoro-alkyl substances (PFAS); exposure to viruses, such as HPV; effect of nutritional status and obesity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Italy was the first European democracy hit by COVID-19 and among the countries experiencing the most dramatic death tolls. Its outbreak and diffusion represented a veritable test for the Italian political system. When the pandemic crisis started, PM Giuseppe Conte headed a coalition government composed by the centre-left Democratic Party and the Five Star Movement. This was an untested and fragile coalition, governing a country in difficult economic conditions and under tight budgetary constraints. To provide a timely response to the pandemic crisis, decision-making was further centralised in the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, with Parliament entrusted, instead, with a marginal or at best reactive role. Yet, both tensions between levels of government—i.e., central government vs. regions—and within the government coalition constrained the effectiveness of executive action. Initially, the pandemic emergency was de-politicised. Its politicisation occurred later, when the crisis became less acute. In early 2021, however, the formation of a super grand coalition supporting the new PM Mario Draghi led to further de-politicisation. The rollout of the vaccination plan and the effective spending of the EU Recovery Funds were widely regarded as necessities leaving little space for party-political games.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Every adolescent has multiple aspects of their identity including sex assigned at birth (generally based off an individual’s external anatomy), gender identity (how an individual describes their internal sense of gender), gender expression (all the ways in which an individual expresses their gender), and sexual orientation (how an individual characterizes their emotional and sexual attraction to others). LGBTQ+ describes communities of individuals that identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and includes other identities such as intersex and asexual. Unique aspects of LGBTQ+ adolescent identities and societal expectations may affect their conceptualization of body appearance and eating habits. This can lead to disordered eating which can present as engagement in fad diets. For example, studies have found that transgender and gender diverse individuals are at higher risk of disordered eating and eating disorders. This highlights the importance of open and non-judgmental communication around gender between providers and adolescents to build rapport and provide sensitive care around nutrition and body image.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background Morbidity and Mortality (M&M) conferences allow clinicians to review adverse events and identify areas for improvement. There are few reports of structured M&M conferences in low- and middle-income countries and no report of collaborative efforts to standardize them. Methods The present study aims to gather general surgeons representing most of Peru’s urban surgical care and, in collaboration, with trauma quality improvement experts develop a M&M conferences toolkit with the expectation that its diffusion impacts their reported clinical practice. Fourteen general surgeons developed a toolkit as part of a working group under the auspices of the Peruvian General Surgery Society. After three years, we conducted an anonymous written questionnaire to follow-up previous observations of quality improvement practices. Results A four-component toolkit was developed: Toolkit component #1: Conference logistics and case selection; Toolkit component #2: Documenting form; Toolkit component #3: Presentation template; and Toolkit component #4: Code of conduct. The toolkit was disseminated to 10 hospitals in 2016. Its effectiveness was evaluated by comparing the results of surveys on quality improvement practices conducted in 2016, before toolkit dissemination (101 respondents) and 2019 (105 respondents). Lower attendance was reported by surgeons in 2019. However, in 2019, participants more frequently described “improve the system” as the perceived objective of M&M conferences (70.5% vs. 38.6% in 2016; p \\u2009<\\u20090.001). Conclusion We established a toolkit for the national dissemination of a standardized M&M conference. Three years following the initial assessment in Peru, we found similar practice patterns except for increased reporting of “system improvement” as the goal of M&M conferences.',\n",

There has been continuous research made worldwide to combat this global public health crisis. The infectious cases have already crossed over 223 million cases as per WHO, so far. Internet of things (IoT) is one of the main tools that have to break the ground with its numerous benefits. The IoT has changed the outlook of the modern healthcare system. Various devices embedded with the internet are used to minimize the spread of COVID-19. These devices help in early diagnosing, performing necessary procedures, and monitoring patients’ health. This paper outlines the role of IoT based technologies as to how it is used for combating the novel severe respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 and also proposes a better solution for the patients to identify the efficient healthcare unit when suffering from a health issue.

       "  'abstract': 'Structural health monitoring (SHM) is the continuous on-board monitoring of a structure’s condition during operation by integrated systems of sensors. Standard methods of SHM are vibration-based methods like the electromechanical impedance (EMI) method. This method uses a piezoelectric transducer that is attached to a mechanical structure of interest. The transducer is supplied by a harmonic voltage that results in a typically harmonic oscillation of both transducer and structure and allows to monitor the combined dynamic response by measuring the supplied current, and thus, the impedance. Changes of the impedance reflect changes of the structure and can be used to conclude on a potential damage. Today, linear response is typically evaluated by the EMI. Critical damages like delamination in fiber reinforced polymer components could also provoke nonlinear response that might allow more conclusions on the damage. This contribution demonstrates the existence of contact acoustic nonlinearity in an aluminum beam with a free-edge-delamination-like subsurface crack at the end. The investigation is based on transfer frequency response functions between an exciting transducer and out-of-plane surface velocities of the beam measured by laser Doppler scanning vibrometry. For identification of the nonlinear response an identification method is used and verified that is readily published. Furthermore, the diffusion of the nonlinear behavior shall be investigated to conclude on its possible measurement by a transducer that is located at some distance to such a damage.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'COVID-19 has transformed face-to-face learning interactions and forced children to stay home and connect through online education. During COVID-19, the Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia established the Madrasty platform as the new gateway for distance teaching and learning for the 1st to 12th grade for the 2020–2021 school year. However, students have faced many issues with the platform related to usability and features. This paper aims to improve the design of the Madrasty website educational in Saudi Arabia during online education through applying the Design Thinking approach as a foundation to extract the requirement set for a design prototype with complete features options to support remote learning. In addition to investigating the level of depression between the physical school attendance and remote school attendance in Saudi Arabia, this comparison is to consider adding the feature of mental health states to the educational website for remote learning. The authors studied the issues in Madrasty and proposed the newly updated platform, including a set of new features to resolve the problems in the existing platform. Usability testing was conducted with two types of users- teachers and students. The usability testing consists of two phases: 1) a list of tasks to measure features’ usability, and 2) a post-test questionnaire to measure users’ level of satisfaction. The result shows an excellent rate in the number of participants in both groups regarding the number of clicks and time to perform the tasks.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Lactation is critical to infant short-term and long-term health and protects mothers from breast cancer, ovarian cancer and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The mammary gland is a dynamic organ, regulated by the coordinated actions of reproductive and metabolic hormones. These hormones promote gland development from puberty onwards and induce the formation of a branched, epithelial, milk-secreting organ by the end of pregnancy. Progesterone withdrawal following placental delivery initiates lactation, which is maintained by increased pituitary secretion of prolactin and oxytocin, and stimulated by infant suckling. After weaning, local cytokine production and decreased prolactin secretion trigger large-scale mammary cell loss, leading to gland involution. Here, we review advances in the molecular endocrinology of mammary gland development and milk synthesis. We discuss the hormonal functions of the mammary gland, including parathyroid hormone-related peptide secretion that stimulates maternal calcium mobilization for milk synthesis. We also consider the hormonal composition of human milk and its associated effects on infant health and development. Finally, we highlight endocrine and metabolic diseases that cause lactation insufficiency, for example, monogenic disorders of prolactin and prolactin receptor mutations, maternal obesity and diabetes mellitus, interventions during labour and delivery, and exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as polyfluoroalkyl substances in consumer products and other oestrogenic compounds. The mammary gland is responsible for lactation and is regulated by the coordinated actions of reproductive and metabolic hormones. This Review discusses the hormonal regulation of lactation, hormonal functions of the mammary gland, the hormone composition of human milk, and endocrine and metabolic diseases that cause lactation insufficiency. Reproductive and metabolic hormones coordinate the transformation of the mammary gland from a rudimental ductal structure at the onset of puberty into a milk-secreting organ by the end of pregnancy. Lactation onset is mediated by a combination of progesterone withdrawal, circulating and mammary gland-derived prolactin, and glucocorticoids; delayed lactation onset is a major cause of early breastfeeding cessation. Established lactation requires prolactin and oxytocin for milk synthesis and let-down and involves mammary autocrine and paracrine mechanisms triggered by breast emptying; these local mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The mammary gland is an endocrine organ that secretes hormones into the maternal circulation and milk; hormones in milk influence infant development, body composition and the microbiome. Lactation insufficiency is caused by genetic and acquired endocrine disturbances; maternal factors with potential endocrine effects on lactation include primiparity, obesity, preterm birth, Caesarean section and retained placental fragments. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals are environmental pollutants that might affect lactation by altering hormone secretion or mammary gland hormone responsiveness; epidemiological studies highlight potential population-wide effects on breastfeeding.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are toxic compounds of global concern that adversely affect the environment and human health around the world. POPs are forbidden at worldwide level and regulated by the Stockholm Convention, managed by the UNEP. It was created in 2001 and entered into force in 2004 and currently has 184 members. POPs consist mainly of organochlorine pesticides, industrial compounds (PCBs, PBDEs, PFAS, PCN, and SCCPs), and chemical-delivered unintentional by-products of urban and industrial processes (dioxins and furans). They persist in the environment, are adsorbed to organic matter of soils and sediments, bioaccumulate in fatty tissues and biomagnify through the food web, and are transported across international boundaries far from their sources, through moving air masses, water currents, and migratory species. The dynamics of POPs in the environment depends on several factors, such as physicochemical characteristics of POPs and abiotic components, environmental conditions, and properties of the species inhabiting different ecosystems. In terrestrial and aquatic environments, plants, invertebrates, fish, birds, marine mammals, and other organisms can incorporate POPs directly from soils, sediments, and water and also through food chain.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Water and soil pollution is one of the top problems of environmental concern that has been worsened in the last years due to the lack of available water and overall resources. Owing to the difficulty in eliminating pollutants from the environment, applying cost-effective treatments to the anthropogenic sources of origin (i.e., wastewaters and industrial effluents) before they are discharged to the environment becomes a very good alternative. The presence of emerging pollutants (EPs) deserves special attention and is being considered in new regulations due to their adverse effects and/or persistence. Among them, a group with increasing presence is that related to the use of Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products (PPCPs). Triclosan (TCS; 5-Chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol) is an emerging antimicrobial contaminant that belongs to PPCPs. The extensive use of TCS has caused its presence in different water sources, especially in WWTPs effluents, lakes, rivers, and also in sediments throughout the world, posing a risk to the environment and human health. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs), defined as aqueous phase oxidation technologies based on the formation of highly reactive species, such as hydroxyl radicals ( • OH), have been successfully applied to the remediation of wastewaters containing recalcitrant organic compounds. However, depending on the operating conditions, AOPs can lead to the generation of by-products during the degradation of the primary pollutants that may increase the final toxicity of the treated water. In this way, TCS, along with its degradation/oxidation routes, has been related to the formation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as polychlorinated dibenzo- p -dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). Specifically, this chapter focuses on the potential of electrochemical and photocatalytic oxidation, in terms of TCS degradation rate and by-products formation, paying special attention to the potential formation of PCDD/Fs. The role of two electrolytes widely applied in electrochemical oxidation, NaCl and Na 2 SO 4 , as well as the influence of the concentration of a catalyst (TiO 2 ), on the photocatalytic medium, has been analyzed. The toxicity in the treated waters was assessed through the toxic equivalents (TEQ) expressed as the 2,3,7,8-TCDD TEQ concentration, where 2,3,7,8-TCDD is the most toxic congener (NATO Committee on the Challenges of Modern Society (NATO/CCMS)). After complete TCS degradation, TEQ reached a maximum value of 4.78\\xa0pg\\xa0L −1 in electrochemically remediated waters, using NaCl as electrolyte (19 times higher with respect to untreated water containing TCS), whereas the value of the photocatalytically treated waters with TiO 2 0.75\\xa0g\\xa0L −1 was 6.25\\xa0pg\\xa0L −1 (more than 25 times higher with respect to untreated water containing TCS). These results emphasize the importance of the quantitative traceability of the formation of by-products and the resulting toxicity (PCDD/Fs, TEQ,) when applying AOPs to polluted waters containing EPs, especially organochlorines, considered precursors of PCDD/Fs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Due to the implementation of new technologies, the healthcare sector now produces more data than ever before. This data is of high importance to patients but in many cases it is inaccessible. To counteract this effect, many mobile apps have been developed to aid patients in the management of their personal health data. In this article we will present an analysis and comparison of several apps of this sort, selected from those available within the Portuguese market. The goal of this analysis is to create a design framework for a new personal health management app to be developed.

       "  'abstract': 'In the 1980s, most households of rural India and Bangladesh switched from surface sources for their drinking water – which was causing high incidence of diarrheal disease – to groundwater extracted by hand pumps. However, for tens of millions of people, this groundwater contained high levels of arsenic, which has led to what the WHO has called the “largest mass poisoning of a population in history.” This case study describes the development of ElectroChemical Arsenic Remediation (ECAR), which is a technology that uses iron electrodes to oxidize and remove aqueous arsenic from drinking water. Pilot evaluation of ECAR began in 2011, with a 100\\xa0L reactor at a school in Amirabad. However, political tensions in Amirabad caused the subsequent 600\\xa0L reactor pilot to be relocated to a school in Dhapdhapi. The findings from this pilot enabled the construction of a 10,000-liter per day (LPD) ECAR plant at Dhapdhapi. During this scaling up process, technical and contextual challenges were encountered and overcome, including those arising from intermittent power supply and a hot/humid climate. Additionally, implementation challenges included training of local operators, ensuring continuity of knowledge within the team, revisiting and correcting early mistakes, and additional engineering work needed during commissioning. The 10,000 LPD plant has been successful both technically and financially. However, after the handoff of the ECAR technology and plant to the local partner, Livpure in 2016, no widespread replication of ECAR plants in the region has occurred. The engineering science behind ECAR continues to be an active area of research, with ongoing projects investigating the implementation of next-generation ECAR technologies in rural California and the Philippines.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Protecting and promoting the rights of vulnerable groups is an internationally recognised standard for good governance and inclusive development. This is underscored by the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) as essential to strengthening democracy and political governance in Africa. This chapter reviews the progress made by the Republic of South Africa since 2019 on the rights of vulnerable groups. It argues that practices and affirmative actions towards combatting prejudice or eliminating conditions that perpetuate discrimination against vulnerable and marginalised groups at both national and sub-national levels in South Africa have produced mixed results. These include challenges of designing and implementing policies and programmes of social inclusion that address the vulnerabilities of immigrant populations—asylum seekers, refugees, undocumented migrants and gender non-conforming people. Similarly, public and service delivery systems have not prioritised protective measures to secure their lives, properties and livelihoods against violence. Therefore, cooperative governance, socio-economic inclusion and support for vulnerable groups should be incorporated into the national development priorities of South Africa. Starting with the review of national intervention programmes, an overhaul of public participation mechanisms and processes to enhance efficiency in service delivery is critical to sustainably address these challenges.',\n",

India has the second largest military force in the worlds with the strength of 1.4 million active troops. The army people lose their valuable lives due to lack of technical infrastructure to provide status about the injured soldiers. Many lose their lives and become disabilities because of injuries rather than battlefield. Nowadays, there are vast amount of electronic gadgets to fight against the enemies and secure the nation in the border. But in some adverse conditions like bad weather or due to remote location of soldiers, it becomes impossible to interact with them and monitor their health conditions of militants. In this work, we are developing a modern wearable smart thong entrenched with system of system facility and mobile ad hoc network. It has the special feature of continuously monitoring the health condition of troops. It also continuously records the health parameters and environmental parameters of the military warriors so that valuable lives of soldiers which is significant asset to our country can be rescued at right time.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the wind energy industry, wind turbines are subject to enormous mechanical loads and extreme environmental conditions during operation, which is why damage detection methodologies play a vital role in their operation. In order to reduce costs and guarantee the integrity and longevity of such structures, the use of a reliable Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) methodology, capable of detecting structural defects, is crucial to plan and perform maintenance operations in a way to extend the lifetime of these structures. In this context, Machine Learning (ML) techniques have succeeded in a broad range of applications and can be leveraged to develop accurate and automated SHM procedures. In this work, two different methodologies were successfully implemented to recognize deviating patterns from the healthy state, to detect anomalies in the dynamic response of wind turbine blades. One methodology combines automated modal analysis and the classification of modal parameters with a Multivariate Gaussian anomaly detection technique. The other uses Autoencoders (AEs) to classify frequency-domain data of the structure, i.e., frequency response functions or cross-power spectral densities. The response of the structures was obtained through modal shaker, modal hammer, and pull-and-release testing.',\n",

First, the interconnection with the self that is how we construction the image of ourselves impacts how we interpret and perceive different stimuli or experiences, and this has an impact on our flourishing. Second, the interconnection with others impacts the relationship we build with them, and this relationship impacts our flourishing.

       "  'abstract': 'Gestational period is a significant factor in determining the well-being and survival of the infant. An abnormal gestational period has adverse effects on the mother and fetus, which might even lead to mortality. Machine learning offers the solution by analyzing the maternal and fetal attributes and predicting the number of gestational days ahead of time. In this study, we develop various machine learning models, to determine the gestational days by analyzing the maternal height, weight, age, and smoking status. Linear regression, ridge regression, robust regression, lasso regression, elastic net regression, polynomial regression, stochastic gradient descent, random forest regressor, SVM regressor, and ANN models were utilized. The models were evaluated based on the statistical parameters, such as MAE, RMSE, R 2 score, and explained variance score. The results reveal that the linear regression model outperformed the others by achieving a minimal MAE and RMSE scores of 8.658248 and 11.801136, respectively, and a higher R 2 value of 0.010901 and explained variance score of 0.021675.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Harmful and dangerous factors of professional activity of employees of an electric locomotive repair enterprise are described and their significance in deteriorating health and increasing the risk of premature aging is shown. The results of experimental determination of the level of health (reserves) of organs and systems of the body and stress resistance of representatives of the control group and workers of the electric locomotive assembly shop are presented. During the experiment, questionnaire methods were used, a computer program for heart rate variability according to the Bayevsky method, the calculation of biological age and the risk of developing premature aging was carried out according to the Voitenko method. According to the survey data, the surveyed workers showed signs of overwork and deterioration in the activity of the cardiovascular, respiratory and immune systems, as well as a deterioration in stress resistance according to the value of the regulation system tension index (INSR) according to Baevsky. On the basis of the conducted studies, a conclusion was made about the need for systematic express monitoring of the health status of workers exposed to adverse factors of professional activity in order to reduce the risk of developing occupational and professionally caused diseases and accelerated aging. The article also provides a set of health-improving measures, the positive impact of which on working capacity, quality of life and professional longevity has been proven in the course of our own experiment. These results are aimed at maintaining a healthy and able-bodied human resources potential and will ensure for many years the possibility of maintaining high labor productivity at the enterprises of the Russian transport complex.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Plantain has been reported to be rich in β-carotene, phenolics, and hydroxycinnamic acid, as well as resistant starch and fibre. Studies on the therapeutic properties of plantains date back to about two decades ago when the anti-ulcerative property of plantains was discovered. Its potential to mitigate hyperglycaemia, acute pancreatitis, and protein oxidation in both kidney and liver were later reported. It is unfortunate that these potential benefits of plantains are yet to be maximised for the acclaimed health benefits as well as for food and nutritional securities. Industrial production of plantains is extremely limited, especially in Africa, where plantains are commonly associated with household consumption. Interestingly, different parts of plantains are used as adsorbents for managing environmental waste pollutants. A holistic understanding of plantains as functional foods based on the abundant bioactive compounds as well as inherent nutraceutical properties could spur their increased production globally. This chapter aims to draw attention to the bioactive components and useful ingredients in the pulp and peel of plantains.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Health care is a data-intensive system, where a large amount of data is generated regularly. Patient data is used to provide health services, manage health research, generate medical records, and process medical insurance claims. Therefore, this critical data of patients must be secured. Blockchain technology can be used to maintain security in such smart healthcare systems. While these days, the focus of the blockchain applications in practice has been to build spreadsheets that include visual tokens, the momentum of this emerging technology has now expanded to provide security in the healthcare systems too. With the growth of the popularity of healthcare Internet of things (IoT), it is important to know that this technology-based smart system can be supported with blockchain technology for providing security services to all related players viz., patients, doctors, insurance companies, and researchers. This paper presents a state-of-the-art survey on securing healthcare IoT systems with blockchain technology.',\n",

In dit hoofdstuk wordt zorgtechnologie als de overkoepelende term gezien van zowel zorg op afstand of zogenaamde e-health als ondersteunende technologie; dat hulpmiddelen en diensten rondom hulpmiddelen omvat. Een ergotherapeut kan zes verschillende rollen vervullen ten aanzien van zorgtechnologie, namelijk: gebruiker, trainer, adviseur, ontwerper, implementeerder en onderzoeker. Binnen elke rol wordt uitgelegd wat een ergotherapeut in deze rol kan betekenen voor personen, organisaties en gemeenschappen, met een vraag of uitdaging in het dagelijks handelen en welke bijdrage technologie kan leveren. Mogelijke toepassingen worden kort beschreven zoals robotica, domotica, extended reality . Ook de procesbeschrijving rond hulpmiddelenzorg en de diverse assessment-instrumenten die ontwikkeld zijn voor de evaluatie van zorgtechnologie worden beschreven.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'While the COVID-19 pandemic in some way affected every person and enterprise on the planet, the temporary hollowing out of concentrated economic, political, and cultural agglomerations in cities dealt a devastating and potentially enduring blow to the public transit systems that depend on them for so many of their customers. This chapter draws on a survey of 72 U.S. public transit systems and semi-structured interviews with 12 transit agency staff, both conducted in the late summer and early fall of 2020, to consider how the pandemic shocked the transit industry at the outset, and how the industry adapted to deliver transit services. We find that: transit agencies adapted quickly, and many of their changes are now standard operating procedure; the pandemic tended to affect large and small transit agencies differently; transit’s role as a social service provider took on increased visibility and importance; and financial collapse has been averted, but funding shortfalls may become a pressing issue in the years ahead when federal emergency funding runs out. We conclude that while transit systems have adapted remarkably to dramatic change and that federal funding has largely forestalled fiscal crises, the longer term future of public transit in the U.S. remains very uncertain.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Understanding patient preferences for drug therapies can help to inform drug development, reimbursement decisions by insurers, and shared decision-making by patients and clinicians. Typically, preferences are assessed using lengthy and costly studies involving qualitative analysis of interviews and focus groups along with complex stated preference surveys. We have developed a more efficient method that allows users (e.g. health services researchers, drug developers, or market researchers) to assess patient preferences semi-automatically from online patient-generated text using a weakly supervised aspect-based sentiment analysis pipeline. To facilitate users’ ability to generate new insights on patient preferences using our system, we have developed a dedicated user interface, which we present here.

       "  'abstract': 'This is a presentation of how I remember the first steps of Vision Zero, the Swedish reorientation of traffic safety policy that took place from the mid-1990s and onwards. It is not an objective text that would be impossible to write as one of the initiators of the policy change. But it brings up some of the steps of the process and presents some hypotheses on how policy change might happen. It is claimed that there was no planned process, not even an ideology or well-developed idea, behind VZ from the very beginning. But there were opportunities and events where one thing led to another. The most fundamental being the immediate acceptance from the Swedish Minister of Infrastructure back in January 1995. The most prominent ideas behind VZ are that firstly safety is a matter of how the providers of the road transport system design and build and manage the system. The second idea is that a professional provider cannot trade off the citizens’ life and health for benefits to the society and its citizens. The underlying hypothesis is that tradition and road traffic rules for the road users have been used as an excuse for not undertaking necessary system changes and modifications. The users have always been blamed for crashes and its consequences by the legal system as well as general approach from the society. The last part of the paper reflects on what is necessary to do in the future to eradicate amateurism, populism, and trade-offs from the road traffic safety field. Maybe a “duty of care” legislation needs to be introduced, protecting the citizen from poor design and operations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Commencing in the 1990s, social work is a relatively new profession in Ukraine, and the process of its professionalization is ongoing. This chapter aims to introduce the international community to the status of military social work in Ukraine. The specific focus of the chapter will be on describing the existing national context of social work in the military, as well as on identifying specific prerequisites for the uniformed and civilian social work establishment to address the needs of military service members, veterans, and their families. The chapter will also assist in understanding the needs of active-duty personnel and veterans associated with the ongoing armed conflict in Ukraine, as well as governmental and non-governmental responses including different programs, projects, volunteer, and veteran movements. Prerequisites, and the most promising future directions of military social work development in the country, are also discussed.\\xa0It is highlighted that this chapter was written prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Increasingly, consumers are paying attention to healthier food diets, “healthy” food attributes (such as “freshness”, “naturalness” and “nutritional value”), and the overall sustainability of production and processing methods. Other significant trends include a growing demand for regional and locally produced/supplied and less processed food. To meet these demands, food production and processing need to evolve to preserve the raw material and natural food properties while ensuring such sustenance is healthy, tasty, and sustainable. In parallel, it is necessary to understand the influence of consumers’ practices in maintaining the beneficial food attributes from purchasing to consumption. The whole supply chain must be resilient, fair, diverse, transparent, and economically balanced to make different food systems sustainable. This chapter focuses on the role of dynamic value chains using biodiverse, underutilised crops to improve food system resilience and deliver foods with good nutritional and health properties while ensuring low environmental impacts, and resilient ecosystem functions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Driving a vehicle on a road is inevitably associated with the generation of tire-abrasion particles. Annually, nearly six million tons of this material are released into the environment globally. Most of the tire debris is encrusted to variable extent with other particles, which are derived from brake and road wear, as well as from soil. First emitted into the atmosphere or deposited onto the road surface, these tire-abrasion particles are subsequently transported by wind and water to different environmental compartments, whereby road runoff plays a crucial role in the distribution. Once in the environment, these particles interact with air, light, and water, which triggers degradation and concomitant release of crucial tire components, such as zinc and various organic tire additives. The tire-abrasion particles and the leachates derived from them during their degradation in the environment can cause various biological responses in aquatic and terrestrial biota, as determined by numerous ecotoxicological studies. Challenges exist with the identification and quantification of the abundance of tire-abrasion particles in the various environmental compartments, the determination of their toxicity, and with the reduction of both their emission and immission into the environment.',\n",

The authors review data in the most recently published international business journals as well as secondary sources to determine how contextual factors impact women’s participation and success in leadership positions. Economic, social, cultural, and political contextual factors are reviewed. The authors compare the differences in leadership opportunities and challenges for women in the business sector between China and the selected non-Asian countries: Australia, Brazil, Sweden, and the United States. This chapter further explores how current Chinese women have become more empowered within the Asian/Chinese context. Some common contextual catalysts for women’s success and prominent contextual impediments are presented. The chapter is concluded with many implications for practice and research.',\n",

In general, the accident frequency rate is higher in the Finnish food industry than other manufacturing industry. Hence, there is a need to implement further actions to prevent occupational accidents and improve health and safety at work in the food industry. To guide these actions, up-to-date information on accidents at work is needed. This study descriptively analyzed the circumstances, causes, and consequences of accidents at work in the Finnish food industry between 2016 and 2020 (n\\u2009=\\u20098481). The data were retrieved from the Finnish official national occupational accident database. The results reveal that most of the injuries were minor, such as wounds and superficial injuries, resulting in 0‒3\\xa0days of incapacity for the work. The most accident-prone activities were handling objects, movement, and carrying loads by hand. Hands were the most exposed body parts. The most common causes of injury were related to movement and slipping, stumbling, and falling. Focusing on these factors to may support the food industry in preventing and reducing the number of accidents at work.',\n",

The software utilizes real-time telemetry data and the monitoring rules saved in the spacecraft to judge the on-board health state of the spacecraft. When the state violates the monitoring rules, an event report will be sent back to the ground automatically and, in turn, a process of coping with the anomaly will be activated automatically.

       "  'abstract': 'In this paper, the temperature scaling approach (TS) for temperature compensation of guided ultrasonic waves (GUW) is presented. In many previous works, it could be observed that the amplitudes of the GUW change with temperature. In the TS approach, it is assumed that for each transducer configuration several functions $$M\\\\left( f,T\\\\right) $$ M f , T exist that describe the change of the maximum amplitude depending on the frequency f and the temperature T . It is also assumed that several functions $$F\\\\left( f,T\\\\right) $$ F f , T exist that describe the changes of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) from the amplitude containing the maximum value of the measurement. Furthermore, it is assumed that the functions $$M\\\\left( f,T\\\\right) $$ M f , T and $$F\\\\left( f,T\\\\right) $$ F f , T also depend on the medium in which the GUW propagate, so that a change of the medium results in a change of the functions. This means that these functions can be used for damage detection. GUW data from the http://openguidedwaves.de/ database were analyzed with the TS approach. Data from a carbon fiber reinforced polymer plate with a temperature range from 20\\xa0 $$^\\\\circ $$ ∘ C to 60\\xa0 $$^\\\\circ $$ ∘ C were analyzed for different actuator-sensor paths and compared with position-dependent artificial defects. To determine the functions $$M\\\\left( f,T\\\\right) $$ M f , T and $$F\\\\left( f,T\\\\right) $$ F f , T , polynomials were fitted to the measured values of the maxima and full FWHM. The TS analysis showed a detect ability of the artificial defects over the entire temperature range.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The IoT, which is referred to as the “new industrial revolution,” has revolutionized the interactions between the governments and their surrounding world with the virtual world and technology because of the change in life, work, entertainment, and travel. IoT applications have influenced every person’s life and have changed human applications more conveniently. Most well-known IoT applications are health care systems, transportation, military, structural monitoring, and disaster recovery. These applications have bounded to each other, and the human intervention is reduced in all aspects in a smart city. Decision-making is done with the aid of machine/deep learning algorithms. The quality of life is improved due to the smart city applications and the great improvement that is achieved in deep learning. In this chapter, we aim to review some smart applications in this regard. The innovations, challenges, and upcoming changes in smart city applications attract many researchers and it is still a hot topic. We discuss some challenges in smart city applications and their influence on everyday life.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Monitoring and managing the health of critical structures has been identified as a key approach to define performance parameters in realizing the next generation of industrial manufacturing, production and operation (Industry 4.0 principles in Europe). However, stakeholders today are facing challenges in handling the data acquired from the sensors along with the complexities in post processing for improved productivity and safety standards. Although the currently available state-of-the-art sensors are capable of collection and communication of structural health related aspects, the complexity associated with the data processing scheme and effective wireless transmission of large data-volumes for real-time decision making hinders its value-add for industrial applications. In this context, we propose an early warning system, using smart multi-sensors, with the capability for on-board processing and data logging. Although the developed system could be applied for a wide variety of use-cases, across several industries (including aerospace, automotive and marine), we employ the same for monitoring the health of critical infrastructure elements in this study. Along with shorter decision making timelines, the developed solution would ensure increased cost savings due to a higher degree of automation, increased efficiency, robustness and safety of the critical structures and/or systems.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This study systematically assess the paradigm shift in consumer behavior during Pre-COVID and COVID scenarios using social media (data collected from Facebook, Twitter, Pin Interest, YouTube, Reviews & Forums, and Google Plus) platforms. The study analyzed 523,764 and 1,054,794 social media responses in Pre-COVID and COVID eras respectively. Due to the large volume of the data, for Pre-COVID era, responses from August to December 2019 were considered. For COVID era, responses from January to June 2020 were taken into the account. The organic food categories, considered in the study were Snacks, Fruits, Vegetables, Beers & Alcohol, Meat, Flour, Dairy, Cereals & Savories, Health Drink, Noodles & Fast Food, Dessert and Pizza & Pasta. In the study three-stage filtering for Sentiment Analysis was performed (86.4% accuracy\\xa0achieved) using Natural Language Processing, Manual analysis of sentiment and Bi-Directional Encoder Representations from Transforms based model. It was concluded that in Pre-COVID era, people were less aware about the health benefits of organic food but in COVID era, the awareness level of consumers rose exponentially about various organic food categories, especially about processed organic food categories and benefits of raw organic food categories. In Pre-COVID Era, consumers were mainly focused on fresh fruits and vegetables. In COVID Era, food categories like Dairy, Meat and Vegetables were at the top. Fruits, snacks, beer and alcohol were also in high demand. While analyzing the Pre-COVID and COVID scenarios, we observed a shift in\\xa0consumer behaviour from raw organic food categories towards processed and semi-processed organic food categories. Organic noodles & fast food, dessert and health drinks still remained as the least preferred food categories. The study is unique since it provides a macro and micro view of shift in consumer behavior preferences in Pre-COVID and COVID eras using social media at various geographical locations worldwide. This research will help manufacturers of organic food to reshape their existing consumer behavior and market penetration strategies. It will also help in new product designing and increasing the consumer base\\xa0both at the local and global levels.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Despite being unprepared for the COVID-19 outburst in spring 2020, Czechia did particularly well in handling the first weeks of the pandemic. However, the government which was the key actor in the whole process did not use the following summer months to prepare the country for autumn and winter, and the Czech success turned into a catastrophe that continued until Spring 2021. This chapter argues that this undesired development was caused particularly by a combination of cabinet being cradled by success in spring 2020 and its general populist tendencies. This mixture led to the underestimation of the risks associated with the autumn months by the government causing its unwillingness to adopt suitable but unpopular decisions in later stages of the pandemic. As a consequence, the government quickly lost the credibility among the general public whose compliance with the often confusing and problematic rules was constantly decreasing especially if compared to the spring 2020\\xa0months.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Autonomous Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has been introduced in composite structures extensively over the last decade in an attempt to proactively monitor potential internal defects, however active/passive control of their integrity status still remains a challenge. In this work, a novel, non-Newtonian multifunctional polymer with unique active/passive capabilities is proposed for impact protection and SHM of composite laminate structures. This Polyboro siloxane(PBS)-based polymer with unique shear-dependant energy absorption characteristics, owed to a phase transition occurrence within its polymeric network, was utilised as scaffold for ferromagnetic iron particles which enabled the manufacturing of the multifunctional matrix for Glass Fibres Reinforced Polymer (GFRP). The iron particles were positioned in the polymer matrix, which was reinforced with glass fibres and employed as outer ply of a laminate structure. Their presence enables a dual functionality of the multifunctional layer: firstly, in the presence of a magnetic field, triggers the phase transition of the polymeric network offering protection to the laminate in case of impacts, and secondly, postimpact allows for the assessment of the internal integrity of the component, acting as an embedded heat source for active Infrared (IR) Thermography. The ability of the iron particles to initiate the phase transition was investigated by means of Low Velocity Impact in the presence/absence of a magnetic field and the laminates were then examined by means of induction thermography, for the evaluation of the internal damage. Results revealed that iron particles in the presence of a magnetic field led to an enhanced protection of the composite laminates, significantly reducing the extent of the internal damage. This novel, low-cost multifunctional layer provides a unique solution for the protection of composite materials, addressing their inherent weak resistance in out-of-plane direction and providing affordable SHM, thus opening new perspectives for smart structural materials which are in great demand in engineering sectors.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Norway has performed well in handling the COVID-19 pandemic, keeping both infections and deaths lower than in most other countries at the same time as it avoided the most intrusive regulatory measures. The government’s management of the COVID-19 pandemic played out in a context of low politicization illustrated by absent of mass polarization, a cooperative society and a cooperative political elite. The policy measures were informed by a suppression strategy based on the precautionary principle of giving first priority to life and health issues, and adaptive collaborative and pragmatic approach as the pandemic developed. Adding to this, a lot of resources, generous economic compensation packages, a big welfare state, a professional bureaucracy and hospital system, a trustworthy crisis communication with the public and a high level of citizens’ trust in government all contributed to the well-performing Norwegian crisis management. This illustrates that both governance capacity and governance legitimacy as well as leadership matter for a well-performing crisis management.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In past 20\\xa0years, it has been told us to take nutrient-rich food for maintaining good health. Recently, it is studied that nutrient is responsible for the modification of gene and protein expression and at last influences cellular and organismal metabolism. Nutritional genomics, i.e., nutrigenomics, is behind the alteration of gene–diet interaction. The diverse tissue and organ-specific results of bioactive dietary components consist of gene expression patterns (transcriptome), enterprise of the chromatin (epigenome), protein expression patterns, inclusive of post-translational modifications (proteome), as nicely as metabolite profiles (metabolome). Nutrigenomics goes deeper, using molecular tools to become aware of how vitamins and bioactive meal compounds alter the DNA transcription and translation process, affecting the expression of genes that alter essential metabolic pathways, which may also finally affect health results. Ultimately, nutrigenomics will give the gene-nutrient information for restoring health and preventing nutrient-related disease. In this chapter, we provide an overview of nutrigenomics, gene–nutrient interactions, role on human health, and future opportunities.',\n",

Thus, the prime objective of this study is to assess the effects of herbicide application on the quality of tea and tea soil in terms of its toxic heavy metal contamination. The microwave digestion system and atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS) were mainly used to determine the levels of metal contaminations of fresh tea leaves/black tea and tea soils. The results revealed that Zn, Fe, and Pb of soils of herbicides applied tea land are significantly higher (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) than the soils of herbicides-free tea land. Further, the Pb levels of green tea are slightly higher (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in herbicide-treated land. Ultimately it can be concluded that the long-term application of herbicides in tea plantations significantly affects the environment and human health. Also, it was reviewed that herbicides free integrated weed management (HFIWM) methods provide significant advantages that chemical weeding in terms of the sustainability of the tea industry in Sri Lanka.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The growing need for assessing the integrity of aging monumental structures by means of cost-effective and not-destructive techniques has driven significant scientific interest in vibration-based structural health monitoring (SHM) procedures, allowing to track changes in selected damage-sensitive structural parameters. However, the evaluation of a healthy or damaged state from the acquired monitoring data is often a data-driven process that can be subjected to a large amount of uncertainty, resulting in false positives and false negatives. Hence, the main idea behind this work focuses on handling the main issues related to the uncertainty management by exploiting the aggregation of different sources of information. In this context, this study is aimed at detecting and locating structural damages in monumental structures with the aid of a data fusion approach including vibration-based system identification, Bayesian-based finite element (FE) model updating and visual inspections. As a preliminary step, potential damage-sensitive sections are defined on the basis of nonlinear static analyses (NLSA) performed on a calibrated FE model and/or engineering judgment (EJ). Then, a surrogate model is established enabling to transfer knowledge from the monitoring data to the updated numerical models and to solve the inverse problem aimed at deriving the posterior statistics of the uncertain parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by using 1-year of recorded data acquired in a monumental structure named Consoli Palace, located in Umbria, central Italy, a region characterized by high seismic hazard. The palace has been continuously monitored by the Authors since 2017 using dynamic, static and environmental sensors.',\n",

This chapter proposes and studies the new concept of “Artificial Self-recovery” (AS), which refers to that machines can suppress and eliminate failures by itself during operation, from “healing” to “self-recovery”.

       "  'abstract': 'A technological solution for the management of diabetes in people who require intensive insulin therapy has been sought for decades. The last 10 years have seen substantial growth in devices that can be integrated into clinical care. Driven by the availability of reliable systems for continuous glucose monitoring, we have entered an era in which insulin delivery through insulin pumps can be modulated based on sensor glucose data. Over the past few years, regulatory approval of the first automated insulin delivery (AID) systems has been granted, and these systems have been adopted into clinical care. Additionally, a community of people living with type 1 diabetes has created its own systems using a do-it-yourself approach by using products commercialised for independent use. With several AID systems in development, some of which are anticipated to be granted regulatory approval in the near future, the joint Diabetes Technology Working Group of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes and the American Diabetes Association has created this consensus report. We provide a review of the current landscape of AID systems, with a particular focus on their safety. We conclude with a series of recommended targeted actions. This is the fourth in a series of reports issued by this working group. The working group was jointly commissioned by the executives of both organisations to write the first statement on insulin pumps, which was published in 2015. The original authoring group was comprised by three nominated members of the American Diabetes Association and three nominated members of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. Additional authors have been added to the group to increase diversity and range of expertise. Each organisation has provided a similar internal review process for each manuscript prior to submission for editorial review by the two journals. Harmonisation of editorial and substantial modifications has occurred at both levels. The members of the group have selected the subject of each statement and submitted the selection to both organisations for confirmation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The acronym AFAB refers to those persons who have been ‘Assigned Female at Birth’. AFAB persons who, later in life, do not identify as female, are said to present a condition named ‘Gender Incongruence’ (GI). They might identify as men, or as non-binary. Persons presenting the condition of GI might experience a Gender Dysphoria (GD), which is defined as the discomfort due to the mismatch between their anatomical characteristics and the gender in which they are self-identifying. Thus, patients with GD are requesting surgical procedure (s) in order to align one’s body—mostly chest and genitals—to best match with one’s identity. The final aim is to reduce one’s dysphoria. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health currently publishes a series of guidelines, which are named as Standards of Care, for patients presenting GI. In this chapter, we provide an overview on surgical planning and technics, and possible outcomes for Chest-Contouring-Mastectomy (CMM) and genital surgery (metoidioplasty and phalloplasty). Nearly all trans men, and many non-binary AFAB individuals might seek for CCM; the surgery mostly consists in (partial) removal of the breast glandular tissue and, often, reduction of the Nipple-Areola-Complex. Some AFAB individuals with GI are also interested in penis reconstruction: metoidioplasty consists in the surgical enlargement of an hypertrophic clitoris, while phalloplasty consists in the construction of a penis with either larger, local, or distant flaps (including free flaps). Limitations and complications of the different surgical approaches are also presented.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This paper highlights the impact on education due to the corona virus/COVID 2019 crisis across the world. Over, 100 million students in India will be phasing out this issue from 2019 onward. The impact of this pandemic is not only on education but even on all sectors of the world. The enforced lockdown is having a bad effect on the students’ lives. Due to the pandemic, students as well as educational institutions have to attain technology in the education sector. This paper is going to use the online survey method to gather the responses of some 20 schools and 10 college students from different states in India by using self-developed questionnaires to analyze the effect of online-based learning on students. We compare the different surveys of other countries to find out what major steps help in the education sector of those countries. Using Python discovered that 90% of students are currently dealing with health issues, and 70% are not receiving financial assistance. Only, 30% of students are found proficient in digital skills, and many of them feel a lack of teacher–student interaction. We found some negative and positive impacts of COVID-19 on students. Also, we are suggesting some solutions for the educational sector to opt for ICT at a low cost.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This chapter draws together a set of recent findings which demonstrate a statistically robust relationship between green space and wellbeing of prisoners and prison staff. Extending prior prison-level qualitative studies which find that nature contact influences prisoners’ self-reported wellbeing, this work used GIS mapping to generate a new prison greenspace dataset, capturing—for a cross-section of prisons in England and Wales—the percentage of greenspace within their perimeters. Econometric estimations confirm that greenspace fosters prisoner and prison staff wellbeing, in that there are lower levels of self-harm and violence, and lower levels of staff sickness absence, in prisons with more greenspace. These relationships persist when prison size, type, age, staffing level, and level of crowding are controlled for. The findings have the potential to significantly influence future prison design. In addition to summarising these findings, the chapter also reports exploratory investigations on whether and how the inclusion of prison layout type might impact on the wellbeing effects of greenspace.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background Adherence to evidence-based guidelines for gastric cancer is low, particularly at the hospital level, despite a strong association with improved overall survival (OS). We aimed to evaluate patterns of hospital and regional adherence to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for gastric cancer. Methods Using the National Cancer Database (2004–2015), we identified patients with stage I–III gastric cancer. Hospital-level guideline adherence was calculated by dividing the patients who received guideline adherent care by the total patients treated at that hospital. OS was estimated for each hospital. Associations between adherence, region, and survival were compared using mixed-effects, hierarchical regression. Results Among 576 hospitals, the median hospital guideline adherence rate was 25% (range 0–76%) and varied significantly by region ( p \\xa0=\\xa00.001). Adherence was highest in the Middle Atlantic (29%) and lowest in the East South Central region (19%); hospitals in the New England, Middle Atlantic, and East North Central regions were more likely to be guideline adherent than those in the East South Central region (all p \\xa0<\\xa00.05), after adjusting for patient and hospital mix. Most (35%) of the adherence variation was attributable to the hospital. Median 2-year OS varied significantly by region. After adjusting for hospital and patient mix, hazard of mortality was 17% lower in the Middle Atlantic (hazard ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.74–0.90) relative to the East South Central region, with most of the variation (54%) attributable to patient-level factors. Conclusions Hospital-level guideline adherence for gastric cancer demonstrated significant regional variation and was associated with longer OS, suggesting that efforts to improve guideline adherence should be directed toward lower-performing hospitals.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Considering that more than half of the world's population is economically active, safe working environments are vital to improving their overall quality of life. Accident research aims to understand accidents, characterise them, and search for their causes to implement preventive actions. Thus, this study will search for relevant information about the characterisation of accidents at work in the manufacturing industry pursuing their prevention. Following the guidelines of PRISMA Statement, this review aims to obtain relevant information about the portrayal of accidents at work in the manufacturing industry. Three databases, namely: Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore, are used to develop a data search based on the defined keywords. A total of 6 publications are included in the scoping review. Topics such as sample characteristics, context assessment, research methods and major study conclusions are analysed. Accidents at work were studied in different manufacturing companies. The main types of accidents found were: “falls”, “caught in, on and between”, and “got cut”. The top causes for accidents were: “human element”; “nature of work”; “poor management” and “equipment”. Proactive actions such as training, effective leadership, equipment management and work reorganisation are recommended to identify risk situations upstream.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Human pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are a class of chemicals that range from medications to cleaning agents, showing diverse chemical properties. These chemicals have been placed in a variety of products, some of which are available over the counter and are commonly used. Since many PPPCPs enter the environment they have been commonly identified as contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). Many PPCPs are released form households where they enter the municipal waste stream and ultimately enter a wastewater treatment facility (WWTF). Researchers have characterized the presence of PPCPs through the waste stream and treatment facilities and ultimately in aquatic and terrestrial environments impacted by wastewater treatment end products. In comparison with parent PPCPs, transformation products (TPs) of these compounds are poorly characterized in the same environments. However, mounting evidence suggests that understanding TPs is as critical to understanding the fate and effects of PPCPs as the parent compound. Human metabolites of many PPCPs are known, but TPs of PPCPs can be produced in WWTFs and after be released in the natural environment. PPCPs that are in WWTFs are commonly transformed by both biotic and abiotic processes and not removed from the water system but released along with the TPs into surface waters, that may be used for municipal drinking water downstream or increasingly used as a source of non-potable water for agricultural uses. Some PPCPs and TPs can partition into the sludge phase during wastewater treatment, with a large portion of sludge produced being land-applied as a soil amendment (biosolids). The effects on the environment at times are difficult to quantify because the repercussions can be far reaching and there is a great need to elucidate the pathways and TPs formed as well as the effects on the biome.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Modelling generic size feature of delamination, like area or length, has long been considered in the literature for damage prognosis in composites through specific models describing damage state evolution with load cycles or time. However, the delamination shape has never been considered, despite that it contains more damage information like the delamination area, center, and boundary for structural safety evaluation. In this context, this paper develops a novel particle filter-based framework for delamination shape prediction. To this end, the delamination image is discretized by a mesh, where control points are defined as intersections between the grid lines and the boundary of the delamination. A parametric data-driven function maps each point position as a function of the load cycles and is initially fitted on a sample test. Then, a particle filter is independently implemented for each node whereby to predict their future positions along the mesh lines, thus allowing delamination shape progression estimates. The new framework is demonstrated with reference to experimental tests of fatigue delamination growth in composite panels with ultrasonics C-scan monitoring.',\n",

About 170 million people in the world are affected by long-term exposure to arsenic-contaminated groundwater. Exposure of plants to arsenic, even at low concentrations, causes many major morphological, physiological, and biochemical disturbances. The traditional membrane filtration method, reverse osmosis method, precipitation method, ion exchange method, coagulation and flocculation method are commonly used remediation methods for As-polluted water, but these are expensive. Using perennial woody vegetation to remediate and stabilize heavy metal pollution such as arsenic is an efficient, environmental friendly and sustainable method.

       "  'abstract': 'Microcontrollers are becoming popular in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems, as they can manage sensors, process data and meet requirements compliant with the cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) paradigms. Similarly, micro electro-mechanical system (MEMS) sensors are spreading for monitoring applications, given their appealing costs. Considering the importance of data for a SHM-targeted decision-making process, a conscious use of these technologies requires a deeper analysis from a metrological point of view, to ensure reliability and robustness of the provided data. Consequently, in a multi-node sensing architecture, concepts like sensitivity of each node or data synchronization becomes of uttermost importance, especially if modal parameters extraction is sought. This paper is intended as a warning for designers of SHM monitoring architectures: can we simply replace standard sensing devices with low-cost systems and expect they perform as well as their “stronger brothers”? The answer to this question is tentatively provided by discussing results obtained in a testing campaign performed on some reinforced concrete beams, dynamically tested through two different monitoring systems: a standard, high-performance system exploiting high-sensitivity piezoelectric accelerometers and a low-cost MEMS digital accelerometers-based one, not coupled to a high performance data acqusition system, rather. Modal parameters are considered as the target measure to assess the performance of the two systems.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Human flourishing has been defined as a subjective and holistic sentiment related to growth, prosperity, fulfillment, and sense of life completeness. This definition may lead to think that human flourishing is unique to people living under privileged circumstances of health and well-being, whereas people with life limiting illnesses are deprived from this possibility. In this paper, we reflect on the idea of human flourishing in the context of palliative care. Although people with advanced illnesses experience in a special manner the limits of human life and vulnerability, and the final stages may inevitably imply considerable suffering, we argue that it is also possible to experience this final stage as an opportunity for personal growth, to live it in full accordance with one's beliefs and values, and to reestablish a profound connection to oneself and to others. In sum, the end of life may also be a time of human flourishing.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Rice is the staple diet for more than 3.5 billion people around the world. Elevation of arsenic (As) in paddy rice ecosystems has become an environmental, economic, and public concern due to its adverse consequences on global rice production, food safety, and human health. Mining exploitation, weathering of As-bearing minerals, dissolution of aquifer sediments, and As-contaminated groundwater irrigation have extensively contributed to the contamination of paddy soil by As in high levels. Speciation, mobility and sequestration of As in paddy soil–water interfaces are controlled by iron (Fe) plaque formation, redox sensitive mineral surfaces (Fe and Mn), organic matter and competing substances (PO $$_{4}^{3-}$$ and Si(OH) 4 ). During flooding season, paddy soil porewater is contaminated with high concentrations of inorganic As species, particularly by more toxic arsenite (As(III)) as result of arsenate (As(V)) reduction under anaerobic conditions. Microorganisms play a crucial role in As speciation dynamics promoting redox transformation, methylation and volatilization processes. Various metabolic pathways, including As(V) reduction, As(III) efflux, and As(III)-thiol complexation govern As uptake, translocation, and loading into rice grains. The translocation of As from rice root to shoot leads to the accumulation of toxic As species in grains affecting rice quality and yield. The worst scenario of grain As is associated with the human exposure to high amounts of As via consumption of As-contaminated rice and related food products. Hence, this chapter provides an overview of (i) As speciation and transformation dynamics, (ii) As uptake mechanisms from root to shoot, (iii) As metabolic pathways over root, shoot and grain loading, and (iv) recommendations for future research. Such a widespread understanding of As dynamics in paddy rice ecosystems is crucial to develop sustainable As mitigation strategies and alleviate adverse impacts on global food safety and human health.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The paper studies the topological changes from before and after cointegration, for the natural frequencies of the Z24 Bridge. The second natural frequency is known to be nonlinear in temperature, and this will serve as the main focal point of this work. Cointegration is a method of normalising time series data with respect to one another - often strongly-correlated time series. Cointegration is used in this paper to remove effects from Environmental and Operational Variations, by cointegrating the first four natural frequencies for the Z24 Bridge data. The temperature effects on the natural frequency data are clearly visible within the data, and it is desirable, for the purposes of structural health monitoring, that these effects are removed. The univariate time series are embedded in higher-dimensional space, such that interesting topologies are formed. Topological data analysis is used to analyse the raw time series, and the cointegrated equivalents. A standard topological data analysis pipeline is enacted, where simplicial complexes are constructed from the embedded point clouds. Topological properties are then calculated from the simplicial complexes; such as the persistent homology. The persistent homology is then analysed, to determine the topological structure of all the time series.',\n",

A statistical model was developed, such that the time trend of the first eigenfrequencies of the building were modelled through the trend of the clinometer signals and the root mean square (RMS) of some of the accelerometers. This because it was observed that the clinometer signals and the acceleration RMSs are linked to different environmental variables. As examples: the changes of the static configuration of the building due to sun exposure can be described by clinometer signals and acceleration RMSs can take into account the effect of wind. The use of these signals and indexes simplifies the development of the predictive model, compared to the use of measured environmental quantities. The model showed good performances in foreseeing the trend of the first eigenfrequencies. This paper analyses how the reliability of the model, developed with data acquired in 2015–2016, has changed relying on new data acquired in 2021–2022.',\n",

Er is aandacht voor de transactionele relatie tussen persoon, context en dagelijks handelen en hoe de context aangrijpingspunten biedt aan ergotherapeuten om het dagelijks handelen van een persoon, systeem, organisatie of gemeenschap te optimaliseren. De context is steeds in ontwikkeling en ook dit heeft een invloed op de ergotherapiepraktijk.

       "  'abstract': 'The current network control system (NCS) cannot assess the system safety state in a timely, comprehensive, and accurate manner, which leads to serious security problems in NCS. Directing at the defects of existing security state assessment models for the NCS, a method of safety state assessment of the NCS based on the belief rule base (BRB) expert system is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the expert system of the BRB is used to combine qualitative knowledge with quantitative monitoring data. Then, the evidential reasoning\\xa0(ER) algorithm is used for knowledge reasoning, and the initial parameters of BRB model are optimized. Finally, taking the data of a gas NCS as an example, the experimental results illustrate that the assessment accuracy is higher than that of back propagation (BP) and support vector machines (SVM) evaluation models.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'With reports of 9.9\\xa0million people being infected with tuberculosis by WHO, there is a dire need to curtail the spread of tuberculosis. In spite of having faced many impediments like lack of certified radiologist and chest radiography hardware which are expensive, diagnosis of tuberculosis still remains undetected at early stage. Chest radiography is one of the earliest method of detection used and is an asset for diagnosis of TB especially in early stages of infection, in a resource limited setting as well as for differential diagnosis. In the times of artificial intelligence (AI), we can see many modern platforms for the development of Computer-aided detection (CAD) through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) and there are data coming forth indicating their utilization to the maximum. These approaches involve in hospital settings for examining the diseases through clinical aetiology as well as X-ray images of the patient. Presently, efforts and strategies are being framed and articulated to bring more accuracy adopting the use of the AI and machine learning approaches for the diagnosis of TB. This survey provides an insight to the application and use of CAD for the diagnosis of TB.',\n",

In this chapter, we describe this meaning systems framework and summarize each subfield’s key meaning-related areas of focus, methods, and applications. We then highlight the convergences and divergences in these key areas of both subfields. We conclude that meaning is a unifying construct around which future theory and empirical research on PP and PRS can coalesce, and we propose some specific directions for a fruitful integration of these two subfields.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Structural health monitoring (SHM) of bridges is of paramount importance as they serve the necessity of safeguarding the crucial transportation networks. Damage detection is one of the major tasks in structural health monitoring. In this paper, a technique to detect and locate the damage in the bridge structure is presented. The proposed technique employs the bridge influence surfaces constructed from the responses of the structure collected at limited points. The changes in the influence surfaces under healthy state and any unknown state of the bridge are used to evaluate the damage index. The traffic loads at any instant of time are simulated as point loads at random locations. Influence surfaces for acceleration measurement are considered in a novel way in this study. A single span T-beam slab bridge is used as a numerical example to showcase the efficiency of the proposed technique to identify the presence and the location of damage. The study carried out implies that these damage indices can serve as a reliable means for detecting and locating the damages on the bridges. This technique can also be used for vision-based SHM.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Australia does not have an exemplary track record regarding Indigenous Australians’ human rights and treatment. Moving forward past the colonial mechanisms since 1788 has proven difficult. Decolonizing practices in education include embedding Indigenous ways of learning. It is essential to include decolonizing practices in teacher education to allow preservice teachers, most of whom are non-Indigenous, to learn about the barriers that persist for Indigenous students and how to eliminate them. Although Indigenous people have been resilient in the face of adversity for so long, their resilience may be wearing thin, with circumstances and systems continuing to result in environments of social exclusion and inequity. This chapter examines a strength-based approach to educational practice and teacher education by exploring Indigenous resilience, standpoint theory, and cultural strength as tools to understand educational issues differently and consider how Indigenous voices and Indigenous decision-making might change systems. The movement of decolonization through initial teacher education includes using cultural responsiveness and a transformative learning style to create a better-informed workforce of teachers capable of ensuring a promising future for all Australians.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Vision rehabilitation aims to improve daily functioning in patients with chronic disabling vision impairments – low vision – by providing vision assistive equipment and teaching patients effective use of the equipment; teaching patients adaptations to obviate dependence on vision; modifications of the patient’s environment to improve visibility and increase safety; and psychosocial counseling and education to help patients cope with the stress of impaired vision. The interventions that constitute vision rehabilitation are tailored to each patient’s functional goals and personal preferences. This chapter describes the theory, structure, and mechanics of an adaptive patient-reported outcome measure – the Activity Inventory (AI). The AI was developed to identify each patient’s unique set of functional goals within a hierarchical framework, to specify the cognitive and motor activities ( i.e. , tasks in different functional domains) the patient customarily performs to achieve his or her personal goals, and to elicit ordinal patient ratings of the importance and difficulty of each goal and the difficulty of relevant subsidiary tasks under goals that meet or exceed defined importance and difficulty criteria. The theoretical assumptions of a Rasch psychometric model that is employed to estimate measures of the patient’s overall visual ability from goal difficulty ratings and ability in each functional domain from task difficulty ratings before and after vision rehabilitation are presented and the results for a large group of low vision patients are reviewed. This chapter then explores the issue of how individual patient preferences must be factored into the outcome measures to determine the utility of functional improvements from vision rehabilitation. A theoretical framework for incorporating the utility of individual vision rehabilitation outcomes is offered and its application to functional outcome data is demonstrated.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Artificial intelligence had the most significant leap in the last two decades. In health care, artificial intelligence can be applied to many different task solutions. One of the machine learning types is unsupervised learning, and the most known type of this is clustering. Scientific researches show that clustering algorithms can be applied to identify different diseases. However, although there are many new clustering algorithms, k-means, hierarchal agglomerative clustering, and k-modes methods are still the most widely used algorithms, as these are fast-acting and work well with specific datasets. This work aims to give a brief overview of machine learning and pay more attention to unsupervised machine learning and clustering. Briefly introduce the current clustering methods in the medical field and apply the clustering methods to different medical and non-medical datasets. Results showed that different methods work best for the different datasets, and there are no universal clustering methods for all datasets. Results showed that for the E. coli dataset, the best method tested was BIRCH, but for the cancer clustering, the dataset's best model was Gaussian mixture model.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'To maintain good air quality, the observation of pollution levels framework estimates a variety of air contaminants in various locations. In the current circumstances, it is the most desirable concern. The release of hazardous gases into the environment by businesses, vehicles, and other sources pollutes the air. These days, the level of pollution in the air has surpassed fundamental levels, and the amount of contamination in several major urban areas has exceeded the public authority’s air quality list criteria. It has a tremendous impact on a person’s health. With advances in machine learning technology, it is now possible to forecast the future of toxins based on historical data. In this paper, we described a device that can collect the current toxic gases. With the help of the previous records of toxic gases, we executed a computation using machine learning techniques to detect the contamination in the air. It would be a good idea to use machine learning to forecast the future contamination information. The information gathered is saved in an Excel document for further analysis. To collect contamination data, the respective sensors are used on Arduino.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Tensegrity is a network of bars and cables that maintains its structural integrity with tension present in its cables. Other than typical structural failure mechanisms, tensegrity may fail due to slacking of cables or buckling of bars. Real-life tensegrities are an assemblage of component modules. Large tensegrities require excessive computation for model-based structural health monitoring (SHM), which may sometimes make the problem ill-posed. Instead of the entire domain, only a substructure can be investigated explicitly. Substructures decouple the structure into independent components that can be monitored individually, provided the sub-domain interface is measured. Yet the integration of substructures within predictor-corrector model-based SHM algorithms needs special investigation from consistency, stability, and accuracy perspectives. To consider system uncertainties Bayesian filtering-based SHM approaches have been employed in this study. The need for interface measurement has been circumvented through an output injection approach. To increase computational efficiency, the domain decomposition approach is coupled with an interacting filtering-based approach that employs Ensemble Kalman filter (for state estimation) within an envelope of Particle filter (for health parameter estimation). This facilitates simultaneous estimation of state and parameters while enabling full parallelization capability. The proposed approach is tested on a six-stage tensegrity tower made of component simplex modules.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'For complex or large structures, the model updating process can be long and tedious and numerical methods can be computationally expensive. Hence, practitioners and researchers often resort to meta-modelling techniques when large problems are met. Even so, traditional methodologies, such as the Efficient Global Optimisation, can be slow and give sub-optimal results. This work proposes a new methodology for the model updating of numerical systems based on a novel Kriging approach for the scope of damage detection and quantification. The framework proposed is based on a global-local optimisation strategy recently developed by the authors, the refined Efficient Global Optimisation, herein used to tweak finite element models’ parameters to match the modal data extracted from a numerical system by using the residuals of the modified total modal assurance criterion. The main advantage to existing direct optimisation and meta-modelling frameworks is the more efficient use of computational effort for higher dimensional problems, which is verified with the use of a numerical system.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The limited knowledge that decision-makers have on the actual condition of civil structures and infrastructures complicates the management of seismic emergencies in urbanized areas. In this respect, Seismic Structural Health Monitoring (S 2 HM) can support decision-makers by providing real-time information on the structural condition. Nevertheless, S 2 HM information comes with a cost, and decision-makers have to decide if installing this type of system is worthy before the information is collected. In this paper, the benefit of S 2 HM in post-earthquake emergency management is assessed through the Value of Information (VoI) from Bayesian decision analysis. The VoI can be intended as the expected reduction in management costs resulting from monitoring information. If the VoI is higher than the cost of the monitoring system, the manager should install it. The methodology is applied to an exemplary building in a seismic area. It is demonstrated and discussed in the paper that the value of S 2 HM is strongly influenced by the decision scenario considered by the decision-maker. Specifically, it is shown that the VoI is particularly high when the S 2 HM information prevents unnecessary building evacuation and related losses of functionality.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'From a patient perspective, quality is about the total experience with a hospital, and includes not only medical quality, but also safety, empathy, service attitude, timeliness of care and information. This chapter addresses medical quality, and other quality aspects are discussed in other chapters. Every hospital should give patients access to quality data on the hospital website, so that patients can use this information when deciding which hospital to use. Indicators of medical quality are categorized into three types; structure, process, and outcome indicators. Structure includes factors such as number of beds, if there are specialized units in oncology, neurology, etc. Process indicators refer to documents and training standards. What matters the most for patients is data on health outcome, which is about change in health and complications to different treatments. Surprisingly few hospitals provide data on health outcome. There is a trend in the USA that outcome data is a requirement to get contract with health providers. Every clinical leader must be continuously updated on outcomes, including complication rates in their own unit, and must take action whenever needed. The hospital director must have access to outcome data for the entire hospital and how each clinical unit is performing.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background Increased time to surgery (TTS) is associated with decreased survival in patients with breast cancer. In early 2020, elective surgeries were canceled to preserve resources for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study attempts to measure the effect of mandated operating room shutdowns on TTS in patients with breast cancer. Patients and Methods This multicenter retrospective study compares 51 patients diagnosed with breast cancer at four public hospitals from January to June 2020 with 353 patients diagnosed from January 2017 to June 2018. Demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment regimens, and TTS for patients were statistically compared using parametric, nonparametric, and Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. Results Across all centers, there was a non-statistically significant increase in median TTS from 59 days in the pre-COVID period to 65 days during COVID ( p = 0.9). There was, however, meaningful variation across centers. At center A, the median TTS decreased from 57 to 51 days, center C’s TTS decreased from 83 to 64 days, and in center D, TTS increased from 42 to 129 days. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model for the pre-COVID versus COVID period effect on TTS, center was an important confounding variable, with notable differences for centers C and D compared with the referent category of center A ( p = 0.04, p = 0.006). Conclusion Data suggest that, while mandated operating room shutdowns did not result in an overall statistically significant delay in TTS, there were important differences between centers, indicating that, even in a unified multicenter public hospital system, COVID-19 may have resulted in delayed and potentially disparate care.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Agriculture, education and health systems have all progressed in the last decade. In times of pandemic crises like COVID-19, IoT and sensors play a critical role in the medical industry. Sensors and IoT-based health care gadgets have emerged as saviors for humanity in the face of resource shortage. Pulse oximeters are one such instrument that has been utilized widely during pandemics. Since a long time, pulse oximeters have been used to measure crucial body functions such as saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO 2 ) and pulse rate. They have been utilized to detect vital signs in patients in order to diagnose cardiac trouble early. However, oximeters have been widely utilized to detect SPO 2 levels in persons during the current pandemic. People are being attacked by the COVID-19, which is silently destroying their lungs, causing pneumonia and lowering oxygen levels to dangerously low levels. We propose a strategy in this study for detecting possibly vulnerable individuals by classifying them using data obtained from pulse oximeters. We propose an approach by involving volunteers who will record their vitals and share it with administrators on a regular basis.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The electromechanical impedance (EMI) technique assesses the health of structures in the frequency domain using piezo-actuators. EMI employs a high-frequency range and is a promising method to be used for the evaluation of lightweight structures. This study focuses on understanding the comparative sensitivity of different actuators to damage presence in additively manufactured (AM) polymer structures. An acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plate printed with horizontal layup was used for the investigation, where 2 PZT and 1 MFC actuators were fixed on the surface. Initially, damage was simulated by moving small magnets away from the actuators on both sides of the plate. Further, an impact damage was created at the center of the plate to compare the damage sensitivity of the three actuators. While both actuator types have shown a good damage sensitivity and coverage, a better sensitivity was observed in the case of the MFC actuator, as compared to PZTs. The attained damage index results of impedance and conductance are promising for the assessment of AM polymer structures.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Sultan Qaboos University Medical Education and Informatics Department was initially established as a Medical Education Unit in 2006. Its mission was to raise medical education standards by conducting research, teaching, and providing support in curriculum development, assessment, mentoring, student counseling, methods of teaching and learning, and information technology. In 2013, the unit was renamed the Medical Education and Informatics Unit (MEIU) to recognize the role of medical informatics. With few staff, MEIU activities depended mainly on the voluntary contributions of interested faculty and health professionals. In 2009, the MEIU took responsibility for the Clinical Skills Laboratory and, in 2013, appointed a student counselor. Following various challenges arising from its administrative status as a unit, the MEIU was converted to an official department in 2018.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Stress, commonly known by medical specialists as the silent killer, is the feeling of being unable to cope with mental or emotional pressure. The academic environment is reported to have high-stress levels due to their responsibilities. In particular, university academics demand more preparation and have to show commitment to their academic trajectory. In 2018, the Official Mexican government issued the Norm NOM-035-STPS-2018 focused on establishing the elements to identify, analyze and prevent psychosocial risk factors, and promote a favorable organizational environment in the workplace. This paper presents the NOM-035 Smart Manager, a system to support the application of the Norm NOM-035 for identifying the level of psychosocial risk factors in university academics, and it provides recommendations according to the risk factors levels. We evaluated the system with academic and HR staff from a public university. Our results show that the NOM-035 Smart Manager system has the potential to be integrated into the university systems as a diagnostic and monitoring tool for the psychological risk factors levels of academics.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Due to the increase in many tools, the relevance of data analytics in health data systems has been growing tremendously as a result of this exponential increase. As a result, it has also led to renewed confidence in the development of data-oriented frameworks for sensor learning in health information systems. With funding provided by artificial neural networks, researchers are looking into the possibility of creating a flexible machine that redefines the recent vision of artificial intelligence. As computing power and rapid processing of reality have increased, the rapid return on technology has often been compromised in terms of conceptual control and production of highly functional and semi-relevant input details that are mechanically designed tails. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of the relative relevance and potential downsides of the approach and its attitude as well as an advanced examination of fundamental learning in health information systems. Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges, security, and protection in healthcare systems with the use of machine learning approaches.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) comprises 57 participating states, including almost all the countries of the Western Balkans. The only country which is not a participating state of the OSCE in this region is the Republic of Kosovo. Kosovo announced its independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008, and a number of OSCE participating states soon after recognized its statehood. However, some participating states, including Serbia, Russia, Spain, Slovakia, Romania, Cyprus, and Greece, did not. International organizations, such as the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU), and the OSCE, have been engaged in post-conflict reconstruction of Kosovo since 1999. The aim of this article is to show the role of international community engagement in rebuilding the social security system in Kosovo since the end of the war of 1999. This analysis will enable the reader to understand not only the evolution of the social security system in Kosovo, but also the direct and indirect impact of international community on the social security of the states with limited recognition.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Depression is a common mental health disorder with large social and economic consequences. It can be costly and difficult to detect, traditionally requiring hours of assessment by a trained clinical. Recently, machine learning models have been trained to screen for depression with patient voice recordings collected during an interview with a virtual agent. To engage the patient in a conversation and increase the quantity of responses, the virtual interviewer asks a series of follow-up questions. However, asking fewer questions would reduce the time burden of screening for the participant. We, therefore, assess if these follow-up questions have a tangible impact on the performance of deep learning models for depression classification. Specifically, we study the effect of including the vocal and transcribed replies to one, two, three, four, five, or all follow-up questions in the depression screening models. We notably achieve this using unimodal and multimodal pre-trained transfer learning models. Our findings reveal that follow-up questions can help increase F1 scores for the majority of the interview questions. This research can be leveraged for the design of future mental illness screening applications by providing important information about both question selection and the best number of follow-up questions.',\n",

Wavelet functions are used as the functional basis family and the coefficients of projection of the time-varying model parameters are estimated via a maximum likelihood scheme. Damage detection and identification are tackled within a statistical decision making framework while appropriate thresholds are derived using pre-determined type I error probability levels. Both damage intersecting and non-intersecting, with respect to wave propagation, paths are considered in a multi-sensor aluminum plate in pitch-catch configuration. The method’s robustness, effectiveness, and limitations are discussed.

       "  'abstract': 'As technology progresses, artificial intelligence (AI) will be able to handle large datasets, reveal human essence computationally, and act like humans. AI technology has had a significant impact on the health-care business due to the need for precise diagnosis and enhanced patient care. Artificial intelligence has a long way to go in the fields of dentistry and medicine. We proposed three classes for dental classification in this paper: “cavity,” “filling,” and “implant.” The dataset is first preprocessed with a Gaussian filter before being extracted using a convolution entropy-based feature map. Eventually, to forecast the perfect match for the classification process, support value-based fusion matching is used in the classification phase. When compared to existing approaches, the accuracy is improved to 99.7%.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Mood disorders can be difficult to diagnose, evaluate, and treat. They involve affective and cognitive components, both of which need to be closely monitored over the course of the illness. Current methods like interviews and rating scales can be cumbersome, sometimes ineffective, and oftentimes infrequently administered. Even ecological momentary assessments, when used alone, are susceptible to many of the same limitations and still require active participation from the subject. Passive, continuous, frictionless, and ubiquitous means of recording and analyzing mood and cognition obviate the need for more frequent and lengthier doctor’s visits, can help identify misdiagnoses, and would potentially serve as an early warning system to better manage medication adherence and prevent hospitalizations. Activity trackers and smartwatches have long provided exactly such a tool for evaluating physical fitness. What if smartphones, voice assistants, and eventually Internet of Things devices and ambient computing systems could similarly serve as fitness trackers for the brain, without imposing any additional burden on the user? In this chapter, we explore two such early approaches—an in-depth analytical technique based on examining meta-features of virtual keyboard usage and corresponding typing kinematics, and another method which analyzes the acoustic features of recorded speech—to passively and unobtrusively understand mood and cognition in people with bipolar disorder. We review innovative studies that have used these methods to build mathematical models and machine learning frameworks that can provide deep insights into users’ mood and cognitive states. We then outline future research considerations and conclude with discussing the opportunities and challenges afforded by these modes of researching mood disorders and passive sensing approaches in general.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Vaccinations are critical and effective in resolving the current pandemic. With the highly transmissible and deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19), a delay in acceptance, or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccine services poses a significant public health threat. Moreover, vaccine-related hesitancy, mis/disinformation, and anti-vaccination discourse are hindering the rapid uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine. It is urgent to examine how anti-vaccine sentiment and behavior spread online to influence vaccine acceptance. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy diffusion networks in an online Reddit community within the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also sought to assess the anti-vaccine discourse evolution in language content and style. Overall, our study findings could help facilitate and promote efficient messaging strategies/campaigns to improve vaccination rates.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The growing demand for health assessment of civil infrastructure has allowed for a dense control, among others, of many bridges. The new industrial design of monitoring systems, based on cheaper hardware, at the same time granting satisfactory performances, is making available huge data flows, allowing researchers not just to create a wide database but also to create logbooks of possible anomalies and defects, which can be both related to the infrastructure and the monitoring system. When prompt alarms are to be sent to the bridge manager, to avoid failures, there is the risk to produce false positives, due to specific data features or ambiguous recorded structural behaviors that may appear as damage, therefore requiring a deeper knowledge level of the expected structural response, to be fully understood and classified as not dangerous in terms of risk for the human life (structural reliability). Only the combination of a continuous monitoring with the availability of an updated digital twin and a meticulous data interpretation of an expert engineer in the monitoring field can lead to a thorough understanding of the structural behavior and a proper asset management. In the present paper, an apparent damage identified by monitoring the dynamic response of a reinforced concrete bridge, under operational conditions, has proven to be a change of the static scheme of the structure, with a consequent bi-stable periodic variation of the structural behavior, explained, thanks to a fit-to-the-purpose numerical modeling.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The article deals with the problem of personal reaction to the danger of COVID-19 virus infection and its influence on social processes. Based on the results, the survey proposes the answers to the central questions of public health services development: what is the correlation between the trust of citizens in a national healthcare system, the government's decision, and the effectiveness of lockdown measures taken to stop the coronavirus spreading with reference of Ukraine and India. This research analyses focus on personal and social attitude towards the immediate danger and the ways how different cultural environments react to the new factors of development and risk in general. It proves that personal and social responsibility is directly connected with a level of trust in the national healthcare system and government decisions. Indian and Ukrainian societies before a face of equal danger and experiencing similar personal emotions show the different social behaviour due to the opposite attitude to national healthcare policy and different social and personal evaluations of the government response. The comparison of the answers of Indian and Ukrainian respondents showed a higher level of passive social reaction and obedience in the Indian group and the lower level of obedience and a higher level of active-controlled and uncontrolled reaction in the Ukrainian group. The research paper proposes some conclusions and recommendations about effective social management of personal and public healthcare challenges.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Asylum seekers face unique challenges associated with their specific status in the countries where they seek protection. These challenges include, but are not limited to, their ongoing involvement with legal systems of international protection, their tenuous immigration status and associated stresses, a lack of support in destination countries, and separation from family members. These experiences, the absence of guaranteed government protections due to selective and hostile asylum regimes in Western countries, and the exclusion of this population from welfare systems result in their precarious legal status. Asylum regulations in a receiving country can impact asylum seekers’ access to essential support and services. Furthermore, experiences of trauma and loss, and liminality caused by protracted application processes, affect the mental health and the well-being of asylum seekers. Because of asylum seekers’ unique challenges and experiences, practitioners require specialized knowledge and skills to support them effectively. This chapter will provide an overview of asylum processes and policies, using the US and European countries as examples. This chapter will also explore these governments’ current responses, common challenges and needs of asylum seekers living in these countries, and best practices and specialized skill social workers who need to support these populations in an integrative way.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This paper outlines the development of a real-time monitoring system, which incorporates hardware, software and database, applied to structural health monitoring (SHM). The system was conceived, designed, implemented and embedded on Raspberry Pi 3 (RP). With the need for reliability and information being provided in real time (IoT), RP has tightly integrated into the SHM field. To accomplish that, we developed an acquisition system based on Pmod IA (AD5933) along with the multiplex 4066, used to switch among the piezoelectric transducers. Furthermore, a real-time web application was developed to manage the acquisition system, integrate hardware with software and store the data collected in a dedicated NoSQL database. To perform excitation and get the structural response signals, experiments were carried out based on the electromechanical impedance technique by using three PZTs glued into an aluminium structure. Sinusoidal excitation signals, ranging from 20 kHz to 30 kHz with an amplitude of 2 V, were applied to the host structure. Overall, the reference system presented higher sensitivity for the RMSD metric, whilst the proposed system showed more relevance for damage detection via CCDM. Despite being implemented in low-cost hardware, the developed system identified structural failures with good reliability, being advantageous from both financial and dimension standpoints.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a field of increasing interest and worthy of new approaches and innovative applications. As well known, Italy boasts a unique cultural-historical heritage of monuments and archeological sites that need to be managed, particularly in a multi-hazard prone area like our country. A really appealing technique is represented by the advanced multi-temporal differential interferometry synthetic aperture radar (MT-DInSAR), which has been developed and applied in different fields in the last twenty years. The exploitation of such techniques in the monitoring and structural assessment of cultural heritage is still an open issue even if the first applications available in literature show promising potentialities. In this paper the general framework for structural monitoring and assessment previously proposed by the authors, is applied to the complex building San Michele in Rome (Italy). In particular, COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) ascending and descending datasets are collected and processed applying the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) method obtaining deformation time series and mean velocity maps of the persistent scatterers located in the investigated area, for both geometry acquisitions. Finally, different techniques useful for assessing the structural behavior and monitoring of constructions are applied and critically discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Guided wave-based techniques have been used extensively in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). Models using guided waves can provide information from both time and frequency domains to make themselves accurate and robust. Probabilistic SHM models, which have the ability to account for uncertainties, are developed when decision confidence intervals are of interest. However, most existing active-sensing guided-wave methods are based on the requirement that a relatively large data set can be collected, and thus are not feasible when data collection is restricted by time or environmental conditions. Meanwhile, simulation results, though lack of accuracy compared to real world data, are easier to obtain. In this context, models that incorporate data from different sources have the potential to embrace the accuracy of experimental data and the convenience of simulated data without the necessity of large and, potentially costly experimental, data sets. The goal of this work is to introduce and assess a probabilistic multi-fidelity Gaussian process regression framework for damage state estimation via the use of both experimental and simulated guided waves. The main differences from previous works include the combination of damage-sensitive features (damage indices; DIs) extracted from experimental and numerical sources, and a relatively small amount of real-world data. The proposed model is validated using data from two sources. The experimental data is collected from a piezoelectric sensor network attached to an aluminum plate under varying crack sizes while the simulated data comes from multi-physics finite element model (FEM) simulations with the same specifications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Although architectural interventions have the potential to help improve outcomes in prison rehabilitation, they cannot be analysed in isolation. Prison design is a social phenomenon, and as such, its actualisation is the result of the interaction of competing interests of different entities. Planners’ success in achieving the expected results of prison modernisationmodernization programsprogrammes seem to be sensitive to the organisational purposes, missions, and structures of prison services, making it harder to identify which phenomenon (or phenomena) influence the results. The same architectural characteristics of prisons, therefore, can have different outcomes depending on the geo-historical context of the prison system in different countries. Using a case study approach and critical realism this chapter investigates how and why the results of Chile's largest and most costly prison reform programprogramme did not meet stakeholders’ expectations. After reviewing the theoretical approach, the chapter explores the architectonical and historical features of the Chilean case, showing the priorities and concerns of both designers and prison authorities. Additionally, by drawing on Critical Realism and Organised Hypocrisy Theory, it will offer a plausible explanation of the causal mechanisms behind organisational patterns, how they work, and what can be done to unlock evolution.\",\n",

Although advanced technologies have become more prevalent in clinics, wards and operating theatres, drawing activities continue to be a significant means of recording observations, communication and planning as well as a methodology for teaching and learning. Interdisciplinary creative projects reveal the continued importance of drawing as a central, primal activity both as part of a purposeful dialogue and also as a useful tool to encourage active participation in teaching and learning.

       "  'abstract': 'Smartphones allow for several daily life enhancements and productivity improvements. Yet, over the last decade the concern regarding daily life adversities in relation to excessive smartphone use have been raised. This type of behavior has been regarded as “problematic smartphone use” (PSU) to describe the effects resembling a behavioral addiction. In addition to other problems in daily life, research has consistently shown that PSU is linked to various psychopathology constructs. The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of some findings in PSU research regarding associations with psychopathology. We also discuss some of the theoretical explanations that may be helpful in conceptualizing PSU. We then take a look at self-reported PSU in relation to objectively measured smartphone use, and, finally, provide some insight into current findings and future opportunities in objectively measuring smartphone use in association with psychopathology measures. This chapter may be useful as an introductory overview into the field of PSU research.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Every year, around 1.3 million people are killed on the road and another 20–50 million are severely injured. This makes road safety one of the most critical global public health issues. To address the negative trend, the international community has responded with the adoption of road safety targets. Sustainable Development Goals 3.6 and 11.2 are two examples. Also at the national level, goals and targets are increasingly used to steer work towards improved road safety. The frequent use of goals and targets in road safety policy makes it interesting to investigate under what conditions the adopted goals can be expected to be achieved. This chapter summarizes the main themes and conclusions of research that have been conducted on goal-setting in road safety policy and management to date. Drawing on previous research, it outlines and discusses a set of criteria that road safety goals should meet in order to be achievement-inducing, that is, have the capacity to guide and induce efforts towards the vision of zero fatalities and serious injuries on the road.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Aerospace, civil, energy, and mechanical engineering structures continue to be used despite reaching their design lifetime. Developing sensing and data analytics to assess the structural condition of the targeted systems is crucial. Traditional contact-based techniques may produce inconsistent results and are labor-intensive to be considered a valid alternative for monitoring large-scale structures such as bridges, large buildings, and wind turbines. Advancements in image-processing algorithms made techniques such as three-dimensional digital image correlation (3D-DIC), infrared thermography (IRT), motion magnification (MM), and structure from motion (SfM) appealing tools for structural health monitoring and non-destructive testing. Besides, as those techniques are implemented within unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the measurement process is expedited while reducing interference with the targeted structure. This paper summarizes the research experience performed at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. The results of these activities show that the combination of autonomous flight with 3D-DIC, IRT, and SfM can provide precious insights into the structural conditions of the inspected systems while reducing downtime and costs. The study includes future research directions to make those approaches suitable for real-world applications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A robust structural health monitoring approach measuring the structural responses of bridges such as displacements, strains etc. helps to ensure their safety and serviceability. Static and dynamic loads from vehicles and pedestrians influence the instantaneous responses of bridges, while thermal loads from daily and seasonal temperature variations influence bridge long-term responses. Vision-based monitoring (VBM) is an emerging non-contact, non-destructive monitoring approach. It utilizes cameras to capture sequential images of the structure under load and suitable image processing algorithms for target tracking. VBM has shown promising accuracy in static and dynamic response measurements of bridges, however, the evidence of its accuracy in thermal response measurements is limited. This research illustrates the results of laboratory experiments implementing VBM for thermal response measurements. Thermal responses of a laboratory truss are monitored with VBM and contact sensors such as thermocouples and linear variable differential transformers (LVDT). Cyclic temperature loads are applied to the truss to simulate daily temperature variations. The truss is monitored with GoPro cameras and contact sensors. Measured response trends by VBM and LVDT are comparable, indicating the accuracy of VBM to measure thermal responses. Thermal responses measured by VBM are higher than those of LVDT, signifying requirement for measurement resolution enhancement. The measurement resolution of VBM is 0.099\\xa0mm/°C and LVDT1 is 0.041\\xa0mm/°C respectively. This discrepancy can be attributed to non-identical targets of VBM and LVDT, resolution of the camera, efficiency of the feature tracking algorithm and robustness of LVDT output. This case study illustrates the feasibility and challenges of VBM for thermal response measurement.',\n",

The medical data collected using clinical codes from multiple sources are saved in structured form or free text. This data heterogeneity has extensively increased due to the exponential growth of healthcare data which makes data extraction complex, creates interoperability issues, and hinders healthcare development. Web Ontology Language (OWL) combined with Semantic Web technologies adds simplicity to searching, integrating, reusing, sharing information, and addressing interoperability issues. It is very much essential to transform medical data into ontologies to achieve improved semantic interoperability. This chapter focuses on a review of the significance of the semantic web in the medical industry and discusses different methods of building or transforming open EHR-based medical data to OWL individuals.

       "  'abstract': 'Structural health monitoring with wireless sensor networks (WSN) is an attractive alternative to traditional wired technology. The main challenges of WSNs are time synchronization, transmission of large amounts of data, and energy consumption. In this paper, autocovariance functions (ACFs) are estimated in all sensor nodes. Strict time synchronization is not necessary, because cross-correlations are not utilized. The measurement period must be long for a sufficient accuracy, but the number of samples in the transmitted ACFs is much smaller. The ACFs from all sensor nodes are transmitted to the base station for centralized data processing. Spatiotemporal correlation can be utilized, because for a stationary random process the ACFs have the same form as the free decay of the system. The covariance matrix is estimated using the training data from the undamaged structure under different environmental conditions. An extreme value statistics control chart is designed to detect damage. A numerical experiment was performed by simulating a bridge deck under stationary random excitation and variable environmental conditions. The excitation or environmental variables were not measured. Damage was a crack in a steel girder. Nonsimultaneous sampling of the WSN was simulated by selecting the starting time of the measurement randomly in each sensor node.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Smart City is defined as the use of technology and ICT based innovation to provide efficient services within a system. Smart Cities concept increases the efficiency of urban services, enhancing quality of life and generates new economic opportunities. But to wonder, the debate on the term “SMART CITIES” still continues. It is a dynamic term, having variation in its definition across places to places and from people to people. Basically, smart cities refer to the use of digital innovation to make urban service delivery more efficient. Our honorable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has always focused on the digitalization of our country. His dream of creating 100 smart cities and subsequent emphasis on creating self-sufficient smart villages can be only be achieved by integrating information and communication technologies (ICT) to provide interface between denizens and governance with improved infrastructure. This chapter is basically based on creating better neighbourhoods by combining technology interface with community participation for inclusive development. Smart Communities also play a major role in achieving the target of smart cities. Smart communities can be global as they exist all over the world as well as local since they are based on efforts on local level. Smart Community is described as a geographical area ranging in size from neighbourhood to a multi-country region whose citizens, governments, organizations use information technology to convert their area in efficient and beneficial ways. This needs cooperation among government, industry, citizen etc. This chapter also compares different approaches towards the smart communities. Also, this chapter presents various challenges that hinder the process of smart cities development.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The passage of time has brought mankind to a seamless communication universe with informational technologies and social network sites (SNS). This study examines the correlation between psychological distress and SNS among the general public. Five SNS needs were examined. Quantitative research design specifically a cross-sectional approach with a self-administered questionnaire was used to reach to the pool of respondents. Purposive sampling method was applied. A total of 210 responses were collected from Malaysians aged 18 and above. The findings reveal that overall psychological distress has led to the SNS needs with personal integrative needs (β\\u2009=\\u20090.332) emerged as the core needs followed by diversion need (β\\u2009=\\u20090.241), affective needs (β\\u2009=\\u20090.239), social interactive needs (β\\u2009=\\u20090.210) and cognitive needs (β\\u2009=\\u20090.197). While bulk of the studies examines the use of SNS leading to psychological distress, the current study empirically relates psychological distress as the antecedents of SNS usage. The findings offer insights to the respective authorities and mental associations for drawing up recouping strategies and programs to cope with mental health issues via SNS.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This chapter illustrates dietary strategies in the treatment of fecal incontinence. Although some foods must be excluded, the proportion of macronutrients should remain unchanged. One important strategy in dietary schemes to improve the symptoms of fecal incontinence is to drastically reduce several simple carbohydrates, in particular those known as FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols). The recommended percentage of calories from carbohydrates in patients with fecal incontinence should be around 55% and the percentage of energy from lipids around 30%. Moderate coffee consumption should be allowed, although each patient’s individual response should be monitored. Spices, as well as spicy and smoked foods, should be avoided or at least limited for their irritating action on the mucous membranes of the digestive system and stimulating effect on secretions and motility. The importance of the preferential use of healthy foods (fruit and vegetables, fish, extra virgin olive oil) is also discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Processing big data based on machine learning tools and deep learning models have become crucial in finding solutions to various problems in different fields. In particular, artificial intelligence systems play a key role in improving performance and increasing the speed of a clinical decision for a given clinical issue. In that respect, the outbreak of the virus caused by SARS-CoV-2 across the world has caused panic and unrest among people which required the rapid intervention of bioinformatics researchers and health professionals to discover the relevant clinical treatment. The main concern of the paper is to emphasize the usefulness of artificial intelligence and Big Data analytic for treating diseases. Thus, it discusses the past success of artificial intelligence and big data analytic for healthcare applications. It also presents the current advancements in machine learning tools as well as deep learning models for processing data sets related to the COVID-19 virus. In addition to that, the proposed work puts emphasis on the requirements of artificial intelligence models to make suitable clinical decisions.

       "  'abstract': 'This chapter analyses the approach to and advocacy around both sex work and trafficking in women for sexual exploitation of transnational sex worker organisations that operate at EU level, in particular, of TAMPEP and the ICRSE, in order to assess their desecuritising potential. Drawing on social movement theory and EU Gender Studies, I outline the specific obstacles that the collective mobilisation of sex workers confronts at EU level, including those posed by the EU’s own civil society interface. In turn, engaging critically with the unique approach to unmaking security proposed by Claudia Aradau, I argue, first, that while she is right in stating that the principles of universality and equality can be reclaimed from within liberal political institutions, and not just against them, she is wrong in identifying such principles in the notion of work , and thus sex work as having the potential to desecuritise trafficking in women for sexual exploitation at EU level. Secondly, I argue that Aradau adheres to what Chris Rossdale calls\\xa0a hegemonic ontology of agency , which makes her disavow the desecuritising potential of the advocacy that sex worker organisations engage in at a distance from the state. Drawing on post-anarchism theories, I conclude, that it is in the prefigurative forms of direct action and anarchistic\\xa0forms of subjective resistance that sex workers enact, in the public demonstrations they develop as whore-walks , in particular, that their true desecuritising potential lies.',\n",

Digital twin will detect the issues more accurately and predict the outcomes to improve the result and decision support system. Now near all the hospitals and clinical pharmacies expanding the use of digital twin for the well-being of patients and the effects of drugs on patients’ health. In healthcare, the digital twin acts as a lifelong rich data record of human health combined with Artificial intelligence and big data analysis models that will catechize the information to find treatment methods to various clinical questionnaires. Digital twin provides a deep understanding of a patient’s health like what is the patient’s medical condition and history? How is that responding to drugs? How does a patient reply to medical therapy? At the same time, it is very easy to provide the decision support system to doctor about the therapy which will help him to diagnose the disease. In this paper we are trying to elaborate the use of Digital Twin in medical sector industries based on IoT and Artificial Intelligence. Also, here we want to do the propaganda of Digital Twin enabling technologies and scope of open research for healthcare.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The article discusses the problem of determining safe work experience in conditions of increased intensity of hard work in Russia. It is especially relevant in construction industry. The need for an objective analysis of industrial accidents is an urgent task not only for the prevention of injuries, but also for improving environmental safety, interpreted as occupational risk management in order to protect the health of people of active working age. The research methodology was based on the analysis of the characteristics of the occupational diseases risk, depending on the level of existing harmful production factors, as well as the length of service. Occupational risk gradually increases nonlinearly over the course of the employee’s work experience, and in the experience sector the risk begins changing at an increasing rate. The new system for assessing working conditions introduced in 2014 cannot provide completely environmentally friendly and safe working conditions and acceptable risk ( R ). The environmental safety of production activities is a big question and is at high risk in the construction industry, in particular due to the huge number of concealment of occupational injuries, violations of the regenerative capacity of the human body, as well as the extension of the retirement age to 65 and 70\\xa0years. Therefore, it is required to introduce a mechanism (model), providing a real system for assessing working conditions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is a ubiquitous property of the nervous system that allows neurons to communicate and change their connections as a function of past experiences. Through reweighting of synaptic strengths, the nervous system can remodel itself, giving rise to durable memories that create the biological basis for mental function. In healthy individuals, synaptic plasticity undergoes characteristic developmental and aging trajectories. Dysfunctional plasticity, in turn, underlies a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, schizophrenia, addiction, and posttraumatic stress disorder. From a mechanistic standpoint, synaptic plasticity spans the gamut of spatial and temporal scales, from microseconds to the lifespan, from microns to the entire nervous system. With the numbers and strengths of synapses changing on such wide scales, there is an important need to develop measurement techniques with complimentary sensitivities and a growing number of approaches are now being harnessed for this purpose. Through hemodynamic measures, structural and tracer imaging, and noninvasive neuromodulation, it is possible to image structural and functional changes that underlie synaptic plasticity and associated behavioral learning. Here we review the mechanisms of neural plasticity and the historical and future trends in techniques that allow imaging of synaptic changes that accompany psychiatric disorders, highlighting emerging therapeutics and the challenges and opportunities accompanying this burgeoning area of study.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In aviation, carbon-fibre reinforced polymers and titanium alloys are widely used materials. Adhesive bonds are a lightweight option to transfer loads between different materials, and failure prediction of such adhesive joints is of great importance. This research is concerned with static damage detection of lap shear specimens with Structural Health Monitoring methods. The specimen design is derived from single-lap shear test specimens according to ASTM\\xa0D5868 , with one joining partner made of additively manufactured Ti6Al4V and the other one made of a carbon-fibre reinforced polymer laminate. The adhesive layer consists of the matrix material of the carbon-fibre reinforced polymer laminate. In order to enhance the lap shear, the additively manufactured part is printed in a comb-shape and on a number of specimens, pins are printed to yield additional interlocking of the parts. For assessment purposes, several different Structural Health Monitoring methods are available. Of these, Acoustic Emission measurements are evaluated in detail for this study. When the crack extends during linear increasing the load, acoustic waves propagate through the joining partners. To enable their detection, a piezoelectric element is bonded onto the surface of the Ti6Al4V adherend. The Acoustic Emission results show hits which are well separated from a noise floor, facilitating the use of Acoustic Emission for this application. Damages can be detected earlier than by evaluating strain changes with a Digital Image Correlation system.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Even though the world looks to have irreversibly changed since 2020, many social scientists are still looking at social life through a pre-Covid-19 lens. The evidence for this is present in the slow generation of empirical research during and in the aftermath, which could possibly generate new theoretical means to understand what this may mean for the generations to come. Major social change is underway. Almost every facet of social life is being rewritten right before our very eyes. The lockdowns, social distancing, and other measures implemented to ‘control’ the spread of Covid-19 have revolutionised the functioning of political and social institutions and have altered the platforms of social interactions and human relations. Yet the sublime ideological alignment of governments, the media, and law enforcement agencies in favour of these measures has radically polarised society as well as intensified present inequalities while simultaneously creating new ones in the process. All the while, all manner of historical , political , and social , as well as, importantly, medical context has been absent in the face of all this. Unless it moves quickly, criminology could well miss an opportunity to show its true multidisciplinary colours . This chapter seeks to give a general overview of this change in the context of social life, crime, and criminology.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Although there are countless examples of science informing policy over the nineteenth and twentieth century, theory relating to how this process happens has evolved significantly in recent years. Today there are three dominant schools of thought which consider how evidence\\xa0can be used to inform policy outcomes; political science, decision-making theory, and policy\\xa0studies. Political science emphasises the design of evidence, through classical models of social\\xa0enquiry, as fundamental to ensuring political impact (Green 2005). Decision-science or decision-making\\xa0theory emphasises the processes of deliberation and contestation through which\\xa0decisions are reached thereby highlighting potential entry points at which evidence can be presented (Goldie et al. 2006). Meanwhile policy studies emphasises the process of policy\\xa0formulation, with models ranging from decade-long cycles, to messy non-linear processes of coalitions weighing-up evidence inputs, beliefs, and political influences to design and advocate for interventions (Sabatier 1988; Cairney 2013). The most expansive literature on evidence to policy-uptake stems from the field of policy studies referred to as Evidence-Based or Evidence-Informed Policy (EBP / EIP), which has borrowed heavily from the evidence-based practice\\xa0movement which started in medical research.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Population-based structural health monitoring (PBSHM), expands the implementation of structural health monitoring concepts from a single structure to a group of structures. Within the populations of interest, it is useful to assess the similarity of structures, in order to form communities and networks; i.e., to establish clusters. By doing so, it is possible to infer whether transfer learning is likely to be applicable across a population. To address this, structures are represented in graphical form via irreducible element (IE) models or attributed graphs (AG), that encompass the topology, material properties and geometry of the structures. Kernel-based methods – also known as graph kernels – can then be applied to these IEs and AGs to assess the similarities within the population. In this paper, a number of comparisons are made between graphical representations of structures at different levels of resolution; these vary from assessing similarity at a purely topological level, to an increase in complexity, where discrete and continuous node labels are evaluated via graph kernels.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'An agent-based modelling approach is a powerful means of understanding social phenomena by modelling individual behaviours and interactions. However, the advancements in modelling pose challenges in the model analysis process for understanding the complex effects of input factors, especially when it comes to offering concrete policies for improving system outcomes. In this work, we propose a revised micro-dynamic analysis method that adopts advanced artificial intelligence methods to enhance the model interpretation and to facilitate group-specific policy-making. It strengthens the explanation power of the conventional micro-dynamic analysis by eliminating ambiguity in the result interpretation and enabling a causal interpretation of a target phenomenon across subgroups. We applied our method to understand an agent-based model that evaluates the effects of a long-term care scheme on access to care. Our findings showed that the method can suggest policies for improving the equity of access more efficiently than the conventional scenario analysis.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Urbanization process produces relevant negative impacts that need to be monitored. Within smart cities, extensive networks of standalone environmental sensors, potentially integrable within cloud computing capabilities, should serve as the basis of innovative near real-time monitoring systems, being able to characterize and to detect the variability of urban environmental parameters. While the interest is often concentrated on air quality and acoustic noise, other parameters might be of interest, including vibrations, since they can exert a relevant impact on human health and urban assents (buildings and infrastructures). This work focuses on the application of an innovative broadband monolithic mechanical seismometer, produced and commercialized by Advanced Scientific Sensors and Systems (Adv3S™), used as a stand-alone sensor to detect the features of the vibroscape (i.e.: the totality of vibrations of natural and anthropic origin). Results contain some examples of raw data, measured in the city of Napoli (Italy), proving the effectiveness of the sensor in detecting the urban vibroscape features. The sensor, having a low operational cost and high integrability into data networks, could be relevant in the context of smart cities, considering different applications, ranging from the structural health monitoring of urban assets to civil protection purposes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'There was more continuity than change in the way the Republic of Cyprus handled the Covid-19 crisis, reflecting the prevalence of entrenched apparatuses and established orthodoxies. The executive branch, already structurally concentrating in its hand’s substantial power via the Doctrine of Necessity, imposed because of the country’s ongoing ethnic conflict and division and the country’s presidential system, was strengthened further as it was effectively ruling by decrees without sufficient parliamentary scrutiny. Opposition parties kept a low profile and avoided to openly confront the government on the core issues, restricting criticism to peripheral matters and questioning the form of measures rather than the policy substance. At the same time, social dialogue was not suspended, and trade unions and employers were invited by the government to submit their views on aspects of the situation relevant to the economy and the labour market. Overall, no major change in policy direction has been evident so far and conservative rhetoric is widespread among government officials. To convey the government response and its surrounding social, economic and political environment, this chapter articulates how authoritarianism finds its specified, local expression and manifests itself into social disempowerment.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Human pathogenic viruses can be introduced into sewage sludge and soils via fecal material from a variety of human activities. These contaminated matrices can play a substantial role in the dispersion of pathogenic viruses in the environment, constituting a potential public health problem if they enter the water cycle or the food chain. However, the interactions between pathogenic viruses and these matrices have received less attention compared to other environmental compartments. Understanding the presence of viruses, their persistence and fate in solid or semi-solid matrices like sludge and soil is important for the effective control of the infections they may cause. In this chapter, we summarize current knowledge about human pathogenic viruses in sewage sludge and soil, their importance in public health, and the factors that govern their transport and persistence in soil matrices. We also review the occurrence and variety of common and emerging viruses excreted in the feces and their presence in sewage sludge and soil, as well as the potential use of certain viruses as indicators of fecal pollution.',\n",

While many of these endeavours\\xa0are impressive, creative, and have been shown to have positive impacts on people living and working within prisons, it is also possible to locate these ventures in a very long line of efforts to construct the perfect prison, a slippery goal that changes over time. This chapter reviews some of the more famous attempts (within the United States) at perfecting the prison, focusing on how reformers, designers, administrators, politicians, and others imagined perfection when speaking of incarceration. Equally important, this chapter also examines how and why these efforts failed.

       "  'abstract': 'Population-based Structural Health Monitoring (PBSHM), has emerged in the recent past as a means of creating diagnostic systems across populations (or fleets) of structures. This idea represents a powerful approach to solving the problem of data-scarcity in conventional SHM, where data are not available for all health states of interest. A critical element of PBSHM is a means of assessing the similarity of structures or sub-structures, so that knowledge is only transferred between structures if they are appropriately similar. One similarity measure has been developed on the basis of irreducible element models and graph theory. This idea was illustrated in the first part of this study, using highly-simplified “schematics” of structures – bridges and aeroplanes. The objective of the current paper is to show how the methodology applies to complex real structures, including a Hawk T.Mk1 jet aeroplane and suspension bridges.',\n",

As far as this sensor is concerned here the element (i.e., biological element) may be an enzyme or nucleic or simply an antibody. This is particularly useful in analyzing and finding chemical substance that may be integrating both bio-related equipment and on the other hand physicochemical detector. In regard to other than devices biosensors are more advanced, intelligent and with the features of sensitivity. This is a powerful element and mechanism dedicated in biological sensing in different aspects and areas such as environment and ecology, healthcare and medicine, drug discovery, food processing and safety, homeland security, agricultural sectors. In developing biosensor nanotechnology, electrochemistry is also playing a leading role due to cost-effective and increasing applications and role. Biosensors are analytical devices dependent, and it converts a biological response into a quantifiable signal. The core components of a biosensor are bioreceptor and transducer . Gradually different tools, techniques and technologies are integrated in biosensors for its productivity, development, etc. The rising applications of biosensor result effective results in healthcare sectors. Information technology applications in the field of biosensor are immense and increasing rapidly including artificial intelligence with ML and DL, big data and analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), etc. Better ICT applications in biosensors are directed in better analysis and result in diagnosing, monitoring and even in preventive health.

Designing these automated technologies requires the rigorous application of human factors principles as they would be used by clinicians and patients alike. In this chapter, we focus on an essential and widely used medical device in healthcare Healthcare : the smart infusion pump. Approximately 90% of hospital patients receive medications through the smart infusion pump. However, its increasing adoption in the US raises many human factors concerns for its end users especially because clinical settings are becoming increasingly complex and highly varied. We summarize common themes identified from the current research on human factors issues in smart infusion pump use. Key human–computer Human–computer interaction principles for smart infusion pump system design are also discussed. We present a case study involving the use of visual cues for facilitating smart infusion pump drug library update. We conclude that the application of human factors to medical device design has broader impacts on patients, clinicians, researchers, hospital managements, medical device manufacturers, human factors specialists, as well as regulatory bodies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Among the Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems, Guided Waves (GW) based ones have been increasingly investigated by both research community and industry since their reliability in damage detection, requirement of a lower power consumption and capability in the monitoring of extended areas with a reduced number of transducers. However, their use in real applications is still challenging. Among the critical aspects that can compromise the effectiveness of such SHM systems in the identification of structural anomalies, the operating conditions (temperature, loads, vibration, corrosion, etc.) require a particular attention. Damage detection algorithms and methods are thought mainly by referring to lower Technology Readiness Levels, typical of laboratory conditions where real scenarios cannot be easily reproduced. For this purpose, the Finite Element (FE) models find a key role for the understanding of the physics of governing phenomena driving the GW also in scenarios closer to the real one. In this paper, an experimentally validated FE model has been used to investigate on the effects of GW propagation mechanisms in a composite plate at 65\\xa0℃. The effects of this in-service temperature have been highlighted by comparing GW dispersive behavior as well as polar plots with respect to the room temperature (20\\xa0℃). According to the results, it has been observed a decrease of GW propagation velocity at 65\\xa0℃.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) field gained increasing interest during the last years, also due to the huge amount of civil structures and infrastructures near or beyond their design life, and needs to be managed, particularly in a multi-hazard prone area like Italy. In this context, the advanced multi-temporal differential interferometry synthetic aperture radar (MT-DInSAR) techniques represent a great potential for the SHM applications and future development. The exploitation of such techniques in the monitoring and structural assessment of the built environment is still an open issue even if some first applications are available in literature showing promising potentialities. In this work, after a brief description of the general framework for structural monitoring and assessment, previously proposed by the authors, the case study of the Torri Stellari buildings in Rome (Italy) is presented and critically discussed. In particular, starting from COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) ascending and descending SAR datasets and applying the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) DInSAR processing technique, the measurement points of the investigated area are obtained for both acquisition geometries. Different techniques are applied to both the displacement time series and mean deformation velocity for assessing the structural behavior or monitoring of constructions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The literature on blockchain technology in operations and supply chain management falls short in elaborating salient blockchain architectural features. Most often, it attempts to capture the difference between the public, private and consortium blockchain systems. To advance our knowledge of this distributed technology and help in a better understanding of its various applications, we focus on the consensus algorithms deployed within blockchain systems. We introduce the Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), Proof of Authority (PoA) and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT). Our paper demonstrates that many blockchain architectures and new supply chain configurations can emerge with the change in the blockchain consensus mechanism. We focus on the healthcare supply chain, one of the most appealing use cases for blockchain, to outline the architecture of state-of-the-art blockchain systems. This research is a step forwards illustrating the significant change in the concepts and practices towards fully decentralised supply chains.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'To address limitations presented by the unavailability of labelled data in structural health monitoring, transfer learning – in the form of domain adaptation – can facilitate leveraging information from a population of physical or numerical structures, by inferring a mapping that aligns the feature spaces. Thus, data from a similar source structure can be used to train a classifier that generalises to a target structure. Conventional unsupervised domain adaptation methods would assume that the data available from both structures belongs to the same number of damage-states or disparate environmental conditions; however, in practical scenarios, the data in the target structure may pertain to a subset of the available classes in the source structure; this is a partial domain adaptation problem. Conventional domain adaptation methods are prone to performance degradation in this scenario. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel statistic alignment method and instance-weighting strategy. A numerical population of structures demonstrates that these methods facilitate transfer where a number of state-of-the-art domain adaptation algorithms cannot.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Bolted joint is a critical component used in all engineering structures and industrial piping systems, including the petrochemical industry. Monitoring bolted joints structures are vital to ensure structural safety. In recent years, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors are becoming more appealing for sensing technology in structural health monitoring due to their promising features. In contrast to conventional electrical sensors, FBG sensors have a relatively high potential to withstand harsh conditions and are suitable for long-term applications due to their miniature size, ability to multiplex, immune toward electromagnetic interferences (EMI), higher resolution and fast response. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the experimental techniques applied for bolted joints health monitoring. Their relevant contributions for monitoring the degree of bolt looseness, bolt clamping force, bolt shear force and bolted flanges gap are also classified.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Brivio bridge, completed in 1917, consists of three reinforced concrete (RC) tied arches spanning 44.0\\xa0m each. The bridge crosses the Adda river on the route between Lecco and Bergamo and still represents a crucial node for the vehicular traffic of the region network. Hence, in the context of a research promoted by the Lombardy Region, the bridge has been equipped with a dynamic monitoring system, consisting of 8 seismometers per span. The response to operational excitations is collected at a sampling frequency of 100\\xa0Hz, with datasets of 3600\\xa0s being created every hour for automated processing. The paper describes the dynamic monitoring system installed in the bridge and selected results obtained during the first year of operation. Overall, seven vibration modes are identified for each span, with the temperature significantly affecting the natural frequencies, whereas no remarkable changes of mode shapes are detected so far. The possible onset of structural changes is identified by using both the changes in mode shapes and the cleansed natural frequencies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'To move towards a condition-based maintenance practice for aircraft structures, design of reliable health management methodologies is required. Development of diagnostic methodologies is commonly realised on simplified sample structures with assumptions that methodologies can be adapted for application to realistic aircraft structures under in-service conditions. Yet such actual applications are not conducted. In this work, we study the development of diagnostic methodologies to training structures and their application to dissimilar testing structures. A heterogeneous population is considered, consisting of single-stiffener composite panels for methodology development and training and a multi-stiffener composite panel for application and testing. Characteristics as its composite material, lay-up, and temperature condition are constant while topologies and applied loads differ between the dissimilar structures. Damage in the structural panels is monitored on multiple diagnostic levels using a variety of structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques, including acoustic emission and distributed strain sensing. Specifically, we develop diagnostic methods for localising and monitoring disbond growth after impact using strain data collected during fatigue testing of multiple single-stiffener panels and apply these for disbond monitoring in an upscaled version of a multi-stiffener panel. In this manner, this study aids in the maturement and application of SHM methodologies to realistic aircraft structures.',\n",

They possess astounding diversity as well as numbers, indicating the evolution of immense adaptation as well as their astounding success. Because of being so well adapted and resilient, insect biochemistry and physiology has coevolved to resist the most stressful of abiotic and biotic factors. This has led to an array of defensive chemicals tailormade to target encountered biological dangers such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, predators, etc. Insects as potential cures has been recognized since times of yore, but unfortunately this native knowledge has not yet been translated into pharmaceutical successes to the extent desired.

       "  'abstract': 'The difference between damage-affected signals and temperature-affected signals is investigated. Temperature effects were examined by measurements in a climatic chamber. Sensors were mounted on the skin of a CFRP sandwich structure which was exposed to temperatures from −50 to\\u2009+50\\xa0°C with the step of 10\\xa0℃. Both A0 and S0 modes were analyzed in the frequency range of 50–300\\xa0kHz. Time of flight delays indicating a velocity decrease with increasing temperature were confirmed for the corresponding modes. However, with decreasing temperature, frequency shifts towards higher frequencies were observed, which caused difficulties for dispersion curve determination. Damage–type signals were demonstrated by impact-induced damage. Time of flight change was examined in relation to the temperature and damage. Temperature affected time delay/time advance increased with the signal length while damage influenced only some part of the signal. These findings enabled to distinguish the cause of the time of arrival change. Therefore, false alarms regarding damage detection are likely to be reduced.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This research investigates if consumers were less price sensitive to life necessities during the COVID-19 pandemic via a demand modeling system. Consumers’ price sensitivity was explicitly quantified by the price elasticity of demand. Consumer behavior in nine categories of products considered as life necessities were studied in two non-overlapping time periods: a year before the onset of the COVID pandemic and a year following the initial panic buying caused by the declaration of the COVID pandemic. The changes in price elasticity of demand between the two periods across the nine product categories were determined from the weekly sales data of a Dutch retailer. Using the proposed demand modeling system applied to available data, it was empirically found that the majority of essential food products were price inelastic, while the majority of non-food products were price elastic during the COVID period. Among the nine product categories, four categories were identified to have significantly different elasticities across the two time periods, while eight categories were observed to have practically smaller magnitudes in elasticities. These insights not only prove the usefulness of the proposed demand modeling system, but also provide valuable theoretical and managerial implications for retail business practitioners, particularly in pricing and inventory planning.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The digital construction transformation requires utilising emerging digital technology such as deep learning to automate implementing tasks. Therefore, this article evaluates the current state of utilising deep learning in the construction management tasks to enable researchers to determine the capabilities of current solutions and find research gaps to carry out more research to bridge revealed knowledge and practice gaps. First, the scientometric analysis is conducted for 181 articles to assess the density of publications on different topics of deep learning-based construction management applications. After that, a thematic and gap analysis is conducted to analyse the contributions and limitations of key published articles in each area of application. The scientometric analysis indicates four main applications of deep learning in construction management: automating progress monitoring, automating safety warning for workers, managing construction equipment, and integrating IoT with deep learning to collect data from the site automatically. The thematic and gap analysis refers to many successful cases of deep learning in automating site management tasks. However, more validations are recommended to test developed solutions, as well as additional research is required to consider practitioners’ and workers’ perspectives to implement mentioned applications in their daily tasks. This article enables researchers to directly find the research gaps in the developed solutions and develop more workable applications to bridge revealed gaps. Accordingly, this will be reflected in speeding the digital construction transformation, a strategy worldwide. This article is the first to adopt a structured technique to assess deep learning-based construction site management applications to enable researchers/practitioners to either adopt these applications in their projects or conduct further research to extend developed solutions and bridge revealed knowledge gaps.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Nowadays, and after successive changes at all levels, namely, in what is the concept of family, its standards and the demands placed on it, it has become difficult to balance professional and family roles. The incompatibility of these roles and the difficulties felt when trying to balance these spheres can lead to work-family and family-work conflict and consequently to feelings of guilt. These consequences can negatively affect individuals regarding their well-being and career satisfaction. Through a sample of 180 participants, 107 women and 73 men, aged between 21 and 71\\xa0years (M\\u2009=\\u200938.57; SD\\u2009=\\u20099.83), this quantitative study aims to analyze the influence of work-family conflict and guilt on well-being and career satisfaction. The results show that conflict is a predictor of guilt and both influence well-being but have no influence on career satisfaction. This reinforces the importance of developing family-friendly practices and policies by organizations, aimed at increasing the well-being and satisfaction of their human capital.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the context of recent reusable launch vehicles (RLV) developments, the SHM methods could be useful to help fast and economic revalidation of RLVs between launches, provided that the SHM transducers keep their functionality under extreme environmental conditions during flight. This paper focuses on the thermal cycling durability of PZT piezoelectric transducers bonded on a Carbon Fiber Reinforce Polymer (CFRP) composite plate. The temperature cycles are set to be representative of the thermal loadings that the structure of a launcher could experience under a thermal barrier: limited number of cycles (<10) of short duration (<10\\xa0min) and high temperatures for thermoset-matrix composites (150 $$^\\\\circ $$ ∘ C). The heating is generated using a CO2 laser in order to obtain the steep thermal ramps (60 $$^\\\\circ $$ ∘ C/min) and gradients through the plate thickness to best reproduce flight conditions. To our knowledge, very few research studies have been carried out so far on the resistance of SHM systems under such environment. The degradation of the system formed by the composite plate, the adhesive and the PZT transducer is studied, in comparison with the state of reference before cycling, with three different approaches. First, electromechanical impedance is measured during the entire thermal cycling. Then the functionality of a guided wave SHM system is evaluated based on the emission and reception of Lamb waves between PZTs attached to the surface of the plate. Finally, Laser vibrometry is used to provide a mapping of the emitted Lamb waves propagation and to identify possible debondings or changes of amplitudes of waveforms after the thermal cycles.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious virus which has caused the Coronavirus disease – 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in 2019, and, in a very short time, it has infected people all over the world. In fact, WHO declared it as pandemic in March 2020. The adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be originated from interaction between several hosts, which makes it a potential zoonotic agent. Regarding the survival of virus on the environment, it is important to assess the period of infectivity, which differs among different surfaces. This chapter highlights the viability of virus on different contaminated surfaces, also focusing on metagenomic interactions. To investigate the potential directions for the evolution of this pandemic in the future, SARS-CoV-2 requires a reliable tool to access crucial details regarding the adaptation and evolution of the virus in the environment. Bioinformatic tools play an important role in identifying the similarity and variations in the Open Reading Frames (ORFs) of the viral genomes to elucidate the phytogenic relationships. In this regard, this chapter discusses about recent advances in bioinformatic tools to track the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the soil and aquatic ecosystem. New technologies are coming into existence with a new aspect of solving some social problems. Hence, in this work a reliable in silico tool for metagenomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the environment has been discussed. Overall, this study tries to shed further light on aspect that could help to understand different types of robotics and techniques used for soil and aquatic system, with the main aim of accessing to relevant details on SARS-CoV-2 in the environment.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'SAR Satellite monitoring is an interesting alternative to traditional Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) techniques since it does not require the installation of sensors and enables the collection of data on a large spatial scale. The data collected by satellites are processed to obtain time histories of displacements through which phenomena such as settlements at the base of a structure can be identified and followed over time. This article provides a general overview of SAR satellite monitoring of structures and infrastructures, with a specific focus on DInSAR techniques (“Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar”). A data processing technique is presented to analyze DInSAR displacements to gain insight into the structural behavior. The case study investigated in this paper is the Palatino bridge in Rome, Italy. The SAR satellite data are acquired by COSMO-SkyMed of the Italian Space Agency and consist of displacements calculated during an acquisition period between 2010 and 2019. SAR satellite data allows to study the structural behavior in the vertical and longitudinal (i.e., along the bridge axis) directions. The effect of temperature on the bridge behavior is investigated.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of ageing infrastructures represents one of the most important and challenging issues in modern society. In this framework, the increasing number of bridge collapses has progressively fueled the interest towards the development of reliable monitoring strategies, able to efficiently ensure real-time bridge assessment and early-stage damage detection. To this aim, recent advancements in sensor technologies and data science have strongly encouraged the use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Within the unsupervised learning context, this paper proposes an innovative convolutional autoencoder-based damage detection technique applied to the Z24 benchmark bridge. Firstly, raw acceleration sequences of user-defined length are converted into images using the Gramian Angular Field Approach (GAF). Then, during the training, the model learns how to correctly reconstruct healthy data acquired by SHM systems. The trained network is afterwards tested with unknown data and the mean absolute error (MAE), considered as a damage-sensitive feature, is adopted to quantify the errors between the original input and reconstructed output. Finally, damage detection is performed when the percentage of damaged sequences within a pre-defined macro-sequence exceeds a properly fixed threshold. Results prove that the implemented ML algorithm, working at the level of single sensor, is effective to enable continuous assessment of large-scale monitored bridges as new data is collected, involving limited computational efforts.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common pregnancy complication associated with risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) for mother and offspring. Although glucose intolerance is a hallmark of GDM, there is evidence of GDM subtypes. Here we outline the application of metabolomics to understanding risk, treatment, and prognosis of GDM, and where possible the utility of metabolomics in understanding subtypes of GDM. Studies of metabolomics using blood collected during pregnancy indicate that GDM risk and treatment is associated with altered levels of amino acids, long-chain fatty acids, and glycolytic intermediates. Further, use of multiple metabolites in conjunction with clinical factors has a better value over clinical factors alone or a single metabolite, for predicting risk of T2D among women who had GDM. Although these data provide novel insights, the application of metabolomics in guiding GDM treatment, monitoring of adherence, and evaluation of prognosis has yet to be fully realized.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The fields of positive psychology (PP) and the psychology of religion/spirituality (PRS) have much in common, both in terms of their areas of interest and the presuppositions they bring to their work. For example, PP and PRS are both rooted in the philosophies of positivism (which assumes all knowledge must be empirically verified using the scientific method) and naturalism (which assumes there are no realities beyond the natural, material world). Both PP and PRS have much to offer society and the scientific community, but their historic roots in positivistic naturalism currently limit this potential, both in terms of concepts and methods. In this chapter, we argue that for PP and the PRS to coevolve and flourish, they must transcend their perhaps often unaware—but staunch—commitment to positivistic naturalism. In particular, the fields of PP and PRS need to draw inclusively and meaningfully from the methodological, conceptual, and experiential insights of philosophical and religious traditions. Doing so will help PP and PRS broaden the scope of what they each consider meaningful, possible, desirable, and transformative. Ironically, a greater appreciation of the past will enable both fields to have greater scientific, societal, and practical impact in the future.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In developing countries, healthcare monitoring is a crucial component for determining the well-being of the patient, and at the same time, it is highly effective for managing the hospital resources which are limited in developing countries like India. With the increase in amount of digital data available for healthcare sector and the development of tools for data analysis, a new era of medical treatment could be arrived at with stringent methods of checking the efficacy of medicines and devising statistically valid tests that would authoritatively show the scope of medical treatment. This paper proposes a conceptual healthcare data model based on data mining techniques. The predictions have been made based on NHRM and RCH dataset, and three data mining tools, i.e., IBM SPSS Modeler, RapidMiner, and Weka, are used for determining the performance of the proposed model. Different classifiers, namely CHAID, random forest, K-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, decision tree, Naïve Bayes, and C5.0, are used for predicting the stay of pregnant ladies in the hospital. A detailed analysis of these classifiers on the data mining toolset is also presented in this paper.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Reliability assessment of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems poses new challenges pushing the research community to address many questions which are still open. For guided wave-based SHM it is not possible to evaluate the system performance without taking into account the target structure and applied system parameters. This range of variables would result in countless measurements. Factors like environmental conditions, structural dependencies and wave characteristics demand novel solutions for performance analysis of SHM systems compared to those relying on classical non-destructive evaluation. Such novel approaches typically require model-assisted investigations which may not only help to explain and understand performance assessment results but also enable complete studies without costly experiments. Within this contribution, a multi input multi output approach using a sparse transducer array permanently installed on a composite structure to excite and sense guided waves is considered. Firstly, the method and the analysis of path-based performance assessment are presented considering an open-access dataset from the Open Guided Wave platform. Then, a performance analysis of a guided wave-based SHM system using Probability of Detection is presented. To explain some unexpected results, the model-assisted investigations are used to understand the physical phenomena of wave propagation in the test specimen including the interaction with damage. Finally, issues and future steps in SHM systems’ performance assessment and their development are discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has been a significant research topic to help with damage detection in civil structures and to stop further deterioration. Traditional methods of SHM are time consuming and cost ineffective. In addition, civil structures such as dams and high raised buildings are burdensome and risky to inspect manually, especially after a natural disaster. Crack signals the beginning of failure for any structure. Most of the existing methods largely deal with only the detection of cracks. Proposed work concentrates on segmentation, classification, and subsequent detection of cracks based on pattern i.e., Linear vs branching, apart from the single and multiple cracks. The image dataset was obtained from real-time visual inspections. This study is significant because a branching crack shows greater structural stress than a linear crack. Furthermore, results quantify the damage in the image using instance segmentation techniques. Experimental analysis achieves classification and quantification of the data with good accuracy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Disasters have different effects on different people. Natural and man-made calamities have ravaged Sri Lanka on several occasions, disproportionately affecting the socially excluded and marginalized people. When it comes to the treatment of marginalized people in disasters, the primary rule is that everyone, regardless of their differences, should have the same privileges and rights. However, there has been fewer study of the literature on the extent of social exclusion experienced by Sri Lanka’s excluded population during disasters. Building disaster-resilient communities has become a top priority for crisis management organizations around the world in recent years, as resilient communities are more likely to incur less losses and recover more swiftly in the case of a disaster. To improve a society’s resilience, however, one must first create a baseline, or a starting point from which to compare communities. This research uses a Systematic Literature Review to synthesize the context of marginalization during disasters in Sri Lanka, drawing on examples and models from other countries. Data was acquired utilizing two databases, as well as scanning the gray literature. The PRISMA model was used for the screening process of the literature. Studies conducted on marginalization in disasters, published in English, were selected by the reviewer. Furthermore, the VOS viewer data mining tool was used for developing a network map of keywords of the selected literatures to identify the most investigated areas. Out of 2072 of total articles published between 2016 and 2021, 37 articles have been included and reviewed in this study. In order to define a socially excluded marginalized community during disasters, six significant parameters of marginalization were eventually identified. The problem describes how marginalization accelerates as a result of various overlapping vulnerabilities, and how these marginalized groups are underrepresented in the disaster cycle and decision-making processes as a result of disaster planning, impact, response, and recovery.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Modelling the times-to-failures in industrial assets is critical for their maintenance planning. Modern fleets often comprise of clusters of similarly deteriorating assets, due to customisation or diversity in their operational settings. As such, the prevalent techniques of using a single fleet-wide model or independent cluster-specific models for modelling the times-to-failures are associated with high bias or high variance respectively. The problem of high variance is especially prominent for the asset clusters with where relatively fewer failures are observed. This paper proposes that statistical hierarchical modelling systematically mitigates the problem of high variance for the clusters with sparse data using shared higher level models for the cluster-specific model parameters. A hierarchical model of the Weibull density functions is shown in this chapter as an example because of the popularity of the Weibull distributions in reliability applications. Failure trajectories from a fleet of simulated turbofans are used herewith for the experiments that compare the advantage of the proposed hierarchical model over independent or fleet-wide models for modelling the observed times-to-failures.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Health monitoring of structures has a great contribution to the growing interest of researchers in damage detection. The Structural Engineering Community is nowadays employing Electro-Mechanical Impedance (EMI) technique on a wide range for monitoring the health of structures. EMI technique involves the use of Piezoelectric (PZT) patches bonded to the host structure and also instruments such as Impedance analyzer/LCR meter, Wired/Wireless connections, etc. The change in conductance/impedance/susceptance signatures in comparison with the healthy signatures defines the presence of damage. The experimental arrangement in this regard resembles the impedimental system approach. So, substitutable modeling and analysis with the help of simulation are preferable. In this research, a beam-column joint has been modeled in ANSYS 19.2 software. After analysis, the joint has been monitored for baseline (healthy) results on the basis of the simulated EMI technique for health inspection. After getting the baseline conductance and susceptance signatures, the beam-column joint has been formed with a crack modeled on the joint. The fracture analyzed model was then monitored in the same way as a healthy model with the help of the PZT patch. The conductance signature so obtained was then compared with the baseline (healthy) signature, the change in which identified the presence of a crack on the joint. Root mean squared deviation (RMSD) values have been calculated for computing the change in conductance values for respective frequency ranges.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Vision Zero is a term mainly connected to road traffic safety and has its roots in the Swedish road safety policy, although similar concepts are used in other countries. It was adopted by the Swedish Parliament in 1997, and due to the success of lowering the number of deaths in traffic crashes significantly, it has become an inspiration to road safety strategies in countries and cities all over the world. An important factor as to why Vision Zero diffuses is the incorporation of the vision in reports and strategies from international intergovernmental organizations and through the work of nongovernmental organizations. The development of finding a common global strategy for road safety has been an ongoing process for many years, and the purpose of this chapter is to map the role of Vision Zero in this global development process. This is performed by studying the integration of Vision Zero in the road safety work and strategies of key international intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations. The chapter also contains an account of possible opportunities and advantages of working with Vision Zero as a tool on the global level as well as the criticism towards the approach. This chapter discusses the content of what is being diffused, why it is diffused, who is diffusing, and how it is diffusing. The material consists of key global policy documents and 29 semi-structured interviews with senior experts working with road safety on a global level. The main conclusions are that Vision Zero is a well-established global road safety policy program and a road safety philosophy integrated into both the work and texts of the major intergovernmental organizations working with road safety. There is a widespread opinion that Vision Zero and other safe system approaches constitute a paradigm shift in global road safety work. It is regarded as an innovative and inspiring policy based primarily on its ethical approach. It is also regarded as a coherent policy program and rests firmly upon years of progress and experience. Even though many of the respondents are positive towards the ethical base and the systematic approach, there are still those who argue that Vision Zero cannot be used as a policy tool, at least not in low- and middle-income countries. It is obvious that Vision Zero is not interpreted and reproduced in the same way in all contexts, but the question is if that is part of a natural transformation process leading to new interpretations or if it is a problem for the Vision Zero trademark.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Bioactive compounds isolated from plant sources are the secondary metabolites that have toxicological or pharmacological properties depending upon their structure. Recently, these compounds have received more attention due to their diverse role in providing protection against various types of pathogenic and non-pathogenic diseases. These miraculous bioactive compounds also pursue pharmacological activities against several microbial pathogens and are also known to exhibit antidiabetic, antipyretic, anticancerous, antidiuretic, and antioxidant properties. Some bioactive compounds extracted from plants such as phenolic compounds, anthocyanidins, flavonoids, tannins, and flavones are found in significantly high concentration in the biosphere, and certain others are present in less amount but their pharmacological as well as commercial importance cannot be denied. The activities of bioactive compounds like flavonoids, polyphenols, not only functions to inhibit microbial growth but also they act synergistically with other drugs which make them ideal for alternative cancer remedies. This chapter provides a general insight into secondary metabolites having antimicrobial and anticancerous properties, their plant source, and their mode of actions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Culturally responsive cross-pollination of positive psychology (PP) and the psychology of religion/spirituality (PRS) has the potential to enrich both subfields and augment their impact. To strengthen the interaction of PP and the PRS beyond the traditional boundaries of the West, this chapter explores the current overlap between these two psychology subfields in Africa, Asia, and Oceania. After providing a brief overview of each region, we apply a systematic approach to identify and evaluate research that intersects PP and the PRS in each region. Our search revealed a total of 128 scholarly articles over the last three decades. Topical emphases were classified into three overarching themes: (a) well-being, (b) character strengths and virtues, and (c) positive adaptation. Although recent growth in publication outputs within each region is an encouraging sign for the next wave of research, the quality of the existing empirical evidence is limited by an overreliance on cross-sectional observational studies. We highlight some of the ways that culturally responsive cross-pollination of PP and the PRS could benefit people living in Africa, Asia, and Oceania. We also offer suggestions for broadening the scope and enhancing research that intersects both subfields in these culturally and religiously diverse regions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Content moderation is a laborious position that requires employees to review highly graphic content for a notable portion of their workday. Adverse mental health effects have been associated with this classification of profession to include compassion fatigue, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress (STS), emphasizing a need for preventative measures to moderate these hazards. The present study aimed to identify whether a trauma focused resilience training program, termed The TaskUs Method, could sustain or improve a reviewer's resilience and compassion scores while minimizing the risk of developing secondary traumatic stress (STS) or burnout following repeated exposure. Similar to previous research on adjustment and desensitization, the study found a slight decline in resilience and compassion satisfaction within the first three months of employment. However, unlike previous research, the scores for resilience and compassion remain stable for three months following first exposure within production. Burnout and STS scores remained stable from baseline through three months, indicating that resilience acts as a moderating variable for the effects of content exposure. Additionally, cognitive control was found to predict burnout and STS, meaning individuals with higher cognitive control were less likely to feel overwhelmed and manage stress more effectively. Finally, resilience exhibited the most pertinent influence, as higher resilience scores were found to predict lower scores of burnout and STS and positively predicted compassion satisfaction.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Structural Health Monitoring deals mainly with sensorised structures providing signals related to their “health status” aiming at lower maintenance costs and weights of aircrafts. Much effort has been spent during last years on analysis techniques for evaluating metrics correlated to damages’ existence, location and extensions from signals provided by the sensors networks. Deep learning techniques can be a very powerful instrument for signals patterns reconstruction and selection but require the availability of consistent amount of both healthy and damaged structural configuration experimental data sets, with high materials and testing costs, or data reproduced by validated numerical simulations. Within this work explicit finite element simulation of impact damages on composite plates have been used to populate the data sets necessary for deep learning algorithm. The final scope is the detection of delaminations into composites plates for aerospace employ. Numerical time history signals have been collected for both the healthy and unhealthy state of the structure and transformed into RGB images. A convolutional algorithm trained on healthy and damaged signals has been used to identify anomalies in the form of delamination in the structure. This paper will present the preliminary results achieved by the authors.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In 1997, the Riksdag, the Swedish Parliament, adopted Vision Zero as a new goal and strategy for road safety in Sweden (Swedish Government 1997). In the more than 20\\xa0years since the Vision Zero policy was adopted, it has spread internationally as a model of a public road safety policy (OECD/ITF 2008, 2016; World Health Organization 2017). It is not only in the transport sector that Vision Zero has attracted interest; it has also spread and continues to spread to other sectors of Swedish society such as fire safety, patient safety, occupational accidents, and suicide (Kristianssen et al. 2018). Although, road safety policies and strategies can be developed and adopted by a variety of actors at different levels in the society in a democracy, parliaments have a special position, and it establishes an exclusive legitimacy in the society. According to the Swedish Constitution (Swedish Parliament 2016), all public power proceeds from the people, and the Riksdag (the Swedish Parliament) is the foremost representative of the people. Therefore, this chapter focuses on the Swedish Parliament and the Swedish Government and how road safety, as a public policy, finds its way into public agenda in a competing political environment. The decision to adopt Vision Zero in Sweden was a rather radical change (Belin et al. 2011) of that time safety policy. This chapter examines the political decision-making process that preceded the decision by the Swedish Parliament to adopt the Vision Zero policy in 1997 (Swedish Parliament 1997) and the decision to re-evaluate Vision Zero in 2004 (Swedish Parliament 2004).',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background Persistent racial disparities in lung cancer incidence, treatment, and survival are well documented. Given the importance of surgical resection for lung cancer treatment, racial disparities in surgical quality were investigated using a statewide quality collaborative. Methods This retrospective study used data from the Michigan Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons General Thoracic database, which includes data gathered for the Society of Thoracic Surgeons General Thoracic Surgery Database at 17 institutions in Michigan. Adult patients undergoing resection for lung cancer between 2015 and 2021 were included. Propensity score-weighting methodology was used to assess differences in\\xa0surgical quality, including extent of resection, adequate lymph node evaluation, 30-day mortality, and 30-day readmission rate between white and black patients. Results The cohort included 5073 patients comprising 357 (7%) black and 4716 (93%) white patients. The black patients had significantly higher unadjusted rates of wedge resection than the white patients, but after propensity score-weighting for clinical factors, wedge resection did not differ from lobectomy (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78–1.49; P = 0.67). The black patients had fewer lymph nodes collected (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.77; 95% CI, 0.73–0.81; P < 0.0001) and lymph node stations sampled (IRR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84–0.94; P < 0.0001). The black patients did not differ from the white patients in terms of mortality (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.19–2.34; P = 0.55) or readmission (OR, 0.79; 95 % CI, 0.49–1.27; P = 0.32). The black patients had longer hospital stays (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02–1.14; P = 0.01). Conclusion In a statewide quality collaborative that included high-volume centers, black patients received a less extensive lymph node evaluation, with fewer non-anatomic wedge resections performed, and a more limited lymph node evaluation with lobectomy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) constitute exogenous agents which enter the body via food intake, inhalation, or direct contact. In addition to the lifelong exposure to environmental EDCs, a transplacental transfer seems to be also an important route. EDCs affect various aspects of the endocrine system leading to endocrine dysfunction. In addition, EDCs are involved in the pathogenesis of cancer in general, and endocrine cancer (EC) in particular. The association of EDCs with EC is mediated through their effects on immune balance, inflammation, and oxidative stress, all of them basic components in carcinogenesis. Besides, some EDCs present with a hormone-like activity acting on nuclear (genomic) and transmembrane receptors (nongenomic) leading to EC. The exact role of EDCs on EC development and/or its evolution is very complicated and has not been fully clarified, due to the complex and multifactorial pathogenesis of cancer and its lifelong manifestation. Although a quite large body of evidence support the role of EDCs in the pathogenesis of various endocrine disorders and some types of EC, there is limited evidence on their role in gonadal and adrenal cancer.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Pollution is a major public health and human rights issue that disproportionately affects the poor and disadvantaged. However, academic studies have not fully explored the relationship between poverty and the spatial distribution of environmental pollution, notably in Thailand. Thus, this chapter aims to fill a void in academic research by exploring the implementation of machine learning in the estimation of poverty by training input data from widely available and accessible open source, including environmental pollution and road density. The poverty rate is obtained from the TPMAP website and then clustered into two groups, “high and low,” using hot spot analysis. The Google Earth Engine is used to extract pollution indexes such as carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, nitrogen, and sulfur dioxide, while road density is downloaded from OpenStreetMap. This study compares four different machine learning models: XGboost, lasso, random forest, and ridge regression for poverty estimation. The result of the study reveals that poverty-related areas are highly correlated with environmental pollution. The random forest technique has the best performance prediction among the four methods, with an R 2 of 0.79. Finally, feature importance analysis is used to determine the most influential features in order to assist decision-makers in gaining a better understanding of poverty.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Monitoring large structures over their lifetime is becoming increasingly important as robust monitoring will ensure safety and financial benefits. Offshore wind turbines (OWT) are in need of continuous structural health monitoring (SHM) methodologies for scour detection. Reliable detection of scour requires robust selection of structural features to adequately represent the integrity of the OWT. Successful identification of operational modal parameters of OWT is challenging because of the effect of environmental and operational variability (EOV). Therefore, mitigating the effect of EOV is crucial to guarantee that the variability in the extracted features is caused by structural degradation. This work presents a methodology based on stochastic subspace identification enhanced by a clustering technique to identify stable and robust structural modes over time. Gaussian process regression is used to mitigate EOV due to its flexibility and non-parametric nature. Data collected from a control OWT and a scoured OWT in operation over 8-months is used for verification. The results have demonstrated that scour affects OWTs by reducing their natural frequencies. The results also indicate that scour induces OWTs to react differently to EOV. The outcomes of this work provide the basis for real time monitoring of OWTs, thus facilitating a reliable identification of scour.',\n",

They often use their cell phones and the internet for shopping, information collection, communication, and education purposes. Also, they require ‘smart services’ in their home, cities, and shopping. They are optimistic about using ‘smart packaging,’ as they need more information about packaged products.

       "  'abstract': 'Structural health and condition assessment have become an important part of infrastructural life, due to continuous deterioration caused by nature or human activities. It ensures public safety and saves the economy if carried out properly. Even though deterioration is the natural process of a structure, the rate depends on the functional utility and its maintenance. So, poor maintenance of commercial structures, public buildings, and historical constructions can lead to major damages to sudden collapse. There are several methodologies to predict the health of the structures like destructive, Non-destructive, and sensor-based evaluations, but there is a huge scarce of experienced engineers in interpreting and evaluating the condition of the structures. In this paper, an attempt is made to help engineers in a robust way with fast-moving models to predict the condition at a global level of the structure using Machine Learning for the data obtained from Non-Destructive Tests (NDT) which are in general carried on local level structural elements. In conclusion, a model is proposed which connects between local elemental properties to global behaviour.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"This contribution describes some activities promoted by a group of roboticists from Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia and Università di Pisa in response to the pandemic. In particular, a “do-it-yourself” (DIY) open-source service and related hardware/products will be illustrated to help combat some consequences of the Covid 19 emergency. The project was born to facilitate communication between patients isolated in Covid 19 hospitals’ ward and their relatives. The teleoperated robot named LHF Connect can move autonomously around the hospital. Once it arrives at each patient's bed, it can provide a video call between patients and their relatives or friends outside the isolated hospital ward. In this scenario, the robot is piloted by a volunteer operator working from home or in a safe room inside the hospital. The teleoperator will guide LHF Connect toward each patient's bed using a laptop or a smartphone. LHF Connect is an open-source platform that leverages mature robotics technologies designed to be easily reproducible even in extreme conditions such as lockdown situations. The platform was reproduced during the first pandemic outbreak in Europe by other people independently, and it has been tested by medical staff in real scenarios and isolated Covid 19 departments.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the last two decades, a lot of new technological advancements and developments have taken place in the field of healthcare. These advancements have helped to improve people’s living standards and have increased the global life expectancy. However, the current healthcare system is facing a huge burden due to the increasing cases of chronic diseases like cancer, diabetes, etc., and the way our healthcare system which is running currently has proved to be quite inefficient. In this research paper, our focus will be on how 5G technology can revolutionize our healthcare system and resolving challenges posed by our current healthcare system. 5G technology offers features like low latency, high-speed connectivity, and many other features that can prove to be the game-changer when it comes to healthcare. Impact of 5G on the medical access, quality, and cost will also make some recommendations that such as data policies, research needs, effective regulations, infrastructure developments, trials, etc., that will lead to a better, safer, and quality healthcare in future without ignoring the fundamental rights of the individuals.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Performance assessment for GuidedWave (GW)-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems is of major importance for industrial deployment. With conventional feature extraction methods like damage indices, path-based probability of detection (POD) analysis can be realized. To achieve reliability quantification enough data needs to be available, which is rarely the case. Alternatives like methods for performance assessment on system level are still in development and in a discussion phase. In this contribution, POD results using an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based data analysis are compared with those delivered by conventional data analysis. Using an open-access dataset from Open Guided Wave platform, the possibility of performance assessment for GW-based SHM systems using AI-based data analysis is shown in detail. An artificial neural network (ANN) classifier is trained to detect artificial damage in a stiffened CFRP plate. As input for the ANN, classical damage indicators are used. The ANN is tested to detect damage at another position, whose inspection data were not previously used in training. The findings show very high detection capabilities without sorting any specific path but only having a global view of current damage metrics. The systematic evaluation of the ANN predictions with respect to specific damage sizes allows to compute a probability of correct identification versus flaw dimension, somehow equivalent to and compared with the results achieved through classic path-based POD analysis. Also, sensitive paths are detected by ANN predictions allowing for evaluation of maximal distances between path and damage position. Finally, it is shown that the prediction performance of the ANN can be improved significantly by combining different damage indicators as inputs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Effective communication and coordination between government agencies and the general public are important to manage disaster risks and mitigate the risks involved to the public. The main objectives of developing awareness, sending information to the public on time and facilitating swift community responses can be achieved by adopting social media platforms blended with existing communication mechanisms. At present, many government agencies and government officials use social media platforms as one of the leading information dissemination mechanisms. This study was conducted by means of a case study, considering the information dissemination through official Facebook pages maintained by health authorities during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka. Primary data were collected through the “Health Promotion Bureau” (HPB) Facebook page, the official page dedicated to sharing health-related information with the community. The social network analysis considered changes in the content at the different stages of the pandemic, languages and the different interfaces used to disseminate information. The number of shares was regarded as active participation, which implies the engagements of followers. Two interaction networks were developed to identify the trends and patterns in information dissemination via social media. Further, this study focussed on the influence of pandemic situations on the HPB page followers’ interaction through statistical analysis. Derived interaction networks for different languages showed that posts related to pandemic behaviour and COVID-19 symptoms, etc., have low centrality value. Similarly, the interface interaction network revealed that HPB had used a standard method of reporting particular information like situational updates of COVID-19 in terms of interface. Statistical analysis on the number of shares for different interfaces revealed that the posts with text and image have a higher possibility of sharing by a Facebook user. Quantitative analysis shows that users are sensitive to daily COVID-19 positive cases, although the initial interaction for the HPB's page was reduced. Users tend to share the daily COVID-19 report posted by the page whenever a cluster was identified, as it leads to an increment in the rate of reporting infected cases.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This chapter examines Weapon Product Placement (WPP), the sponsored use of recognisable branded firearms in screen dramas, with a particular focus on depictions of police gun violence in mainstream police television dramas. By exploring the media theory constructs of priming and the copycat effect, we suggest that depictions of police gun violence, which are overwhelmingly positive, contribute to a widespread misunderstanding of policing and the role of violence within policing. We argue that the valorisation of police gun violence on screen is not harmless. It runs counter to well-established and often-codified obligations on police to use minimum levels of force in all circumstances and helps create unrealistic and undesirable public expectations of how police are armed and go about their work and especially of how critical incidents should be resolved. We suggest that WPP should be banned, or at least better regulated, and that classification schemes should be changed to ensure that depictions of policing conform to the doctrine of minimum force. We also suggest that police agencies use their influence over screen producers to ensure that depictions of policing are framed by the minimum force doctrine. (This chapter expands our examination of WPP in ‘“The Devil’s Right Hand”: Policing, Media and Weapons Product Placement’ (Evans and Farmer. Do police need guns?: Policing and firearms: Past, present and future. Springer, 2021, Chap. 7)).',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This research aims at empirically investigating the effect of fear accompanied with the outbreak of COVID-19 on the emerging panic buying behavior in Palestine. Fear dimensions are assumed as reasons for the emergence of panic buying behavior, and include fear of infection, fear of food scarcity, fear of job loss, and fear of crime. This study included an online survey of a convenience sample of 367 reached through electronically administered questionnaire using e-mail and social media platforms. The research hypotheses were tested using multiple linear regression. The results show that the fear of infection, fear of food scarcity, fear of job loss, and fear of crime are predicting higher scores of panic buying behavior. The research findings contribute to existing knowledge on panic buying behavior as the research is uniquely theorizing and testing the mechanisms, by which such psychological dimensions of fear, worked in explaining buyer panic behavior during the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic; where prior research is lacking. Furthermore, this research represents a core point of intersection between two different, yet interdependent disciplines - consumer behavior and psychology. The current research conceptual model uses psychological construct (fear) to explain consumer behavior construct (panic buying). This study provides valuable information and insights on implementing appropriate policies and strategies to mitigate public fear and curb panic buying during pandemic times.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Roadways play an essential role in today’s society by contributing to economic growth and development, providing access to all members of society and fast routes to travel on efficiently. With increased numbers of vehicles on the roads, the quality of the roads is deteriorating at a faster rate than can be maintained and repaired. This decrease in road health materializes as hazards such as potholes that can cause significant damage to vehicles on the road. Currently, roads’ health is monitored manually and thus done infrequently due to it being both time-consuming and costly for the responsible local transit authorities. Therefore, many road quality issues are repeatedly reported by the people who drive on them before any inspection or repair efforts are undertaken by the transit authorities. This manual process of reporting potholes and other road hazards is an inefficient process requiring filling out forms or making phone calls while remembering the exact location of the pothole or road hazard. This chapter presents Drive Health , an Internet of Things (IoT) system developed to crowdsource the monitoring of the health of roadways by informing transit authorities of pothole locations. Drive Health includes a smart sensor and performs machine learning on accelerometer data to process and analyze the data without using the cloud. If the system determines that the data indicates the existence of a pothole, the location of where the data was collected is recorded and sent to a web server which can then be automatically shared with the transit authorities responsible for that road location.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Muscle stem cells Muscle stem cell , also known as satellite cells Satellite cell , are responsible for the regenerative capacity of adult muscle tissue in response to stress and injury. Upon regenerative stimuli, satellite cells are activated and undergo myogenic commitment. Myogenic progenitors, which are termed myoblasts Myoblast , undergo rapid proliferation, propagation, and differentiation into myocytes, which then fuse with each other to form new myotubes or to a pre-existing myotube. This process of myogenic differentiation is metabolically demanding and involves cellular remodeling of organelles and cellular architecture. Autophagy Autophagy , a catabolic mechanism involving the sequestration of cellular contents into double membrane autophagosome vesicles, is strongly implicated at various stages during myogenesis Myogenesis ; from the satellite stem cell to the mature muscle tissue. Moreover, aberrant autophagy (both the overstimulation and inhibition of autophagy) in both satellite cells Satellite cell and mature muscle cells can be detrimental for muscle health and physiology. This chapter outlines the importance of autophagy in maintaining skeletal muscle Skeletal muscle tissue homeostasis and satellite cell regenerative capacity.',\n",

It is concluded that important aspects of human vulnerability appear largely overlooked in traditional fire safety practices and need to be addressed much more seriously if deaths and injuries are to be significantly reduced. When residential fires exceptionally lead to serious harm, it is often due to certain medical, functional, and/or social vulnerabilities of the victim. Since the same vulnerabilities tend to put residents at risk of many other health and safety hazards as well, the fire safety community should join efforts with health and social resources to develop broader programs for safer housing among vulnerable groups, including fire safety. As part of this, new and innovative fire-related solutions are urgently needed to better compensate for human shortcomings in the event of a fire at home.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Bioactive compounds possess the ability to interact with living tissues and impact cellular activities. Concerning human beings, these bioactive components exhibit a wide range of health benefits upon interacting with different physiological systems. Flavonoids, tannins, anthocyanins, carotenoids, betalains, plant sterols, and glucosinolates are few examples of bioactive compounds. They are found primarily in fruits and vegetables. Multiple research studies are being conducted to verify their role in the prevention and possible reversal of cancer and cardiometabolic disorders, such as diabetes, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. Available data and research indicate their role as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant components, facilitating hormonal regulation, immune system modulation, and anticarcinogenic activities. This chapter discusses the impact of bioactive compounds on hormonal regulation in humans. For instance, flavonoids mediate antidiabetic activity by modulating carbohydrate metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Some bioactive compounds have been reported to exhibit neuroprotective effects. Omega-3 fatty acids, phenolics (lignin and tannins), and plant sterol esters can alleviate the risk of cardiovascular disorders and atherosclerosis by reducing inflammation, LDL cholesterol level, and oxidative stress. The chapter also discusses the latest sustainable methods developed to extract and produce bioactive compounds via different kinds of green technologies like microwave-assisted extraction and ultrasound-assisted extraction.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This study examines the performance of the refined time-reversal method (RTRM), which recommends best reconstruction frequency as probing frequency and uses an extended mode of the reconstructed signal for computing the damage/similarity index for damage detection under a varying thermal environment. The experiments were performed on a 3\\xa0mm aluminum plate with a block mass-type damage at three excitation frequencies: the best reconstruction frequency, the sweet spot frequency at which only $$S_0$$ S 0 mode is actuated, and an arbitrarily chosen frequency. Measurements were taken at two temperatures, 25\\xa0 $$^\\\\circ $$ ∘ C and 50\\xa0 $$^\\\\circ $$ ∘ C. The percent similarity between the reconstructed and original input signals showed a consistent decrease with the increase in damage height at the best reconstruction frequency. However, at the other excitation frequencies, the change in the similarity with the increase in damage height did not follow a consistent trend, which can lead to erroneous information about damage size. The percent similarity changes significantly with temperature rise at the sweet spot frequency and the arbitrarily chosen frequency. However, it showed minimal change with temperature rise at the best reconstruction frequency for undamaged and damaged states of different severity, making the RTRM suitable for baseline-free damage detection and sizing even under temperature variations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the context of Guided Wave-based Structural Health Monitoring (GW-SHM), ultrasonic elastic waves are used to detect damages in structures by comparing the acquired signals with those from a defect-free structure. However, the high sensitivity of GWs to environmental and operational conditions limits the validity of such references. Notably, variabilities between multiple specimens are often significant from the GWs perspective. These variabilities are particularly important in composites and are due to sensor positioning, sensor coupling and material variability. This communication presents a baseline-free approach using physics-enhanced Machine Learning (ML) for enhanced robustness. To ensure the coverage of these variabilities the approach is validated on multiple Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP) panels. The methodology relies on feature extraction from raw GW signals and training classification algorithms (e.g., kernel machines, neural networks). To make the classifier learn inter-specimen variabilities, an experimental database of 45 impacted composite panels is used. Half of them are used to provide pristine data, and the rest to provide damaged data so that the same sample is either in the training or test set, but never in both. Good classification performance is obtained, demonstrating that the classifier has successfully learnt to recognize defect signatures despite the variability linked to the multiple specimens and instrumentations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Nanotechnology has already become the frontier of the twenty-first century. It plays the role of a scientific platform joining together various disciplines such as chemistry, physics, and material sciences. The development of modern technology is largely dependent on the availability of new types of materials; therefore, the nanostructured approach seems to be one of the key determinants of progress in general. The example of an innovative application for nanoparticles can be the protection of wood and wood-based composites against fire. The demand for these types of raw materials and wood-containing products is constantly growing; however, the directions of their applications may still expand with the use of effective protection measures. The choice of mineral nanomaterials, nano-oxides, nano-metals, or carbon-based nanomaterials for this use seems to be particularly reasonable due to their wide range of favorable features such as good barrier properties, high thermal conductivity, and many others. The already presented research concerns both the addition of the nanomaterials themselves and the implementation of nanomaterials in a combination with other fire retardants. They were found to be effective when incorporated into the wood plastic composites as the additives for polymers, wood-based materials as modifiers for fragmented wood and the adhesives, solid wood, and coating systems. Moreover, the addition of nanomaterials has a positive effect on many other properties of wood and wood products. It is especially important since these properties also determine the suitability in some applications. Taking into account the unique properties of nanomaterials and the constantly growing attention focused on the studies regarding their use in fire protection, this chapter presents the current knowledge on the development of new nanostructured solutions and suspensions for wood products protection against fire with special emphasis on mineral nanomaterials (montmorillonite, sepiolite, and wollastonite), nano-oxides (nano-silica and nano-metal oxides), nano-silver, and carbon-based nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes and graphene platelets).',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In order to prevent the extraordinary spread of sickness caused by Flavivirus, the healthcare business as well as public health are working tirelessly. Individual lives have been affected, but mosquito-infested public locations have made a considerable influence on the general public’s health. Site adaptability, climate change, and inadequate healthcare services and surveillance all contribute to the spread of the virus. The potential dangers of this virus, on the other hand, have been uncovered through extensive and ongoing research in the healthcare business. Modern healthcare facilities may benefit from the reasoning capabilities and ever-evolving analysis techniques provided by artificial intelligence. More conclusive findings have been demonstrated in the realm of AI applications in healthcare domains such as cancer, neurology, and cardiology. A number of research works have justified the use of AI-oriented algorithms for intelligently handling unstructured and huge healthcare data. When it comes to using artificial intelligence (AI) to identify, forecast, diagnose, and treat disease using data from public health and biological databases, the current effort aims to undertake an extensive examination. There may be issues in integrating assistive technology into the current healthcare system, as well. Because of this review, we hope that by merging AI research with clinical and public health specialists, critical knowledge may be extracted from data in order to unchain the relevant information of Flavivirus disease from its chains.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'One of the sectors which plays a vital role in the development of India from the past few years is construction which includes most of the unskilled workers engaged through this sector. It is being considered as one of the most unorganized fields due to various factors such as most of workers (laborers) are not having basic education, laborers are migrated from one state to another in search of job, and responsibilities are not fixed as most of the activities get changed within in a shorter duration of time. It becomes quite difficult for a woman to survive in such type of male-dominant sector. If comparison is done, men join as unskilled laborer but get skilled in the later half but such things does not hold true for the women. This paper would be dealing with the various issues which a woman faces in a construction site with respect to the existing musculoskeletal disorders, disparity of wages, promotional chances, equality, discrimination, harassment, etc. Apart from the site issues, there is huge mental stress in order to maintain the balance between their personal and professional life as most of the women seem to postpone their family planning.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Aims/hypothesis We examined the contribution of rare HNF1A variants to type 2 diabetes risk and age of diagnosis, and the extent to which their impact is affected by overall genetic susceptibility, across three ancestry groups. Methods Using exome sequencing data of 160,615 individuals of the UK Biobank and 18,797 individuals of the Bio Me Biobank, we identified 746 carriers of rare functional HNF1A variants (minor allele frequency ≤1%), of which 507 carry variants in the functional domains. We calculated polygenic risk scores (PRSs) based on genome-wide association study summary statistics for type 2 diabetes, and examined the association of HNF1A variants and PRS with risk of type 2 diabetes and age of diagnosis. We also tested whether the PRS affects the association between HNF1A variants and type 2 diabetes risk by including an interaction term. Results Rare HNF1A variants that are predicted to impair protein function are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes in individuals of European ancestry (OR 1.46, p =0.049), particularly when the variants are located in the functional domains (OR 1.89, p =0.002). No association was observed for individuals of African ancestry (OR 1.10, p =0.60) or Hispanic-Latino ancestry (OR 1.00, p =1.00). Rare functional HNF1A variants were associated with an earlier age at diagnosis in the Hispanic-Latino population (β=−5.0 years, p =0.03), and this association was marginally more pronounced for variants in the functional domains (β=−5.59 years, p =0.03). No associations were observed for other ancestries (African ancestry β=−2.7 years, p =0.13; European ancestry β=−3.5 years, p =0.20). A higher PRS was associated with increased odds of type 2 diabetes in all ancestries (OR 1.61–2.11, p <10 −5 ) and an earlier age at diagnosis in individuals of African ancestry (β=−1.4 years, p =3.7 × 10 −6 ) and Hispanic-Latino ancestry (β=−2.4 years, p <2 × 10 −16 ). Furthermore, a higher PRS exacerbated the effect of the functional HNF1A variants on type 2 diabetes in the European ancestry population ( p interaction =0.037). Conclusions/interpretation We show that rare functional HNF1A variants, in particular those located in the functional domains, increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, at least among individuals of European ancestry. Their effect is even more pronounced in individuals with a high polygenic susceptibility. Our analyses highlight the importance of the location of functional variants within a gene and an individual’s overall polygenic susceptibility, and emphasise the need for more genetic data in non-European populations.

       "  'abstract': 'With the changes in the way we communicate and collaborate, lifelong learners are facing new requirements, opportunities, and challenges. One technology holds promise to facilitate lifelong learning via a unique quasi-synchronous communicative mode: mobile instant messaging (MIM). In this study, we operationalized lifelong learning in the context of professional adult education as learning that goes beyond instruction-driven pedagogy in formal learning contexts. Inspired by the theory of heutagogy, we conducted an extensive review of the research and reported on the contexts, approaches, benefits, and challenges of using MIM in professional learning. The results show that related studies had just started to emerge in recent years (since 2017) and focused mainly on two MIM services – WeChat and WhatsApp. MIM were mainly used by professionals such as teachers and doctors, as well as people in need of professional help. People used MIM tools to establish online communities of practices, disseminate knowledge, and seek for help. We identified an array of beneficial features of MIM to support lifelong learning, including ease of use, multimodality, immediacy, continuance, flexibility, and comfort. The challenges of using MIM to support lifelong learning include the size limit of WhatsApp groups, the chronological features, the intrusiveness of irrelevant messages, and the concerns over user privacy. This work makes a theoretical contribution by researching heutagogy in the unique research context of MIM use in lifelong learning and provides practical evidence and suggestions for practitioners to better utilize technologies to engage learners in lifelong learning activities.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Understanding medical and biological factors affecting survivability in fires provide a solid ground for safety and preventive measures. Most fire Fires deaths are due to (smoke) inhalation injuries Inhalation injuries alone or in combination with burns Burns . Smoke is a complex mixture of compounds that cause harm through Asphyxia, Acute irritation, Physical exposure, and Long-term effects. Not only the present incident and the acute setting are important, the following period also holds a substantial morbidity Morbidity and mortality Mortality . Risk groups Risk groups such as men, smokers, alcohol−/drug-impaired, physically disabled or cognitively impaired, and elderly have been identified. The global number of elderly people has increased significantly and is projected to continue increase rapidly. While considering their own safety, emergency medical services need to quickly identify injured patients to promptly initiate life-saving interventions such as securing airways and providing O 2 counteracting the effects of inhaled toxic gases. Minor burns Burns and smoke expositions can be treated ambulatory with routine wound care or a short period of O 2 inhalation. However, larger burns Burns and inhalation injuries Inhalation injuries are often serious and need advanced treatment in hospital. Different biological and/or medical factors that can explain, or identify, persons more vulnerable Vulnerable than others to fire Fires , smoke, or heat incidences are reviewed in this chapter. Given the short amount of time at hand to escape a fire Fires situation, measures to extend this time must be taken; however, prevention is really the key. Environmental modifications, safety rules promotion, etc. need to be tailored to specific groups; children do not function as adults, psychiatric disabled differ from physically disabled, etc.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The rates of obsessive behaviors were increased during the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to the preventive precautions against this virus. The study aimed to identify the prevalence and associated factors of obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) during COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional design was used to assess the OCD among general population sample. A simple random sampling technique (n\\u2009=\\u2009421) was used for data collection. The data collected using a questionnaire (Yale-Brown Scale) for OCD. The prevalence of obsessive-compulsive behavior symptoms among the participants was (47.0%) during COVID-19 Pandemic. People with other diseases like hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and others were 2.4 times more likely to have OCD when compared to others from healthy people. Furthermore, who have COVID-19 were twice as likely to develop OCD as non-infected people. On the other hand, People who did not adhere to safety procedures were 0.31 times less likely to develop OCD than others who closely adhered to these procedures. Besides, the study showed that people previously diagnosed with OCD are at 4.95 times risk of worsening their condition during this pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on the behavior of the Palestinian population, the majority of the participants have symptoms of OCD, and who had OCD have worsened their condition during the COVID-19 pandemic.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Diabetes mellitus is a treatable disease characterized by persistent hyperglycemia. Its prevalence is spiraling out of control, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The early diagnosis of diabetes can reduce the risk of complications. The use of biomarkers may facilitate this. Indeed, several biomarkers are currently used in routine clinical practice. Yet, these have limitations, and novel biomarkers have been developed using “omic” technologies and other analytical platforms. Thus, the knowledge and awareness of this subject has developed in recent years. It is challenging even for well-established researchers to keep abreast of research related to biomarkers of diabetes or to employ those resources used or recommended by other experts or practitioners in the field. To assist, we have compiled a list of resources as recommended by active practitioners and researchers. These tables include information on regulatory bodies, societies, other organizations, books, journals\\xa0and other resource materials of practical use.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Since the early civil Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications, the need for effective tools to characterize the structural response under varying environmental conditions has been recognized as a critical factor for SHM reliability. As a consequence, the current structural condition as well as relevant historical data have to be taken into account to have an up-to-date representation of the actual physical system in operation. Digital twins can play a primary role in the evaluation of the current condition of the structure and in anomaly detection to support structural maintenance. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is currently showing a potential in this perspective thanks to the possibility of collecting miscellaneous data and information in a unified platform; however, its extension to facility management is an open issue, in particular when the digital models have to be complemented with data coming from SHM systems. So, an effective integration between the two is highly desirable. The present paper aims at demonstrating how relevant information coming from SHM systems can be integrated into a BIM model of a structure to make them available for interrogation and further analyses. The development of a digital twin of a historical structure combining SHM data, BIM, and finite element model updating is illustrated pointing out its promising applicative perspectives for structural maintenance.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Measurement in the social sciences is typically characterized by a multitude of instruments that are assumed to measure the same concept but lack comparability. Underdeveloped conceptual theories that fail to expose a measurement mechanism are one reason for the incommensurable measurements. Without such a mechanism measurements cannot be linked to a fundamental reference as required by metrological traceability. However, traditional metrological concepts can be extended by allowing for direct links between different instruments, so-called crosswalks. In this regard, Rasch Measurement Theory proves particularly useful as it facilitates a co-calibration of different instruments onto a common metric. The example of the measurement of nicotine dependence through self-report instruments serves as a showcase of the problems in social measurement and how they can be overcome contributing to metrological traceability in the social sciences.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER. Its acronym in Spanish) is a public healthcare institution that provides medical attention, teaching and scientific research centered on diseases of the respiratory system. In 2019, the hospital held 228 beds and over six thousand medical devices for diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of patients. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic pushed the Hospital to convert 215 conventional care beds to intensive care beds, assigned exclusively to critical COVID-19 patients. This resulted in a higher demand of Health Technology Management (HTM) resources which were reflected by a 60% increase in the Hospital’s medical devices. Therefore, the technical staff of the Department of Biomedical Engineering grew by 300%. Thus, the objective of this work was to innovate HTM procedures through the application of Six Sigma Methodology and two Lean tools: 5S and Kanban, to control the activities carried out at the Hospital. Procedures for dealing with work orders and inventory control of supplies (accessories, consumables, and spare parts) that medical equipment require for its operation were analyzed. Additionally, three activities related to HTM were analyzed: tool control, work area control and information flow among all 5 personnel work shifts. In total, seven innovation strategies were proposed and implemented in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the INER.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This chapter adds philosophical interpretation to the book’s central themes, derived from The Ontology of Well-Being Thesis (TOWT) and defended throughout the book, so as to understand further how well-being might be better conceptualised and promoted. The main argument, to be developed in Chap. 9 the final chapter, is based on three assertions defended here. First, there is a distinction between, what is called, explanatory and purpose-based approaches to understanding well-being and its promotion in social policy and welfare practice. These approaches reflect two very different accounts of ontology, epistemology, and normativity, which have been uncovered and explored. Second, without siding with one over the other, a pluralist response is recommended, arguing that both the explanatory and purpose based approaches should be promoted simultaneously. The main claim is that this pluralist response underpins a fully articulated understanding of TOWT, helping to make better sense of debates in social policy and welfare practice which intend to enhance well-being for populations. Third, a pluralist response also claims that the dichotomy between ‘subjective’ and ‘objective’ categories of well-being, while can be important to maintain politically, at least in certain circumstances, is a distinction that can break down, or become very blurred, philosophically speaking. As argued here and throughout the book, philosophically a false dichotomy between these categories of well-being is revealed when examining complex and conflicting human experiences, and particularly if the six ontological features of the human condition identified in TOWT and in Chap. 2 , are fully recognised and accommodated.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Fiber optical grating (FBG) sensors offer several advantages such as small size, ability to be embedded, and insensitivity to magnetic and electric fields, and hence are widely used for monitoring in several sectors. FBG sensors are most commonly used for strain-based structural health monitoring (SHM), but recent developments are also focused on using them for guided waves (GW) based SHM. The coupling of the GW to the fiber is a very complex phenomenon and needs to be studied in detail. The numerical studies with optical fibers are computationally expensive due to the small mesh size needed for capturing the wave propagation. Also, the conversion of the strain profile from the numerical model to the spectral response of the FBG sensor is a non-trivial process needing complex matrix manipulations. Thus, in this paper, a tool for the visualization of the FBG spectrum change subjected to GW is developed. A GUI based tool is developed and validated with experiments to allow easy visualization of the FBG response by the engineers. Through the use of the tool, the fiber need not be modeled thus making the numerical analysis less demanding.',\n",

To test the validity of these hypotheses, the administrative records systematized by the Brazilian Forum of Public Safety (FBSP, acronym in Portuguese) and the Mortality Information System (SIM, acronym in Portuguese) were organized in a panel dataset, which was used to estimate Poisson regression models.

       "  'abstract': 'Acoustic emission testing remains a popular technique in the SHM community due to its effectiveness in detecting and localising small occurrences of damage in a structure. One of the characteristics of acoustic emissions is that all structures will produce some level of emission even if only benign flaws are present. As such, it is often necessary to collect a baseline reference set of data against which newly collected measurements can be compared to establish the state of the structure. In this work, a methodology is proposed which eliminates the need for this “training phase” through use of a statistical model which learns and adapts online. The chosen technique is a Bayesian online changepoint detection method where bursts of acoustic emission are modelled as a Poisson point process. In this way the inherent stochasticity in the number of “hits” emitted in a given window is learnt and modelled online, then significant changes in the properties of the generating stochastic model are used to provide sensitivity to damage. This approach has a number of benefits which are demonstrated on an experimental dataset from a bearing test rig. The main benefit is removing the need to collect extensive data before the SHM system can become operational. The proposed solution also allows prior engineering knowledge to be exploited, for instance by specifying priors related to the expected number of hits in a given window, or through use of a Hazard Function which encodes prior belief about the expected time before damage will occur. Finally, the method is shown to characterise the full probability distribution over possible run lengths. This information provides not only an indication of if a significant change in the behaviour of the system has occurred, but also automatically quantifies a degree of confidence in that change.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Swedish Transport Administration (STA) work to reduce the number of suicides in the transport system. Fatalities, i.e., on roads, railways, and bridges, originate from either accidents or suicides, natural death excluded. Knowing the correct manner of death is needed to work with optimal prevention strategies. The aims are to separate fatalities due to suicides, follow the development, and implement measures for suicide prevention. Methods are developed for suicide classification and criteria for the selection in which suicides were suspected. Fatalities in level one and two of five were classified as suicides. Data from the STA’s databases are used and so are data from the psychosocial investigations done by a trained investigator in the topic and with clinical experience from counselling at hospitals. 2129 persons died on the roads in Sweden, 10% (206 persons) were classified as suicides. 336 persons died after being hit by trains, 85% (284 persons) were suicides. 130 persons died by jumping from bridges. The number of suicides increases with population density. Suicide in the transport system is a major problem; firstly personal tragedies, it is also a work environment problem for truck and train drivers and for the emergency staff. It generates delays and costs for passenger and cargo transport. By analyzing the results of countermeasures in the form of obstructive barriers, the physical environment can be improved and high-risk areas can be accentuated. Restricting access to the means of suicide is important in suicide prevention. Strategies for the STA include suicide prevention in the design of new roads, railways, and bridges, as well as by identifying and reducing existing high-risk locations. Sharing the results with other authorities and organizations and cooperation within suicide prevention missions are vital for the enhancement of the overall suicide prevention work in society.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In Switzerland, the federal government reacted quite effectively in the main critical junctures of the pandemic crisis, especially in the first phase of the pandemic. An experimentalist approach had been applied to cope with a situation of high uncertainty, according to which public authorities have been able to learn and readapt their strategy along the way. However, in other instances, when the crisis seemed to wane or at least reduced its intensity, policy decisions were made following a more conventional pattern of polarized consociationalism, whereby different types of political actors—especially political parties and business representatives—were able to reshape and partially co-determine the policy outputs, against the background a policy process that is characteristically open to societal inputs. The second and the fourth stage of the pandemic, corresponding to summer to early winter 2020 and, respectively, late spring to autumn 2021, displayed indeed more politicization, resulting in a reactive rather than anticipatory attitude of policymakers.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The wake of the COVID-19 pandemic has yet again highlighted how vital immunization is for public health. Despite the dramatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, there is a rising trend of people refusing to be vaccinated. As a result, governments and health experts must gather and understand public ideas and perceptions about vaccines to design engagement and education efforts about vaccine advantages. Sentiment analysis is a common method for acquiring a broad picture of public opinion, that enables the classification of people as those who are in favor or against vaccination, as well as the determination of the factors that influence their attitudes and beliefs. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the general approach to sentiment analysis in the context of vaccinations and review its different use cases. The chapter’s experimental component integrates the utilization of a dataset retrieved from Kaggle, which contains COVID-19 vaccine-related Twitter data. When attempting to perform sentiment analysis, certain methodological steps need to be considered after data collection, including data pre-processing, technique selection and model construction, as well as model evaluation and results interpretation. Both supervised and unsupervised sentiment analysis methods are investigated in the model construction step, with the former involving the implementation of Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression algorithms, and the latter involving the use of TextBlob and Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) sentiment analysis tools. The performance of each algorithm and tool is evaluated, as is the performance of each sentiment detection approach in order to select the best performing one. Social media platforms have become a common source of information and misinformation regarding vaccines. Our effort aims to emphasize the importance of mining such readily available public attitudes, as well as forecast opinions and reactions related to vaccine uptake in near real-time. Such insights could be critical in dealing with health emergency situations like the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Higher education has been the first frontier for inclusion debate and discourse, yet when examining gender equity in this space, as one sphere of inclusion, it’s questionable whether it offers a place of inclusion itself. Traditionally, the professional structure of higher education has provided restricted employment, career, and leadership opportunities for women, which is exacerbated where there is an intersection with race, culture, religion, or age. Women continue to be underrepresented in academia across various disciplines and this lack of representation in senior positions within the professional structure of higher education itself acts as a barrier to more women reaching senior levels within institutions. More women are needed in higher positions to increase representation and visibility, to be truly inclusive of all, and to encourage and mentor others to then aspire to follow a similar path. This critical review examines gender equity across the major career benchmarks of the academy in light of the impact of the personal contexts of women, systemic processes that hinder career progression, inclusion and cultural barriers that impede promotion and career progression. Research-based systemic, inclusive solutions are discussed that work towards improved gender equity for all women. The findings from this critical review highlight the need for systemic change globally in higher education to create equities that are inclusionary in the employment, career, and leadership opportunities for women.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'During past years, the pandemic has revealed the importance of having a solid care system prepared to face emergencies. In this context, digital solutions demonstrated a high potential in dealing with critical conditions and ensuring the delivery of care. However, telemedicine has not yet succeeded in becoming a stable part of ordinary care. The integration of innovative telemedicine technologies with a set of well-organized activities plays a crucial role in the release of high-quality services. Processes modeling before the introduction of telemedicine services is a leverage to prepare the base for an effective and efficient shift to digital care. Hence, the present research customizes a modeling technique in four steps for a preliminary analysis of processes where to introduce televisits. A special attention is given to the collection of consistent knowledge about care processes, often lack and incomplete in public hospitals scenarios. The approach has been applied to the AS-IS process of the heart failure clinic of a large Italian hospital before the introduction of televisits. Integrated Definition for Function Modeling (IDEF) diagrams have allowed the hierarchical decomposition of complex phases in simpler tasks, the acquisition of consciousness and the updating of information. Diagrams have been created and used as a source of a common language to discuss about weaknesses of the current process and its possible improvements. Obstacles to the upcoming televisits services have been objectively highlighted, such as the need to reduce employed applications, the removal of printed material and the streamlining of unnecessary operations.',\n",

This chapter describes the methodology identified and carried out in the HEALPS2 project to efficiently reach and engage stakeholders of Alpine NHT and to form a stakeholder group at the transnational level (including the engagement of EU-level ac-tors and networks). Based on the Quadruple Helix concept, the methodology integrates a process of stakeholder engagement and endorsement along three steps; the identification of the key points and the problems to be tackled for a successful stakeholder engagement; and the development of Regional and Transnational Stakeholder Groups that extend to the cooperation with EU-wide networks. Developing health tourism products and service chains, and sustaining them with strategies and policies, is a complex undertaking. The adoption of the stakeholder engagement approaches throughout the HEALPS2 project showed that it is of utmost importance to properly identify, involve and communicate with the stakeholders who effectively complement the success of the project, and its outcomes, in enhancing NHT competitiveness.',\n",

As healthcare information must be kept private and secure, information security and privacy preserving are the most crucial issues to be handled in healthcare. This paper analyzes and identifies the most pertinent security and privacy issues in existing healthcare systems. To resolve the privacy and security issues, blockchain innovation can act as a robust solution as blockchain technology uses cryptography and consensus verification as basic perspectives alongside decentralized architecture and immutable blocks of data. Various consensus and encryption algorithms of the blockchain technology have been studied in depth, and an overview has been presented in the paper. A novel blockchain-based patient health record (BB-PHR) system is proposed with improvised consensus mechanisms and enhanced encryption levels for medical data access control and protection in the paper. The system enforces consensus verification of patient and hospital administration both for maintaining privacy and tamper proof data access. Proposed system integrates encryption algorithms, access control mechanisms, and smart contract on a blockchain framework comprehensively to address the security and privacy vulnerabilities of a health record. With such a system, we can implement severe access and security control on healthcare information.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This study aims to determine the success of using the PeduliLindungi application in Indonesia. The government created the PeduliLindungi application in dealing with COVID-19 in Indonesia, integrated nationally. The PeduliLindungi application is one of the government’s breakthroughs in handling the COVID-19 pandemic. The PeduliLindungi application has several challenges: how people trust the application, the role of the application in daily life, and how the government can make a strategy so that people are sure of using the PeduliLindungi application. The data used in this study is a qualitative descriptive data and Twitter data related to public responses. This study used a QDAS approach to analyze the NVIVO Plus 12 software. The results showed that the PeduliLindungi application provided convenience to users through the features on the application offered. The PeduliLindungi application components include COVID-19 test results, Ehac, teledokter, COVID-19 statistical information, and vaccination registration. The government also has a good strategy in convincing the public to use the PeduliLindungi application by making rules that explain the obligation to use the PeduliLindungi application in daily life during the COVID-19 pandemic. This rule makes the number of PeduliLindungi application users increase each month. However, the PeduliLindungi application also received criticism from application users regarding complaints in using the PeduliLindungi application, such as application errors, data leaks, and user data errors. This criticism can be used as an evaluation material for the government to improve the quality of the PeduliLindungi application.',\n",

These structures will have the ability of sensing and will be accurately able to respond to the changes in the environment and external damages. To be able to keep up with the advancements we need to detect the damages to monitor the health of the structure. This research study aims to develop an efficient damage detection method using video of the damaged structure taken by mobile or camera mounted on a drone to replace the human visual inspection using Artificial Intelligence. For this system, an AI-based application is developed that will be able to recognize the damages accurately in the bounding box or targeted limiting area via a portable camera.

       "  'abstract': 'The boom is the key load-bearing component of the crane, and its health seriously threatens the service performance of the crane. In order to ensure the safe production of cranes, nondestructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM) of boom become more and more urgent and important. In this paper, the intelligent defect location algorithm based on helical guided waves is applied to the weld defect detection of U-shaped boom. Intelligent defect location algorithm is an imaging algorithm that combines ellipse imaging principle, evolutionary algorithm and K-means clustering algorithm. This paper verifies the effectiveness of this algorithm for weld defect location of U-shaped boom through experimental research. Firstly, the propagation regularity of helical guided waves in the U-shaped boom structure is studied. In addition, the elliptical imaging algorithm is used to image and analyze the weld defects in the U-shaped boom, and the location of the defects is preliminarily determined. The defect location analysis of weld defects is carried out by using the intelligent defect location algorithm. By comparing the imaging results of the two methods, it is found that the intelligent defect location algorithm has higher resolution and can effectively improve the defect location accuracy. This algorithm provides a tool for health monitoring of special-shaped structures based on guided waves.',\n",

Entomophagy is one such option, which already has a long history and is currently being eaten by approximately 2 billion people in 113 countries. Insects are a rich source of macro- and micro-nutrients, which are equivalent or sometimes even exceed the amounts present in usual animal food commonly being consumed by humans. Consumption of insects as food is not going to be beneficial just for humans but has environmental and socio-economic benefits as well. The consumption of insects can be increased by addressing the problem of insects being considered as nasty and disgusting by disseminating knowledge regarding its benefits. With increasing development of the insect food industry, there is a need for the development and implementation of insect legislation regulations in the world. Further research is needed to increase insect production and commercialization. The chapter focuses on the history of entomophagy, the main orders of insects being consumed, its benefits as food and also risks associated with insect consumption.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This study explores student experiences of online learning during the global COVID19 pandemic. The paper assesses whether the outcomes of constructivist inquiry-based learning can still be achieved online. A qualitative research approach was used to survey online learning experiences of students. A total of 27 registered Construction Studies university students conveniently sampled across all levels of study completed a questionnaire with close ended questions. The data collection was computed and analysed using SPSS version 27. Mean values, standard deviations and reliability values were computed. Results of the survey indicated that most students spent more time doing work during online learning. Students indicated that they were able to think more critically and discuss concepts and collaborate with other students. There was a handful of students that were more stressed, socially inactive and lacked outdoor activity due to online learning. The sample is drawn from a single university in South Africa and findings cannot be generalized across all student populations.',\n",

This report is a systematic literature review of the usability and safety of medical devices used extensively for patient care. Safety has been broadly considered to mean in-patient safety and improving patient care. As part of the literature review and bibliometric Bibliometric analysis, a search of all the articles containing the keywords “medical device” AND “usability” AND “safety” was conducted in both Web of Science and Google Scholar (through Harzing Harzing ’s Publish or Perish). The results that also contained the metadata were exported to VOS Viewer for cluster generation and co-citation Co-citations analyses. Following this, a core set of articles, some of which demonstrated strong ties within the topic at hand, were chosen from various databases and co-citation Co-citations analysis. The core set also included a relevant chapter from the Handbook of Human Factors and Ergonomics Ergonomics , Fourth Edition by Salvendy. The articles were added to Mendeley and then exported to MAXQDA Maxqda for the word-cloud generation. As part of the lexical Lexical search, Springer’s AuthorMapper and Digital Science’s Dimensions was used to extract trending keywords, author information and metadata of relevant contributions made to the topic by institutions worldwide. Overall, the main keywords of human cognition Cognition , health informatics, precision medicine, applied ergonomics Ergonomics and design safety showed high relevance within all the chosen articles. These keywords are highly reflective of the fields that are currently disrupting the conventional governance of healthcare Healthcare .',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Current computer video-based vibration modal analysis approaches typically decompose video frames into representations and then adjust them that allow to magnify motions to extract motion representations for vibration modal analysis. Their decomposition usually relies upon handcrafted designed kernels, such as the complex steerable kernels, which typically may not be optimally designed for the extraction of subtle motions specially in higher frequency domains. In this paper, optimal decomposition kernel is learned and designed directly from baseline dataset images using deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Each subpixel of an image obtained from a digital camera is included when computing the spatiotemporal information, which serves similar to an individual motion sensor to acquire the modal frequencies of a vibrating structure. A hybrid-attention-LSTM-based deep convolutional neural network architecture is developed to take advantage of attention and LSTM blocks to discover subtle motions from a specific source to visualize high resolution of dynamic properties of the structures in the existence of high amounts of noise. The idea of transfer learning is utilized to transfer the knowledge previously learned to new limited dataset. Transfer learning is used to take advantage of limited existing dataset to avoid underfitting in the training of the network, considering the current publicly available modal frequency datasets are insufficient to train a generalized network. The proposed deep learning architecture is designed in such a way that has capability of transferring the trained model from baseline dataset on a simple structure to a complicated structure using transfer learning perspective. After training, the model takes the video of a vibrating structure as input and outputs the fundamental modal frequencies. By showing reliable empirical results, the proposed model is autonomous, efficient, and accurate.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Prior to mechanical refrigeration systems, people harvested natural ice and used cellars to cool and preserve the perishables, especially food. There were other preservation methods available: salting, pickling, drying, spicing, and smoking. However, most of the fresh foods and other temperature-sensitive goods were available only in the local market due to their short shelf life and perishability. With the advancement of cooling technology, temperature-controlled supply chain or cold chain is developed; therefore, the fresh food today can be stored longer and transported to different markets across the borders of the countries. Refrigeration technologies play vital role to preserve and transport perishable food from the point of production to the point of consumption. In the past, a cold chain simply denoted single temperature warehouses and refrigerated vehicles. There was no awareness of integrating the supply chain links and, as a result, billions of dollars’ worth of losses occurred every year. To achieve basic understanding on the cold chain, food and vaccines cold chains are explained and socioeconomic and environmental impacts, and the research trends of cold chain are presented.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Caffeine is widely consumed by adults and children worldwide. There is little theoretical or empirical evidence that explains how caffeine consumption may influence aggressive behavior. We review research investigating the relationship between caffeine and aggression in both human and non-human animals across the lifespan. Based on this review, there is no clear consensus. The strongest evidence comes from studies investigating the co-consumption of caffeine and alcohol in adolescents and adults. Those who co-ingest caffeine and alcohol are more likely to be perpetrators or victims of aggression. Among adolescents, findings appear to converge that caffeine intake via energy drinks is related to increased aggression, including both perpetration and victimization. Theoretical advances and stronger experimental evidence are required to clarify the role of caffeine in aggression. However, existing evidence suggests no cause for alarm when caffeine is consumed on its own.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Gender-affirming treatment for transgender people is characterized by a multidisciplinary approach in which the endocrinologist plays a crucial role. Endocrinologists should explore the desired body changes of each person in order to guarantee a real personalized clinical approach. Most current guidelines include hormonal treatment protocols only for binary transgender people, requesting full virilization or full femininization and de-virilization. However, requests for an individualized treatment in non-binary transgender people are increasing. In this chapter, we review hormonal treatment strategies for binary and non-binary transgender people, describing available compounds, expected body modifications, and safety profile. Although literature in this field has been increasing over the last years, future studies should address long-term outcomes of hormonal treatment and the effects of personalized treatment in non-binary transgender people.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Omega-3 and omega-6 groups of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are non-interconvertible and metabolically and functionally different, with key opposing metabolic activities in human physiology. The PUFA content of the cell membrane is mostly determined by dietary intake. They are a component of the cellular membrane, improving its fluidity and PUFAs must be released from the membrane by phospholipases in order for signal transmission to occur. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids exert their anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting lipogenesis and increasing the production of resolvins and protectins. n-3 PUFAs mediate some of these effects by antagonizing n-6 PUFA-induced proinflammatory prostaglandin E formation. Today’s industrialized societies with Westernized diet styles have higher overall energy intake, and n-6 PUFAs, but lower energy expenditure. Omega-3 PUFA attenuates ER stress and increases mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation and mitochondrial uncoupling. There is competition between omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 for desaturation enzymes. The unbalanced omega 6/omega 3 ratio in favor of omega 6 PUFAs contributes to the prevalence of atherosclerosis, obesity, and diabetes. n-3 PUFAs are considered to be more protective against inflammation compared with omega 6 PUFA, suggesting the importance of maintaining an ideal balance.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Following the political and philosophical debates explored in Chap. 1 , six ontological features of the human condition are identified, described and explored in this chapter, and which are central to The Ontology of Well-Being Thesis (TOWT) defended here and throughout the book. The features are, in no prioritised order, human embodiment , finiteness , sociability , cognition , evaluation , and agency . The main argument is that these features need articulating in any plausible epistemological account of well-being, concerning what we know about this phenomenon, focussing on how we establish what, in and of itself, helps a life go better. And concerning how well-being is understood normatively, and so is promoted as a social value, notably in social policy and welfare practice. The principal assumption is therefore existentialist in character – that is, well-being, while is promotable as a substantive social ideal to be enhanced for future populations, must first reflect the existential and ontological features of what and who human beings are presently, with these features reflected across a gamut of human experiences. A further claim of TOWT is that these ontological features interrelate in complex ways, producing various conflicts in the epistemology and normativity of human well-being, and how it is understood and practically applied. Significantly, conflicting experiences of time, emotion, and self-consciousness are revealed, which, it is argued, must be accommodated for in any comprehensive epistemological and normative account of human well-being, which then can be usefully applied to a range of social policies and welfare practices.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Several studies have pointed out that Human factors are one of the main significant challenges in the development of the Factory of the Future (FoF). We speak now of Industry 5.0: industry 4.0 with the emphasis of ecology and human aspects. In this context the aim of this paper is to present the new issues for worker’s health and safety which have to be taken into account as soon as possible in the workplace design process and its use. We are speaking of “integrated prevention” which has to be applied from the system requirements to the functional design and the architectural design. Deployment of new technologies and organizations in the frame of FoF introduces hazardous events, problems of health and safety which have to be taken into account in the different life situations. The identification of dangerous situations therefore requires investigation of identification of characteristic design parameters related to risk qualification for the operator tasks. We start from the basic idea that accident is the interaction between a dangerous device and the worker, that can be directly linked to the generalized energy in a defined space. Each energy is characterized by parameters related to hazards for which the severity is defined by the standards and regulations. The methodology proposed combines a generic design approach based on a systems engineering approach to identify the uses that operators will make to ensure production requirements, and an energy approach for identifying potential hazards.',\n",

First, we examine the cumulative growth of the positive psychology and psychology of religion/spirituality (R/S) fields, including their degree of existing overlap and their typical publication outlets. Next, we discuss why enhanced integration of these fields would be mutually beneficial and would potentiate their coevolution toward greater scientific and societal impact. Then we acknowledge potential barriers to the integration of these fields and offer recommendations for transcending those barriers. Finally, we preview the organization of this handbook and make suggestions to guide reading it.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'World is battling with COVID-19 Pandemic, it has infected 236\\xa0million and taken over 4.83\\xa0million lives globally. In India alone, 33.89\\xa0million are infected and caused over 4.49 Lakh of fatalities. In Jammu and Kashmir, 3.3 Lakh are infected and caused over 4.4 thousand deaths. Researchers are trying their best to come up with solutions that can combat COVID-19. It is slated that the world has to battle with it and to follow SOP’s until and unless an effective vaccine will be developed. On the technological side, IoT is a new and promising area to combat with the COVID-19 Pandemic. Nowadays, smartphones and wearables have various onboard sensors like temperature sensor, proximity sensor, an audio sensor, camera, inertial sensor, color sensor, etc. that can be used in getting the data of a person. The temperature sensor reading can tell us the temperature of a person. Based on that reading, a person can be sent for further clinical tests at an initial level. IoT technology can accurately manage patient information, and can be effective in proactive diagnosis with reduced cost. The IoT technology, a set of well-organized components, can work together as a part of an system to fight against and will lower the spread of the COVID-19 Virus. IoT has gained considerable attention from almost every field, such as industries and especially from healthcare. IoT technology is reshaping the traditional healthcare system by incorporating technology into it. In this article, a IoT layered architecture have been proposed with three different layers. The detailed working of all three layers is explained. A novel IoTFEC-19 framework has been proposed to detect COVID-19 suspects early with sensors and wearable devices. The Framework consists of three layers: Sensing Layer or Data Collection Layer, Data Analytics Layer, and Prediction Layer. In Sensing Layer, different sensors are used to collect the data and send it for analysis. In Analysis Layer, the level of symptoms is calculated from the data received from the Sensing Layer. The third layer is the Prediction Layer, in which prediction is made from the computed values in Analysis Layer, whether the suspected may be COVID-19 positive or negative. The last layer is the cloud layer used for storage services and data used for further analysis. The proposed IoTFEC framework aims to detect the COVID-19 suspected early, provide early treatment, and stop further spreading.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Mental illnesses are often undiagnosed, highlighting the need for an effective alternative to traditional screening surveys. We propose our Early Mental Health Uncovering (EMU) framework that conducts rapid mental illness screening with active and passive modalities. We designed, deployed, and evaluated the EMU app to passively collect retrospective digital phenotype data and actively collect short voice recordings. The EMU app also administered a depression screening survey to label the data. We collected data from crowdsourced and student populations, both of whom shared sufficient voice recordings for modeling. We thus assess the classification ability of machine learning and deep learning models trained with scripted and unscripted voice recordings. For the crowdsourced participants, machine learning models screened for depression with an AUC of 0.78 and suicidal ideation with an AUC of 0.73. For the student participants, deep learning models screened for depression with an AUC of 0.70 and suicidal ideation with an AUC of 0.72. Combining datasets did not improve screening capabilities, though the best performing models on the combined dataset notably required voice transcripts. This research facilitates a better understanding of modality selection for mobile screening. We will make the features publicly available to further advance mental illness screening research.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'There is an increasing need for the development of novel self-powered, inexpensive, and flexible pressure sensors with the potential for structural health monitoring (SHM) applications. The mechanoluminescence (ML)-perovskite pressure sensor is a promising integrated device that integrates the light-emitting principles of mechanoluminescence and the light-absorbing properties of perovskite materials. Long-term stability is crucial for continuous in-situ SHM using embedded sensors. This study reported a high-stable all-inorganic carbon-based perovskite photodetector integrated with an ML layer of ZnS:Cu. Interface engineering was employed in the modification of the electron transport layer (ETL) by the addition of a MgI 2 layer. Compared with devices without modification, devices based on the modified ETL showed an increase in response time and overall performance. Further studies showed improved sensor performance for impact events when embedded in a carbon fiber composite structure. The results show that the sensor exhibits distinct signals when subjected to different load conditions and can be used for the in-situ SHM of advanced composite structures with promising long-term stability.',\n",

This review is intended to critically summarize the circuit, cellular, and molecular mechanisms by which sleep influences reward function, and to reveal critical challenges for future studies.

       "  'abstract': 'Damage detection algorithms employing the traditional acceleration measurements and the associated modal features may underperform due to the limited number of sensors used in the monitoring and the smoothing effect of spline functions used to increase the spatial resolution. This study presents a hybrid structural health monitoring method for vibration-based damage detection of bridge-type structures to overcome such problems. The proposed method is based on sensor fusion from conventional and computer vision-based acceleration measurements. Three commonly used damage measures are presented and employed: mode shape curvature method, modal strain energy method, and modal flexibility method. The accuracy of these algorithms with the conventional structural health monitoring approach is demonstrated in a numerical case study, where damage scenarios are simulated on a simply-supported bridge. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed hybrid health monitoring methodology are demonstrated in a case study where the conventional acceleration measurements fail to detect and locate the damage. The outcomes of this study indicate a strong potential of the proposed method for damage detection.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Damage is defined as any change to the material, geometry or boundary condition that can modify the structure’s properties or response. In the past, damage identification was performed through periodical inspection, non-destructive testing/non-destructive evaluation, or visual observation. Structural health monitoring (SHM) has emerged to transition from offline damage identification to near real-time and online damage assessment. Hence, SHM is a damage detection strategy to monitor a structure for a period using a series of continuous measurement devices, which then collect the system’s characteristics and subsequently perform statistical analysis to assess the current circumstances and health of the structure. One of the first steps for the study of SHM is damage detection followed by monitoring. Machine Learning (ML) techniques can be used to develop viable algorithms to make potential predictions. ML algorithms are therefore providing the tools needed to enhance the capabilities of SHM systems and provide intelligent solutions to past challenges. Preliminary studies have reviewed that the extension of ML into SHM has dramatically increased the system’s capabilities, providing innovative solutions to different research challenges. This work conducts a study of the use of ML to identify damage in a beam and discuss the challenge of usage, performance and implementation of each technique.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The worldwide increase in population, rapid industrialization, and enormous use of plastic products in household appliances and in industrial sector lead to plastic pollution in environment. Plastic products release different types of additive materials in environment during decomposition process. Recent studies show that leaching of additives from plastic products is great matter of concern as they are persistent, bioaccumulative in nature, and highly toxic to biota. Among these added materials, flame retardants (FRs) possess critical virulent effects on aquatic life and human beings. FRs are synthetic chemicals widely used in consumer products to increase their ignition resistance property. Different types of FRs are utilized in plastic industry such as organohalogen, organophosphate, metal (aluminum)-, and nitrogen-containing FRs. The organohalogen FRs now a days are the most preferably used FRs because of low coast, competence, and good performance. Among organohalogen, brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are widely used in consumer products. Several traditional BFRs (e.g., polybrominated diphenyl ether [PBDE]) have been included in the list of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and their utilization is restricted due to their known toxicity and persistence nature. Over the past few years, these compounds have been replaced with “new” BFRs (NBFRs). In spite of the fact that chemical structure of NBFRs and traditional BFRs are different but they share most of the physical-chemical properties (substitution of halogen atom and solubility in fat) which are similar to both groups; therefore, their outcome in environment is possibly similar to the restricted BFRs. Due to their potential toxicity to humans and organisms, as well as persistent and bioaccumulative nature, their complete removal (including real-time analysis, rules, and regulations) or transformation into another useful product is highly crucial. In this way, traditional techniques such as photocatalysis, thermal degradation, adsorption, and anaerobic degradation were employed. Recently, nanomaterials (including metal, metal oxide, and nanocomposites) with small size and high surface area emerge as the most economic, rapid, and effective photocatalysts under artificial and sunlight irradiation, also used for debromination of BFRs by using different mechanisms. The current chapter brings out readers with broad information on problem related with traditional BFRs and NBFRs (classification, consumption, environmental concentration, and need for different degradation techniques) and their removal using nanoparticles (NPs) through adsorption, photocatalysis, reductive, and oxidative debromination. Furthermore, significance of green synthesized NPs in the degradation of BFRs has future scope.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'German federalism has represented both an obstacle and an opportunity for the handling of the Coronavirus pandemic. Initially, the state governments competed against each other over the “right” way to handle the situation. The different strategies adopted by the states informed the federal government’s policy decisions, which resulted in the first nationwide lockdown. Subsequently, the state governments began to compete against one another again and challenged the federal government over the most appropriate policy approaches after the lockdown period. The political constellation resulted in a system in which the federal government and the state governments agreed to coordinate policymaking.

       "  'abstract': 'COVID-19 has hit citizens dramatically during 2020, not only creating a general risk-driven environment encompassing a wide array of economic vulnerabilities but also exposing them to pervasive digital risks, such as biosurveillance, misinformation, and e-democracy algorithmic threats. Over the course of the pandemic, a debate has emerged about the appropriate democratic and technopolitical response when governments use disease surveillance technologies to tackle the spread of COVID-19, pointing out the dichotomy between state-Leviathan cybercontrol and civil liberties. The COVID-19 pandemic has inevitably raised the need to resiliently and technopolitically respond to democratic threats that hyperconnected and highly virialised societies produce. In order to shed light on this debate, amidst this volume on “democratic deepening”, this chapter introduces the new term “postpandemic technopolitical democracy” as a way to figure out emerging forms and scales for developing democracy and citizen participation in hyperconnected and highly virialised postpandemic societies. Insofar as the digital layer cannot be detached from the current democratic challenges of the twenty-first century including neoliberalism, scales, civic engagement, and action research-driven co-production methodologies; this chapter suggests a democratic toolbox encompassing four intertwined factors including (i) the context characterised by the algorithmic nations, (ii) challenges stemming from data sovereignty, (iii) mobilisation seen from the digital rights perspective, and (iv) grassroots innovation embodied through data cooperatives. This chapter elucidates that in the absence of coordinated and interdependent strategies to claim digital rights and data sovereignty by algorithmic nations, on the one hand, big tech data-opolies and, on the other hand, the GDPR led by the European Commission might bound (negatively) and expand (positively) respectively, algorithmic nations’ capacity to mitigate the negative side effects of the algorithmic disruption in Western democracies.',\n",

Presenting a background to forced migration internationally it describes the humanitarian refugee programme, and the challenges facing asylum seekers claiming protection. For the latter group the evidence is of human rights abuses and a failure to deliver socially just outcomes, particularly for people in immigration detention. Social workers engage with diverse communities including those who have been formally approved as refugees, or lived in detention, and who may continue to live on temporary protection visas. This presents tensions between meeting the aims of the ethical codes of practice and the reality facing their clients of having limited access to resources and social justice. It presents the lived experience of two prominent refugees who have written about their experiences of unsuccessful claims for protection in Australia. The chapter addresses how, in the face of silencing refugee and asylum seeker voices, critical social work can identify sites of resistance, hope and compassion.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Aims/hypotheses Smoking and use of smokeless tobacco (snus) are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. We investigated whether smoking and snus use increase the risk of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and elucidated potential interaction with HLA high-risk genotypes. Methods Analyses were based on Swedish case–control data (collected 2010–2019) with incident cases of LADA ( n =593) and type 2 diabetes ( n =2038), and 3036 controls, and Norwegian prospective data (collected 1984–2019) with incident cases of LADA ( n =245) and type 2 diabetes ( n =3726) during 1,696,503 person-years of follow-up. Pooled RRs with 95% CIs were estimated for smoking, and ORs for snus use (case–control data only). The interaction was assessed by attributable proportion (AP) due to interaction. A two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) study on smoking and LADA/type 2 diabetes was conducted based on summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. Results Smoking (RR pooled 1.30 [95% CI 1.06, 1.59] for current vs never) and snus use (OR 1.97 [95% CI 1.20, 3.24] for ≥15 box-years vs never use) were associated with an increased risk of LADA. Corresponding estimates for type 2 diabetes were 1.38 (95% CI 1.28, 1.49) and 1.92 (95% CI 1.27, 2.90), respectively. There was interaction between smoking and HLA high-risk genotypes (AP 0.27 [95% CI 0.01, 0.53]) in relation to LADA. The positive association between smoking and LADA/type 2 diabetes was confirmed by the MR study. Conclusions/interpretation Our findings suggest that tobacco use increases the risk of LADA and that smoking acts synergistically with genetic susceptibility in the promotion of LADA.

       "  'abstract': \"The notes that doctors take of the patients who visit them have a very important value to follow-up on the medical evolution. Thus, an adequate analysis of them allows preventive action to be taken so that diseases or pathologies do not worsen and can be treated properly. In the field of nutrition, medical notes play a critical role since they allow monitoring the progress of the patient's physiological constants, and obtaining information on aspects such as the good behavior of nutrients in the pathologies presented by patients. In order to manage this information, an application is required that is capable of storing the information and allowing efficient access to it. This article describes a web application designed to manage all the information that a nutritionist needs to store about their patients as well as other useful tools for information analysis such as visual representations of information, statistical calculations, or report generation. In particular, it allows the management of anthropometric measurements.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Internet of Things (IoT) is an important emerging technology that enables (usually) pervasive ubiquitous devices to connect to the Internet. Medical and Healthcare Internet of Things (MHIoT) represents one of the application areas for IoT that has revolutionized the healthcare sector. In this study, a systematized literature review on the adoption of MHIoT for diabetes management is done to investigate the application of IoT in the monitoring of diabetes, key challenges, what has been done, in which context, and the research gap using Denyer and Transfield’s systematic literature review methodology. The key findings reveal that developing nations are lagging despite the greater benefits of MHIoT in such resource-constrained contexts. The findings suggest that infrastructure costs, security, and privacy issues are most important in the adoption of MHIoT for diabetes management. The opportunities presented by MHIoT surpass the challenges as healthcare costs are reduced in a resource-constrained context. Further research in infrastructural needs and privacy concerns is needed to take full advantage of these benefits and address the challenges.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The right to gender identity starts from the need to recognize to individuals a right to self-determination that is considered, in the private and family field, absolute and insusceptible of conditions and limits to its exercise, in the sense that it pertains to that field of freedom that the legal system must protect from aggression, and that it itself cannot attack. Law no. 164 of 14 April 1982 lays down rules on the rectification of the attribution of sex, for a complete regulation of the procedural aspects of the relevant procedure. According to Court of Cassation 20 July 2015 no. 15138, the desire to realize a coincidence between soma and psyche is the result of an elaboration of one’s gender identity, realized with the support of necessary medical and psychological treatments and the path of adaptation is a process of self-determination . In light of constitutional jurisprudence, the rectification of the personal data of the attribution of sex is possible, only on the medico-legal confirmation of the so-called gender dysphoria, even, that is, in the absence of a preventive surgical intervention to adapt the primary sexual characteristics to the “psychic sex.” It is left to the free and unquestionable will of the individual, the decision whether or not to precede the request for rectification of the registry from the submission to the surgical reassignment of the sex.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Technological advances in the construction of wind turbines with lower noise emission have been many, however they continue to be responsible for producing infrasound and low frequency noise that can affect the quality of life of human populations (hypertension, discomfort, sleep disorders, among others). Assess the levels of infrasound and low-frequency noise at which residents in the vicinity of the wind turbines were taking into account wind direction, air speed and distance to the source. The analytical collection was carried out inside houses in the district of Viana do Castelo, using a CESVA SC420 sound level meter. The distance to the noise source was not a relevant factor in the attenuation. The wind speed and direction were responsible for the noise expression. The southernmost dwellings in the region under study were more exposed to higher levels of this types of noise. It is important to adopt territorial management measures taking into account the protection of public health, environmental impact studies within the scope of the types of noise and safety distances, taking into account the population.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic social media networks emerged as pivotal means of communication and updates about the pandemic. As the pandemic continued to claim lives, an ample amount of unchecked information was circulating online about the disease, this resulted in citizens facing a wave of fake news not only in Jordan but across the world. This has led governments and health institutions to echo their concerns about the serious threat fake news can cause to citizens’ lives. This research study uses a quantitative content analysis to report on the sources and types of fake news spread in Jordan between the period of April 2020 until April 2021 using a data collected by a Jordanian fact checking news website named AKEED. This study is of a vital importance given the scale of concerns resonated by the World Health Organization about facing tsunami of misinformation termed as infodemic. This also comes in a time that is described as “post truth” era. This study concludes that both infodemic and post truth eras hold true in the case of fake news disseminated in Jordan. The study also found that many of these stories are originated from inside of Jordan and that social media networks were the dominant place for these false stories to spread and reach to audiences. The study reveled that fake news stories related to health were the highest number of stories spread in Jordan with the period of this study. Also, the highest percentage of fake news were classified as inaccurate stories with a percentage of 48.40% followed by an intentionally fabricated stories with a percentage of 24.52%.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Romania’s reaction to COVID-19 was characterized by sharp contrasts between the initial measures and subsequent developments. The country reacted swiftly in March 2020 and launched a State of Emergency to curb the virus spread. Called for the first time since the regime change in 1989, this procedure limits citizens’ constitutional rights. The country was among the first EU Member States to close schools and borders, ban public events, suspend the activity of restaurants and non-essential shops and impose movement restrictions on the population. However, one year and a half later the country had many deaths and high rate of infections. Similarly, the vaccination campaign started very well in January 2021, with clear planning, but in less than one year the country was second last in the EU in terms of vaccinated share of population. These apparent paradoxes are explained through the disempowerment of experts, inconsistent actions and limited predictability of policies in Romania throughout the pandemic.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Vision Zero requires a new approach to the responsibility for safety. This chapter provides conceptual tools for the description and analysis of this and other responsibility issues. Distinctions between different types of responsibility are introduced, with a particular emphasis on the distinction between blame responsibility and task responsibility. The complex relationship between responsibility and causality is also delineated. This is followed by an analysis of the changes in responsibility assignments that are necessary to implement Visio Zero.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Analysing the response of the Finnish government to the COVID-19 crisis, this chapter shows that patterns of governance combined elements of centralized leadership, ministerial dominance, and scientific expertise. Decision-making was centered around the Prime Minister’s Office and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, and horizontal coordination created challenges. The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare was highly visible throughout the crisis, but occasionally the views of the health authorities and the government differed. After an initial seemingly passive phase, the government in mid-March 2020 declared a state of emergency and imposed strict anti-pandemic measures. The first wave of the pandemic was characterized by a sense of national urgency both in terms of policies and public opinion. Subsequently the government shifted to a decentralized, hybrid strategy under normal legislation, with targeted regional solutions favoured more instead of nation-wide measures. This produced occasional tensions between subnational authorities and the national executive while the confusing terminology of the authorities contributed to the increasing criticism of the government. However, overall, there was very little contestation of the adopted measures.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The evolution of technology in twenty-first century particularly in the era of industrial 4.0 had brought an artificial intelligence (AI) and its subset machine learning (ML) into the real-world applications. This study was conducted to present a short review on the artificial intelligence approach for occupational health and safety applications focusing in an industrial ventilation. The searches were performed over 3 available electronics data bases including ScienceDirect, SCOPUS and Sprinker-Link. There were 503 articles found in total; combined with 18 articles, relevant to the topic, sought and selected from the search engines. Only 7 were considered meeting with the inclusion criteria. The study showed that there were three major categories, if considering base on types of dataset and data acquisition, which consisted of computer vision, various sensors and the historical dataset. Each category was unique to its own implementation depending on difference in an individual feature of interests. The ML application showed efficient performance and looming for the bright prospects in the present and near future.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Cybersecurity is the discipline of defending systems, networks, and programs against digital assaults intended to gain access to, alter, or delete sensitive data, or disrupt regular business activities. With the transformation of digitalization, information on the internet becomes vulnerable to cyber attacks, and healthcare organizations have a critical importance in this regard. Digital healthcare technology is widely used across the world, and the security of healthcare data and equipment is a growing problem since medical equipment has been exposed to new cybersecurity risks as its access to current computer networks has increased. However, the cybersecurity frameworks offered provide a generic framework for all organizations, and prioritizing the categories within the framework for the healthcare organization is critical in terms of developing an effective security policy. In this study, an internationally accepted cybersecurity framework is evaluated by health experts, and the framework is prioritized for the use by healthcare organizations. Since such a task is carried out on linguistic expressions and experts may be uncertain about some of the categories, there is a need for a model that both converts linguistic expressions into numerical measurable form while comprehensively addressing the vagueness. For this purpose, a novel interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method has been developed for ranking the categories within each domain of the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework for the use of healthcare organizations. A sensitivity analysis, theoretical and practical consequences, and future research recommendations are also provided within the study.',\n",
