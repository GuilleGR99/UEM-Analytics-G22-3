How Does NLP Benefit Legal System: A Summary of Legal Artificial Intelligence,"  Legal Artificial Intelligence (LegalAI) focuses on applying the technology of
artificial intelligence, especially natural language processing, to benefit
tasks in the legal domain. In recent years, LegalAI has drawn increasing
attention rapidly from both AI researchers and legal professionals, as LegalAI
is beneficial to the legal system for liberating legal professionals from a
maze of paperwork. Legal professionals often think about how to solve tasks
from rule-based and symbol-based methods, while NLP researchers concentrate
more on data-driven and embedding methods. In this paper, we introduce the
history, the current state, and the future directions of research in LegalAI.
We illustrate the tasks from the perspectives of legal professionals and NLP
researchers and show several representative applications in LegalAI. We conduct
experiments and provide an in-depth analysis of the advantages and
disadvantages of existing works to explore possible future directions. You can

Applications of Artificial Intelligence Techniques to Combating Cyber Crimes: A Review,"  With the advances in information technology (IT) criminals are using
cyberspace to commit numerous cyber crimes. Cyber infrastructures are highly
vulnerable to intrusions and other threats. Physical devices and human
intervention are not sufficient for monitoring and protection of these
infrastructures; hence, there is a need for more sophisticated cyber defense
systems that need to be flexible, adaptable and robust, and able to detect a
wide variety of threats and make intelligent real-time decisions. Numerous
bio-inspired computing methods of Artificial Intelligence have been
increasingly playing an important role in cyber crime detection and prevention.
The purpose of this study is to present advances made so far in the field of
applying AI techniques for combating cyber crimes, to demonstrate how these
techniques can be an effective tool for detection and prevention of cyber
attacks, as well as to give the scope for future work.

Artificial Intelligence and its Role in Near Future,"  AI technology has a long history which is actively and constantly changing
and growing. It focuses on intelligent agents, which contain devices that
perceive the environment and based on which takes actions in order to maximize
goal success chances. In this paper, we will explain the modern AI basics and
various representative applications of AI. In the context of the modern
digitalized world, AI is the property of machines, computer programs, and
systems to perform the intellectual and creative functions of a person,
independently find ways to solve problems, be able to draw conclusions and make
decisions. Most artificial intelligence systems have the ability to learn,
which allows people to improve their performance over time. The recent research
on AI tools, including machine learning, deep learning and predictive analysis
intended toward increasing the planning, learning, reasoning, thinking and
action taking ability. Based on which, the proposed research intends towards
exploring on how the human intelligence differs from the artificial
intelligence. Moreover, we critically analyze what AI of today is capable of
doing, why it still cannot reach human intelligence and what are the open
challenges existing in front of AI to reach and outperform human level of
intelligence. Furthermore, it will explore the future predictions for
artificial intelligence and based on which potential solution will be
recommended to solve it within next decades.

The Challenge of Non-Technical Loss Detection using Artificial Intelligence: A Survey,"  Detection of non-technical losses (NTL) which include electricity theft,
faulty meters or billing errors has attracted increasing attention from
researchers in electrical engineering and computer science. NTLs cause
significant harm to the economy, as in some countries they may range up to 40%
of the total electricity distributed. The predominant research direction is
employing artificial intelligence to predict whether a customer causes NTL.
This paper first provides an overview of how NTLs are defined and their impact
on economies, which include loss of revenue and profit of electricity providers
and decrease of the stability and reliability of electrical power grids. It
then surveys the state-of-the-art research efforts in a up-to-date and
comprehensive review of algorithms, features and data sets used. It finally
identifies the key scientific and engineering challenges in NTL detection and
suggests how they could be addressed in the future.

Building Ethics into Artificial Intelligence,"  As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly ubiquitous, the
topic of AI governance for ethical decision-making by AI has captured public
imagination. Within the AI research community, this topic remains less familiar
to many researchers. In this paper, we complement existing surveys, which
largely focused on the psychological, social and legal discussions of the
topic, with an analysis of recent advances in technical solutions for AI
governance. By reviewing publications in leading AI conferences including AAAI,
AAMAS, ECAI and IJCAI, we propose a taxonomy which divides the field into four
areas: 1) exploring ethical dilemmas; 2) individual ethical decision
frameworks; 3) collective ethical decision frameworks; and 4) ethics in
human-AI interactions. We highlight the intuitions and key techniques used in
each approach, and discuss promising future research directions towards
successful integration of ethical AI systems into human societies.

Linking Artificial Intelligence Principles,"  Artificial Intelligence principles define social and ethical considerations
to develop future AI. They come from research institutes, government
organizations and industries. All versions of AI principles are with different
considerations covering different perspectives and making different emphasis.
None of them can be considered as complete and can cover the rest AI principle
proposals. Here we introduce LAIP, an effort and platform for linking and
analyzing different Artificial Intelligence Principles. We want to explicitly
establish the common topics and links among AI Principles proposed by different
organizations and investigate on their uniqueness. Based on these efforts, for
the long-term future of AI, instead of directly adopting any of the AI
principles, we argue for the necessity of incorporating various AI Principles
into a comprehensive framework and focusing on how they can interact and
complete each other.

"AI-GAs: AI-generating algorithms, an alternate paradigm for producing general artificial intelligence","  Perhaps the most ambitious scientific quest in human history is the creation
of general artificial intelligence, which roughly means AI that is as smart or
smarter than humans. The dominant approach in the machine learning community is
to attempt to discover each of the pieces required for intelligence, with the
implicit assumption that some future group will complete the Herculean task of
figuring out how to combine all of those pieces into a complex thinking
machine. I call this the ""manual AI approach"". This paper describes another
exciting path that ultimately may be more successful at producing general AI.
It is based on the clear trend in machine learning that hand-designed solutions
eventually are replaced by more effective, learned solutions. The idea is to
create an AI-generating algorithm (AI-GA), which automatically learns how to
produce general AI. Three Pillars are essential for the approach: (1)
meta-learning architectures, (2) meta-learning the learning algorithms
themselves, and (3) generating effective learning environments. I argue that
either approach could produce general AI first, and both are scientifically
worthwhile irrespective of which is the fastest path. Because both are
promising, yet the ML community is currently committed to the manual approach,
I argue that our community should increase its research investment in the AI-GA
approach. To encourage such research, I describe promising work in each of the
Three Pillars. I also discuss AI-GA-specific safety and ethical considerations.
Because it it may be the fastest path to general AI and because it is
inherently scientifically interesting to understand the conditions in which a
simple algorithm can produce general AI (as happened on Earth where Darwinian
evolution produced human intelligence), I argue that the pursuit of AI-GAs
should be considered a new grand challenge of computer science research.

Artificial Intelligence Safety and Cybersecurity: a Timeline of AI Failures,"  In this work, we present and analyze reported failures of artificially
intelligent systems and extrapolate our analysis to future AIs. We suggest that
both the frequency and the seriousness of future AI failures will steadily
increase. AI Safety can be improved based on ideas developed by cybersecurity
experts. For narrow AIs safety failures are at the same, moderate, level of
criticality as in cybersecurity, however for general AI, failures have a
fundamentally different impact. A single failure of a superintelligent system
may cause a catastrophic event without a chance for recovery. The goal of
cybersecurity is to reduce the number of successful attacks on the system; the
goal of AI Safety is to make sure zero attacks succeed in bypassing the safety
mechanisms. Unfortunately, such a level of performance is unachievable. Every
security system will eventually fail; there is no such thing as a 100% secure
system.

A comparative study of artificial intelligence and human doctors for the purpose of triage and diagnosis,"  Online symptom checkers have significant potential to improve patient care,
however their reliability and accuracy remain variable. We hypothesised that an
artificial intelligence (AI) powered triage and diagnostic system would compare
favourably with human doctors with respect to triage and diagnostic accuracy.
We performed a prospective validation study of the accuracy and safety of an AI
powered triage and diagnostic system. Identical cases were evaluated by both an
AI system and human doctors. Differential diagnoses and triage outcomes were
evaluated by an independent judge, who was blinded from knowing the source (AI
system or human doctor) of the outcomes. Independently of these cases,
vignettes from publicly available resources were also assessed to provide a
benchmark to previous studies and the diagnostic component of the MRCGP exam.
Overall we found that the Babylon AI powered Triage and Diagnostic System was
able to identify the condition modelled by a clinical vignette with accuracy
comparable to human doctors (in terms of precision and recall). In addition, we
found that the triage advice recommended by the AI System was, on average,
safer than that of human doctors, when compared to the ranges of acceptable
triage provided by independent expert judges, with only a minimal reduction in
appropriateness.

"CERTIFAI: Counterfactual Explanations for Robustness, Transparency, Interpretability, and Fairness of Artificial Intelligence models","  As artificial intelligence plays an increasingly important role in our
society, there are ethical and moral obligations for both businesses and
researchers to ensure that their machine learning models are designed,
deployed, and maintained responsibly. These models need to be rigorously
audited for fairness, robustness, transparency, and interpretability. A variety
of methods have been developed that focus on these issues in isolation,
however, managing these methods in conjunction with model development can be
cumbersome and timeconsuming. In this paper, we introduce a unified and
model-agnostic approach to address these issues: Counterfactual Explanations
for Robustness, Transparency, Interpretability, and Fairness of Artificial
Intelligence models (CERTIFAI). Unlike previous methods in this domain,
CERTIFAI is a general tool that can be applied to any black-box model and any
type of input data. Given a model and an input instance, CERTIFAI uses a custom
genetic algorithm to generate counterfactuals: instances close to the input
that change the prediction of the model. We demonstrate how these
counterfactuals can be used to examine issues of robustness, interpretability,
transparency, and fairness. Additionally, we introduce CERScore, the first
black-box model robustness score that performs comparably to methods that have
access to model internals.

employed in agriculture over a long period of time, alongside other advanced
computing technologies. However, increased attention is currently being paid to
the use of such smart technologies. Agriculture has provided an important
source of food for human beings over many thousands of years, including the
development of appropriate farming methods for different types of crops. The
emergence of new advanced IoT technologies has the potential to monitor the
agricultural environment to ensure high-quality products. However, there
remains a lack of research and development in relation to Smart Sustainable
Agriculture (SSA), accompanied by complex obstacles arising from the
fragmentation of agricultural processes, i.e. the control and operation of
IoT/AI machines; data sharing and management; interoperability; and large
amounts of data analysis and storage. This study firstly, explores existing

architecture capable of underpinning the development of SSA platforms. As well
as contributing to the current body of knowledge, this research reviews

A Grounded Interaction Protocol for Explainable Artificial Intelligence,"  Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) systems need to include an
explanation model to communicate the internal decisions, behaviours and actions
to the interacting humans. Successful explanation involves both cognitive and
social processes. In this paper we focus on the challenge of meaningful
interaction between an explainer and an explainee and investigate the
structural aspects of an interactive explanation to propose an interaction
protocol. We follow a bottom-up approach to derive the model by analysing
transcripts of different explanation dialogue types with 398 explanation
dialogues. We use grounded theory to code and identify key components of an
explanation dialogue. We formalize the model using the agent dialogue framework
(ADF) as a new dialogue type and then evaluate it in a human-agent interaction
study with 101 dialogues from 14 participants. Our results show that the
proposed model can closely follow the explanation dialogues of human-agent
conversations.

Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence,"  It is undeniable that artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain concepts
are spreading at a phenomenal rate. Both technologies have distinct degree of
technological complexity and multi-dimensional business implications. However,
a common misunderstanding about blockchain concept, in particular, is that
blockchain is decentralized and is not controlled by anyone. But the underlying
development of a blockchain system is still attributed to a cluster of core
developers. Take smart contract as an example, it is essentially a collection
of codes (or functions) and data (or states) that are programmed and deployed
on a blockchain (say, Ethereum) by different human programmers. It is thus,
unfortunately, less likely to be free of loopholes and flaws. In this article,
through a brief overview about how artificial intelligence could be used to
deliver bug-free smart contract so as to achieve the goal of blockchain 2.0, we
to emphasize that the blockchain implementation can be assisted or enhanced via
various AI techniques. The alliance of AI and blockchain is expected to create

The De-democratization of AI: Deep Learning and the Compute Divide in Artificial Intelligence Research,"  Increasingly, modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) research has become more
computationally intensive. However, a growing concern is that due to unequal
access to computing power, only certain firms and elite universities have
advantages in modern AI research. Using a novel dataset of 171394 papers from
57 prestigious computer science conferences, we document that firms, in
particular, large technology firms and elite universities have increased
participation in major AI conferences since deep learning's unanticipated rise
in 2012. The effect is concentrated among elite universities, which are ranked
1-50 in the QS World University Rankings. Further, we find two strategies
through which firms increased their presence in AI research: first, they have
increased firm-only publications; and second, firms are collaborating primarily
with elite universities. Consequently, this increased presence of firms and
elite universities in AI research has crowded out mid-tier (QS ranked 201-300)
and lower-tier (QS ranked 301-500) universities. To provide causal evidence
that deep learning's unanticipated rise resulted in this divergence, we
leverage the generalized synthetic control method, a data-driven counterfactual
estimator. Using machine learning based text analysis methods, we provide
additional evidence that the divergence between these two groups - large firms
and non-elite universities - is driven by access to computing power or compute,
which we term as the ""compute divide"". This compute divide between large firms
and non-elite universities increases concerns around bias and fairness within
AI technology, and presents an obstacle towards ""democratizing"" AI. These
results suggest that a lack of access to specialized equipment such as compute
can de-democratize knowledge production.

arguments that the resulting AIXI model is the most intelligent unbiased agent
possible. We outline for a number of problem classes, including sequence
prediction, strategic games, function minimization, reinforcement and

drawback of the AIXI model is that it is uncomputable. To overcome this

more intelligent than any other time t and space l bounded agent. The
computation time of AIXI-tl is of the order tx2^l. Other discussed topics are

competitiveness. In spite of this, the geography of their development and
diffusion has not received significant attention in the literature. We address
this with an analysis of Deep Learning (DL), a core technique in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) increasingly being recognized as the latest GPT. We identify
DL papers in a novel dataset from ArXiv, a popular preprints website, and use
CrunchBase, a technology business directory to measure industrial capabilities
related to it. After showing that DL conforms with the definition of a GPT,
having experienced rapid growth and diffusion into new fields where it has
generated an impact, we describe changes in its geography. Our analysis shows
China's rise in AI rankings and relative decline in several European countries.
We also find that initial volatility in the geography of DL has been followed
by consolidation, suggesting that the window of opportunity for new entrants
might be closing down as new DL research hubs become dominant. Finally, we
study the regional drivers of DL clustering. We find that competitive DL
clusters tend to be based in regions combining research and industrial
activities related to it. This could be because GPT developers and adopters
located close to each other can collaborate and share knowledge more easily,
thus overcoming coordination failures in GPT deployment. Our analysis also
reveals a Chinese comparative advantage in DL after we control for other
explanatory factors, perhaps underscoring the importance of access to data and
supportive policies for the successful development of this complex, `omni-use'

platforms have a great importance on enabling companies to design multimedia
oriented, interactive content. But on the other hand, there is still something
more to do for improved content marketing approaches. In this context,
objective of this study is to focus on intelligent content marketing, which can
be done by using artificial intelligence. Artificial Intelligence is todays one
of the most remarkable research fields and it can be used easily as
multidisciplinary. So, this study has aimed to discuss about its potential on
improving content marketing. In detail, the study has enabled readers to
improve their awareness about the intersection point of content marketing and
artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the authors have introduced some example
models of intelligent content marketing, which can be achieved by using current
Web technologies and artificial intelligence techniques.

Security and Privacy for Artificial Intelligence: Opportunities and Challenges,"  The increased adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents an
opportunity to solve many socio-economic and environmental challenges; however,
this cannot happen without securing AI-enabled technologies. In recent years,
most AI models are vulnerable to advanced and sophisticated hacking techniques.
This challenge has motivated concerted research efforts into adversarial AI,
with the aim of developing robust machine and deep learning models that are
resilient to different types of adversarial scenarios. In this paper, we
present a holistic cyber security review that demonstrates adversarial attacks
against AI applications, including aspects such as adversarial knowledge and
capabilities, as well as existing methods for generating adversarial examples
and existing cyber defence models. We explain mathematical AI models,
especially new variants of reinforcement and federated learning, to demonstrate
how attack vectors would exploit vulnerabilities of AI models. We also propose
a systematic framework for demonstrating attack techniques against AI
applications and reviewed several cyber defences that would protect AI
applications against those attacks. We also highlight the importance of
understanding the adversarial goals and their capabilities, especially the
recent attacks against industry applications, to develop adaptive defences that
assess to secure AI applications. Finally, we describe the main challenges and
future research directions in the domain of security and privacy of AI
technologies.

Artificial Intelligence for Social Good,"  The Computing Community Consortium (CCC), along with the White House Office
of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), and the Association for the
Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), co-sponsored a public workshop
on Artificial Intelligence for Social Good on June 7th, 2016 in Washington, DC.
This was one of five workshops that OSTP co-sponsored and held around the
country to spur public dialogue on artificial intelligence, machine learning,
and to identify challenges and opportunities related to AI. In the AI for
Social Good workshop, the successful deployments and the potential use of AI in
various topics that are essential for social good were discussed, including but
not limited to urban computing, health, environmental sustainability, and
public welfare. This report highlights each of these as well as a number of
crosscutting issues.

The Dataset Nutrition Label (2nd Gen): Leveraging Context to Mitigate Harms in Artificial Intelligence,"  As the production of and reliance on datasets to produce automated
decision-making systems (ADS) increases, so does the need for processes for
evaluating and interrogating the underlying data. After launching the Dataset
Nutrition Label in 2018, the Data Nutrition Project has made significant
updates to the design and purpose of the Label, and is launching an updated
Label in late 2020, which is previewed in this paper. The new Label includes
context-specific Use Cases &Alerts presented through an updated design and user
interface targeted towards the data scientist profile. This paper discusses the
harm and bias from underlying training data that the Label is intended to
mitigate, the current state of the work including new datasets being labeled,
new and existing challenges, and further directions of the work, as well as
Figures previewing the new label.

"Beyond STEM, How Can Women Engage Big Data, Analytics, Robotics and Artificial Intelligence? An Exploratory Analysis of Confidence and Educational Factors in the Emerging Technology Waves Influencing the Role of, and Impact Upon, Women","  In spite of the rapidly advancing global technological environment, the
professional participation of women in technology, big data, analytics,
artificial intelligence and information systems related domains remains
proportionately low. Furthermore, it is of no less concern that the number of
women in leadership in these domains are in even lower proportions. In spite of
numerous initiatives to improve the participation of women in technological
domains, there is an increasing need to gain additional insights into this
phenomenon especially since it occurs in nations and geographies which have
seen a sharp rise in overall female education, without such increase
translating into a corresponding spurt in information systems and technological
roles for women. The present paper presents findings from an exploratory
analysis and outlines a framework to gain insights into educational factors in
the emerging technology waves influencing the role of, and impact upon, women.
We specifically identify ways for learning and self-efficacy as key factors,
which together lead us to the Advancement of Women in Technology (AWT) insights
framework. Based on the AWT framework, we also proposition principles that can
be used to encourage higher professional engagement of women in emerging and
advanced technologies. Key Words- Women's Education, Technology, Artificial
Intelligence, Knowing, Confidence, Self-Efficacy, Learning.

Artificial Intelligence MArkup Language: A Brief Tutorial,"  The purpose of this paper is to serve as a reference guide for the
development of chatterbots implemented with the AIML language. In order to
achieve this, the main concepts in Pattern Recognition area are described
because the AIML uses such theoretical framework in their syntactic and
semantic structures. After that, AIML language is described and each AIML
command/tag is followed by an application example. Also, the usage of AIML
embedded tags for the handling of sequence dialogue limitations between humans
and machines is shown. Finally, computer systems that assist in the design of
chatterbots with the AIML language are classified and described.
