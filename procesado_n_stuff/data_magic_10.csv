Floquet engineering of interlayer couplings: Tuning the magic angle of twisted bilayer graphene at the exit of a waveguide,"  We introduce a new approach that allows one complete control over the
modulation of the effective twist angle change in few-layer van der Waals
heterostructures by irradiating them with longitudinal waves of light at the
end of a waveguide. As a specific application, we consider twisted bilayer
graphene and show that one can tune the magic angles to be either larger or
smaller, allowing in-situ experimental control of the phase diagram of this and
other related materials. A waveguide allows one to circumvent the free-space
constraints on the absence of longitudinal electric field components of light.
We propose to place twisted bilayer graphene at a specific location at the exit
of a waveguide, such that it is subjected to purely longitudinal components of
a transverse magnetic modes (TM) wave.

Tracing out Correlated Chern Insulators in Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene,"  Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) exhibits a range of correlated
phenomena that originate from strong electron-electron interactions. These
interactions make the Fermi surface highly susceptible to reconstruction when $
\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3$ electrons occupy each moir\' e unit cell and lead to the
formation of correlated insulating, superconducting and ferromagnetic phases.
While some phases have been shown to carry a non-zero Chern number, the local
microscopic properties and topological character of many other phases remain
elusive. Here we introduce a set of novel techniques hinging on scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM) to map out topological phases in MATBG that emerge
in finite magnetic field. By following the evolution of the local density of
states (LDOS) at the Fermi level with electrostatic doping and magnetic field,
we visualize a local Landau fan diagram that enables us to directly assign
Chern numbers to all observed phases. We uncover the existence of six
topological phases emanating from integer fillings in finite fields and whose
origin relates to a cascade of symmetry-breaking transitions driven by
correlations. The spatially resolved and electron-density-tuned LDOS maps
further reveal that these topological phases can form only in a small range of
twist angles around the magic-angle value. Both the microscopic origin and
extreme sensitivity to twist angle differentiate these topological phases from
the Landau levels observed near charge neutrality. Moreover, we observe that
even the charge-neutrality Landau spectrum taken at low fields is considerably
modified by interactions and exhibits an unexpected splitting between zero
Landau levels that can be as large as ${\sim }\,3-5$ meV. Our results show how
strong electronic interactions affect the band structure of MATBG and lead to
the formation of correlation-enabled topological phases.

A novel LIDAR-based Atmospheric Calibration Method for Improving the Data Analysis of MAGIC,"  A new method for analyzing the returns of the custom-made 'micro'-LIDAR
system, which is operated along with the two MAGIC telescopes, allows to apply
atmospheric corrections in the MAGIC data analysis chain. Such corrections make
it possible to extend the effective observation time of MAGIC under adverse
atmospheric conditions and reduce the systematic errors of energy and flux in
the data analysis. LIDAR provides a range-resolved atmospheric backscatter
profile from which the extinction of Cherenkov light from air shower events can
be estimated. Knowledge of the extinction can allow to reconstruct the true
image parameters, including energy and flux. Our final goal is to recover the
source-intrinsic energy spectrum also for data affected by atmospheric
extinction from aerosol layers, such as clouds.

Soft modes in magic angle twisted bilayer graphene,"  We present a systematic study of the low-energy collective modes for
different insulating states at integer fillings in twisted bilayer graphene. In
particular, we provide a simple counting rule for the total number of soft
modes, and analyze their energies and symmetry quantum numbers in detail. To
study the soft mode spectra, we employ time dependent Hartree-Fock whose
results are reproduced analytically via an effective sigma model description.
We find two different types of low-energy modes - (i) approximate Goldstone
modes associated with breaking an enlarged U(4)$\times$U(4) symmetry and,
surprisingly, a set of (ii) nematic modes with non-zero angular momentum under
three-fold rotation. The modes of type (i) include true gapless Goldstone modes
associated with exact symmetries in addition to gapped ""pseudo-Goldstone"" modes
associated with approximate symmetries. While the modes of type (ii) are always
gapped, we show that their gap decreases as the Berry curvature grows more
concentrated. For realistic parameter values, the gapped soft modes of both
types have comparable gaps of only a few meV, and lie completely inside the
mean-field bandgap. The entire set of soft modes emerge as Goldstone modes of a
different idealized model in which Berry flux is limited to a solenoid, which
enjoys an enlarged U(8) symmetry. Furthermore, we discuss the number of
Goldstone modes for each symmetry-broken state, distinguishing the linearly vs
quadratically dispersing modes. Finally, we present a general symmetry analysis
of the soft modes for all possible insulating Slater determinant states at
integer fillings that preserve translation symmetry, independent of the
energetic details. The resulting soft mode degeneracies and symmetry quantum
numbers provide a fingerprint of the different insulting states enabling their
experimental identification from a measurement of their soft modes.

Measurement of the cosmic electron plus positron spectrum with the MAGIC telescopes,"  Cosmic electrons with energies in the TeV range lose their energy rapidly
through synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton processes, resulting in a
relatively short lifetime (~ 10^5 years). They are only visible from
comparatively nearby sources (<1 kpc). Unexpected features in their spectrum at
a few hundreds GeV, as measured by several experiments (ATIC, Fermi and
H.E.S.S. among others), might be caused by local sources such as pulsars or by
dark matter annihilation/decay. In order to investigate these possibilities,
new measurements in the TeV energy region are needed. Since the completion of
the stereo system, the MAGIC Cherenkov experiment is sensitive enough to
measure the cosmic electron flux between a few hundred GeV and few TeV. The
electron signal has to be extracted from the overwhelming background of
hadronic cosmic rays estimated through Monte Carlo simulations. Here we present
the first results of the cosmic electron spectrum measured with the MAGIC
telescopes.

"Combined Dark Matter searches towards dwarf spheroidal galaxies with Fermi-LAT, HAWC, HESS, MAGIC and VERITAS","  The search for Dark Matter (DM) has great potential to reveal physics beyond
the Standard Model. As such, searches for evidence of DM particles are being
carried out using a wide range of techniques, such as direct searches for DM
particles, searches for DM produced with colliders, and indirect searches for
the Standard Model annihilation products of DM. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies
(dSphs) are excellent targets for indirect Dark Matter searches due to their
relatively high DM content and negligible expected astrophysical background. A
collaboration was formed to maximise the sensitivity of DM searches towards
dSphs by combining for the first time dSph data from three imaging air
Cherenkov telescope (IACT) arrays: HESS, MAGIC, and VERITAS; the Fermi-LAT
satellite, and the water Cherenkov detector HAWC. Due to the diverse nature of
the instruments involved, each experiment will analyse their individual
datasets from multiple targets and then the results will be combined at the
likelihood level. For consistency of the likelihoods across the five
experiments, a common approach is used to treat the astrophysical factor
(J-Factor) for each target and an agreed set of annihilation channels are
considered. We also agree on a common statistical approach and treatment of
instrumental systematic uncertainties. The results are presented in terms of
constraints on the velocity-weighted cross section for DM self-annihilation as
a function of the DM particle mass.

Quantum critical behavior in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene,"  The flat bands of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) host
strongly-correlated electronic phases such as correlated insulators,
superconductors and a strange-metal state. The latter state, believed to be key
for understanding the electronic properties of MATBG, is obscured by various
phase transitions and thus could not be unequivocally differentiated from a
metal undergoing frequent electron-phonon collisions. Here, we report transport
measurements in superconducting MATBG in which the correlated insulator states
are suppressed by screening. The uninterrupted metallic ground state shows
resistivity that is linear in temperature over three decades and spans a broad
range of doping including those where a correlation-driven Fermi surface
reconstruction occurs. This strange-metal behavior is distinguished by
Planckian scattering rates and a linear magnetoresistivity. In contrast, near
charge neutrality or a fully-filled flat band, as well as for devices twisted
away from the magic angle, we observe the archetypal Fermi liquid behavior. Our
measurements demonstrate the existence of a quantum critical phase whose
fluctuations dominate the metallic ground state throughout a continuum of
doping. Further, we observe a transition to the strange metal upon suppression
of the superconducting order, suggesting a relationship between quantum
fluctuations and superconductivity in MATBG.

Magic-Angle Multilayer Graphene: A Robust Family of Moiré Superconductors,"  The discovery of correlated states and superconductivity in magic-angle
twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has established moiré quantum matter as a
new platform to explore interaction-driven and topological quantum phenomena.
Multitudes of phases have been realized in moiré systems, but surprisingly,
robust superconductivity has been one of the least common of all, initially
found in MATBG and only more recently also in magic-angle twisted trilayer
graphene (MATTG). While MATBG and MATTG share some similar characteristics,
they also exhibit substantial differences, such as in their response to
external electric and magnetic fields. This raises the question of whether they
are simply two separate unique systems, or whether they form part of a broader
family of superconducting materials. Here, we report the experimental
realization of magic-angle twisted 4-layer and 5-layer graphene (MAT4G and
MAT5G, respectively), which turn out to be superconductors, hence establishing
alternating-twist magic-angle multilayer graphene as a robust family of moiré
superconductors. The members of this family have flat bands in their electronic
structure as a common feature, suggesting their central role in the observed
robust superconductivity. On the other hand, there are also important
variations across the family, such as different symmetries for members with
even and odd number of layers. However, our measurements in parallel magnetic
fields, in particular the investigation of Pauli limit violation and
spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking, reveal that the most pronounced
distinction is between the N=2 and N>2-layer structures. Our results expand the
emergent family of moiré superconductors, providing new insight with
potential implications for the design of novel superconducting materials
platforms.

Tunable Phase Boundaries and Ultra-Strong Coupling Superconductivity in Mirror Symmetric Magic-Angle Trilayer Graphene,"  Moiré superlattices have recently emerged as a novel platform where
correlated physics and superconductivity can be studied with unprecedented
tunability. Although correlated effects have been observed in several other
moiré systems, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) remains the only
one where robust superconductivity has been reproducibly measured. Here we
realize a new moiré superconductor, mirror symmetric magic-angle twisted
trilayer graphene (MATTG) with dramatically richer tunability in electronic
structure and superconducting properties. Hall effect and quantum oscillations
measurements as a function of density and electric field allow us to determine
the system's tunable phase boundaries in the normal state. Zero magnetic field
resistivity measurements then reveal that the existence of superconductivity is
intimately connected to the broken symmetry phase emerging from two carriers
per moiré unit cell. Strikingly, we find that the superconducting phase gets
suppressed and bounded at the van Hove singularities (vHs) partially
surrounding the broken-symmetry phase, which is difficult to reconcile with
weak-coupling BCS theory. Moreover, the extensive in situ tunability of our
system allows us to achieve the ultra-strong coupling regime, characterized by
a Ginzburg-Landau coherence length reaching the average inter-particle distance
and very large $T_\mathrm{BKT}/T_{F}$ ratios in excess of 0.1, where
$T_\mathrm{BKT}$ and $T_F$ are the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition
and Fermi temperatures, respectively. These observations suggest that MATTG can
be electrically tuned close to the two-dimensional BCS-BEC crossover. Our
results establish a new generation of tunable moiré superconductors with the
potential to revolutionize our fundamental understanding and the applications
of strong coupling superconductivity.

Mermin and Peres is rigid, in the sense that for any entangled strategy
succeeding with probability $1 -\varepsilon$, the players' shared state is
$O(\mathrm{poly}(n\varepsilon))$-close to $2n$ EPR pairs under a local

Collective excitations in twisted bilayer graphene close to the magic angle,"  The electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) can be
dramatically different from those of a single graphene layer, in particular
when the two layers are rotated relative to each other by a small angle. TBG
has recently attracted a great deal of interest, sparked by the discovery of
correlated insulating and superconducting states, for twist angle $\theta$
close to a so-called 'magic angle' $\approx 1.1°$. In this work, we
unveil, via near-field optical microscopy, a collective plasmon mode in
charge-neutral TBG near the magic angle, which is dramatically different from
the ordinary single-layer graphene intraband plasmon. In selected regions of
our samples, we find a gapped collective mode with linear dispersion, akin to
the bulk magnetoplasmons of a two-dimensional (2D) electron gas. We interpret
these as interband plasmons and associate those with the optical transitions
between quasi-localized states originating from the moiré superlattice.
Surprisingly, we find a higher plasmon group velocity than expected, which
implies an enhanced strength of the corresponding optical transition. This
points to a weaker interlayer coupling in the AA regions. These intriguing
optical properties offer new insights, complementary to other techniques, on
the carrier dynamics in this novel quantum electron system.

Field-tuned and zero-field fractional Chern insulators in magic angle graphene,"  In contrast to the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect, where electron
density fixes the applied magnetic field, fractional Chern insulators (FCIs)
can realize FQH states in comparatively weak or even zero magnetic fields.
Previous theoretical work highlighted magic angle graphene as a promising FCI
platform, satisfying the twin requirements of flat bands and
lowest-Landau-level-like quantum geometry. Indeed, recent experiments have
demonstrated FCIs in magic angle graphene with weak magnetic fields. Here we
conduct a detailed theoretical study of the most prominent FCI state observed,
and clarify the role of the magnetic field in stabilizing this state. We
introduce two new technical tools: first, we generalize the notion of ideal
quantum geometry to Hofstadter minibands and, second, we extend the
Hartree-Fock theory of magic-angle graphene to finite field, to account for the
interaction generated bandwidth. We show that magnetic field both dramatically
reduces the effective bandwidth and improves the quantum geometry for hosting
FCIs. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of a
microscopic model of magic angle graphene, we establish the regime of bandwidth
and quantum geometry indicators where FCIs are stabilized. Further
characterizing the finite-field bands by the same quantities we show how a
zero-field charge density wave state gives way to an FCI state at a magnetic
flux consistent with experiment. We also speculate on the other FCIs seen in
the same experiments, including anomalous incompressible states and
even-denominator fractions which may host non-Abelian states. Finally, when
bandwidth is the limiting factor, we propose a range of experimental parameters
where FCIs should appear at zero magnetic field.

while players limited to classical operations cannot do so, a phenomenon dubbed

The Active Mirror Control of the MAGIC Telescope,"  One of the main design goals of the MAGIC telescopes is the very fast
repositioning in case of Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) alarms, implying a low weight of
the telescope dish. This is accomplished by using a space frame made of carbon
fiber epoxy tubes, resulting in a strong but not very rigid support structure.
Therefore it is necessary to readjust the individual mirror tiles to correct
for deformations of the dish under varying gravitational load while tracking an
object. We present the concept of the Active Mirror Control (AMC) as
implemented in the MAGIC telescopes and the actual performance reached.
Additionally we show that also telescopes using a stiff structure can benefit
from using an AMC.

Large Pauli Limit Violation and Reentrant Superconductivity in Magic-Angle Twisted Trilayer Graphene,"  Moiré quantum matter has emerged as a novel materials platform where
correlated and topological phases can be explored with unprecedented control.
Among them, magic-angle systems constructed from two or three layers of
graphene have shown robust superconducting phases with unconventional
characteristics. However, direct evidence for unconventional pairing remains to
be experimentally demonstrated. Here, we show that magic-angle twisted trilayer
graphene (MATTG) exhibits superconductivity up to in-plane magnetic fields in
excess of 10 T, which represents a large ($2\sim3$ times) violation of the
Pauli limit for conventional spin-singlet superconductors. This observation is
surprising for a system which is not expected to have strong spin-orbit
coupling. Furthermore, the Pauli limit violation is observed over the entire
superconducting phase, indicating that it is not related to a possible
pseudogap phase with large superconducting amplitude pairing. More strikingly,
we observe reentrant superconductivity at large magnetic fields, which is
present in a narrower range of carrier density and displacement field. These
findings suggest that the superconductivity in MATTG is likely driven by a
mechanism resulting in non-spin-singlet Cooper pairs, where the external
magnetic field can cause transitions between phases with potentially different
order parameters. Our results showcase the richness of moiré
superconductivity and may pave a new route towards designing next-generation
exotic quantum matter.

Magnetic Josephson Junctions and Superconducting Diodes in Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene,"  The simultaneous co-existence and gate-tuneability of the superconducting
(SC), magnetic and topological orders in magic angle twisted bilayer graphene
(MATBG) open up entirely new possibilities for the creation of complex hybrid
Josephson junctions (JJ). Here we report on the creation of gate-defined,
magnetic Josephson junctions in MATBG, where the weak link is gate-tuned close
to the correlated state at a moiré filling factor of {\nu}=-2. A highly
unconventional Fraunhofer pattern emerges, which is phase-shifted and
asymmetric with respect to the current and magnetic field directions, and shows
a pronounced magnetic hysteresis. Interestingly, our theoretical calculations
of the JJ with a valley polarized {\nu}=-2 with orbital magnetization as the
weak link explain most of these unconventional features without fine tuning the
parameters. While these unconventional Josephson effects persist up to the
critical temperature Tc ~ 3.5K of the superconducting state, at temperatures
below T < 800mK, we observed a pronounced magnetic hysteresis possibly due to
further spin-polarization of the {\nu}=-2 state. We demonstrate how the
combination of magnetization and its current induced magnetization switching in
the MATBG JJ allows us to realize a programmable zero field superconducting
diode, which represents a major building block for a new generation of
superconducting quantum electronics.

"Combined dark matter searches towards dwarf spheroidal galaxies with Fermi-LAT, HAWC, H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS","  Cosmological and astrophysical observations suggest that 85\% of the total
matter of the Universe is made of Dark Matter (DM). However, its nature remains
one of the most challenging and fundamental open questions of particle physics.
Assuming particle DM, this exotic form of matter cannot consist of Standard
Model (SM) particles. Many models have been developed to attempt unraveling the
nature of DM such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), the most
favored particle candidates. WIMP annihilations and decay could produce SM
particles which in turn hadronize and decay to give SM secondaries such as high
energy $\gamma$ rays. In the framework of indirect DM search, observations of
promising targets are used to search for signatures of DM annihilation. Among
these, the dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are commonly favored owing to
their expected high DM content and negligible astrophysical background. In this
work, we present the very first combination of 20 dSph observations, performed
by the Fermi-LAT, HAWC, H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS collaborations in order to
maximize the sensitivity of DM searches and improve the current results. We use
a joint maximum likelihood approach combining each experiment's individual
analysis to derive more constraining upper limits on the WIMP DM
self-annihilation cross-section as a function of DM particle mass. We present
new DM constraints over the widest mass range ever reported, extending from 5

Twistons in a Sea of Magic,"  Magic angle twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) has recently emerged as a new
platform to engineer strongly correlated flat bands. Here, we reveal the
structural and electronic properties of TTG using low temperature scanning
tunneling microscopy at twist angles for which superconductivity has been
observed. Real trilayer samples deviate from their idealized structure due to a
strong reconstruction of the moiré lattice, which locks layers into
near-magic angle, mirror symmetric domains comparable in size to the
superconducting coherence length. The price for this magic relaxation is the
introduction of an array of localized twist angle faults, termed twistons.
These novel, gate-tunable moiré defects offer a natural explanation for the
superconducting dome observed in transport and provide an avenue to probe
superconducting pairing mechanisms through disorder tuning.

Critical magnetic fields and electron-pairing in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene,"  The velocities of the quasiparticles that form Cooper pairs in a
superconductor are revealed by the upper critical magnetic field. Here we use
this property to assess superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer
graphene (MATBG), which has been observed over a range of moiré band filling,
twist angle, and screening environment conditions. We find that for pairing
mechanisms that are unrelated to correlations within the MATBG flat bands,
minima in an average Fermi velocity $v_F^* \equiv k_B T_c \ell_c /\hbar $,
where $\ell_c$ is the magnetic length at the critical perpendicular magnetic
field, are always coincident with transition temperature maxima. Both extrema
occur near flat-band van Hove singularities. Since no such association is
present in MATBG experimental data, we conclude that electronic correlations
that yield a band-filling-dependent pairing glue must play a crucial role in
MATBG superconductivity.

Magic-angle graphene superlattices: a new platform for unconventional superconductivity,"  The understanding of strongly-correlated materials, and in particular
unconventional superconductors, has puzzled physicists for decades. Such
difficulties have stimulated new research paradigms, such as ultra-cold atom
lattices for simulating quantum materials. Here we report on the realization of
intrinsic unconventional superconductivity in a 2D superlattice created by
stacking two graphene sheets with a small twist angle. For angles near
$1.1^\circ$, the first `magic' angle, twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) exhibits
ultra-flat bands near charge neutrality, which lead to correlated insulating
states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping away from these correlated
insulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical
temperature $T_c$ up to 1.7 K. The temperature-density phase diagram shows
similarities with that of the cuprates, including superconducting domes.
Moreover, quantum oscillations indicate small Fermi surfaces near the
correlated insulating phase, in analogy with under-doped cuprates. The relative
high $T_c$, given such small Fermi surface (corresponding to a record-low 2D
carrier density of $10^{11} \textrm{cm}^{-2}$ , renders TBG among the strongest
coupling superconductors, in a regime close to the BCS-BEC crossover. These
novel results establish TBG as the first purely carbon-based 2D superconductor
and as a highly tunable platform to investigate strongly-correlated phenomena,
which could lead to insights into the physics of high-$T_c$ superconductors and

In particular, we show that vanishing of the first Bloch eigenvalue away from

a flat band. We then study how the multiplicity of the flat band is related to
the nodal set of the Bloch eigenfunctions. We also demonstrate that for a

other Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope arrays, MAGIC has operated for five years

throughout this time. To improve the analysis, we used techniques like the
random forest event classification method for different purposes, and
sophisticated image cleaning algorithms. The monoscopic performance was
optimized in the energy domain around and below 100 GeV, which is inaccessible
for the other arrays of Cherenkov telescopes. Still, with these analysis
techniques, we were competitive also in the TeV regime. In the recent

parameter sets are used in the present analysis. The respective shifts over the
isotopic chain for the structural observables and surface property like
symmetry energy are also estimated using a three-point method, which is crucial
for the systematic analysis of the shell/sub-shell closure. The calculated
results are compared with the available experimental data for various bulk
properties, wherever available. A multiple isotopic shifts leads to the
shell/sub-shell closure at N = (20 \& 28), (50 \& 82), and 126 for Ca, Sn, and

magic at N = 40 and 184 for highly neutron-rich $^{60}$Ca, and $^{304}$120,
predicted to be the next double magic beyond $^{208}$Pb, respectively.
Observing the occupancy number, we notice the higher neutron orbitals are
mostly occupied before the lower one, which causes the kinks at neutron magic
with an amalgam in the isotopic chain trend above nuclei. We also notice the

Magic ELF: Image Deraining Meets Association Learning and Transformer,"  Convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer have achieved great
success in multimedia applications. However, little effort has been made to
effectively and efficiently harmonize these two architectures to satisfy image
deraining. This paper aims to unify these two architectures to take advantage
of their learning merits for image deraining. In particular, the local
connectivity and translation equivariance of CNN and the global aggregation
ability of self-attention (SA) in Transformer are fully exploited for specific
local context and global structure representations. Based on the observation
that rain distribution reveals the degradation location and degree, we
introduce degradation prior to help background recovery and accordingly present

Complex instruction set computing architecture for performing accurate quantum $Z$ rotations with less magic,"  We present quantum protocols for executing arbitrarily accurate $\pi/2^k$
rotations of a qubit about its $Z$ axis. Reduced instruction set computing
(\textsc{risc}) architectures typically restrict the instruction set to
stabilizer operations and a single non-stabilizer operation, such as
preparation of a ""magic"" state from which $T = Z(\pi/4)$ gates can be
teleported. Although the overhead required to distill high-fidelity copies of
this magic state is high, the subsequent quantum compiling overhead to realize
$Z$ rotations in a \textsc{risc} architecture can be much greater. We develop a
complex instruction set computing (\textsc{cisc}) architecture whose
instruction set includes stabilizer operations and preparation of magic states
from which $Z(\pi/2^k)$ gates can be teleported, for $2 \leq k \leq
k_{\text{max}}$. This results in a substantial overall reduction in the number
of gates required to achieve a desired gate accuracy for $Z$ rotations. The key
to our construction is a family of shortened quantum Reed-Muller codes of
length $2^{k+2}-1$, whose magic-state distillation threshold shrinks with $k$
but is greater than 0.85% for $k \leq 6$.

Integrability in the chiral model of magic angles,"  Magic angles in the chiral model of twisted bilayer graphene are parameters
for which the chiral version of the Bistritzer--MacDonald Hamiltonian exhibits
a flat band at energy zero. We compute the sums over powers of (complex) magic
angles and use that to show that the set of magic angles is infinite. We also
provide a new proof of the existence of the first real magic angle, showing
also that the corresponding flat band has minimal multiplicity for the simplest
possible choice of potentials satisfying all symmetries. These results indicate
(though not prove) a hidden integrability of the chiral model.

Stabilizer Rényi entropy,"  We introduce a novel measure for the quantum property of nonstabilizerness -
commonly known as ""magic"" - by considering the Rényi entropy of the
probability distribution associated to a pure quantum state given by the square
of the expectation value of Pauli strings in that state. We show that this is a
good measure of nonstabilizerness from the point of view of resource theory and
show bounds with other known measures. The stabilizer Rényi entropy has the
advantage of being easily computable because it does not need a minimization
procedure. We present a protocol for an experimental measurement by randomized
measurements. We show that the nonstabilizerness is intimately connected to
out-of-time-order correlation functions and that maximal levels of
nonstabilizerness are necessary for quantum chaos.

A lower bound on intergalactic magnetic fields from time variability of 1ES 0229+200 from MAGIC and Fermi/LAT observations,"  Extended and delayed emission around distant TeV sources induced by the
effects of propagation of gamma rays through the intergalactic medium can be
used for the measurement of the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF). We search
for delayed GeV emission from the hard-spectrum TeV blazar 1ES 0229+200 with
the goal to detect or constrain the IGMF-dependent secondary flux generated
during the propagation of TeV gamma rays through the intergalactic medium. We
analyze the most recent MAGIC observations over a 5 year time span and
complement them with historic data of the H.E.S.S. and VERITAS telescopes along
with a 12-year long exposure of the Fermi/LAT telescope. We use them to trace
source evolution in the GeV-TeV band over one-and-a-half decade in time. We use
Monte Carlo simulations to predict the delayed secondary gamma-ray flux,
modulated by the source variability, as revealed by TeV-band observations. We
then compare these predictions for various assumed IGMF strengths to all
available measurements of the gamma-ray flux evolution. We find that the source
flux in the energy range above 200 GeV experiences variations around its
average on the 14 years time span of observations. No evidence for the flux
variability is found in 1-100 GeV energy range accessible to Fermi/LAT.
Non-detection of variability due to delayed emission from electromagnetic
cascade developing in the intergalactic medium imposes a lower bound of
B>1.8e-17 G for long correlation length IGMF and B>1e-14 G for an IGMF of the
cosmological origin. Though weaker than the one previously derived from the
analysis of Fermi/LAT data, this bound is more robust, being based on a
conservative intrinsic source spectrum estimate and accounting for the details
of source variability in the TeV energy band. We discuss implications of this
bound for cosmological magnetic fields which might explain the baryon asymmetry
of the Universe.

Magic entanglement renormalization for quantum fields,"  Continuous tensor networks are variational wavefunctions proposed in recent
years to efficiently simulate quantum field theories (QFTs). Prominent examples
include the continuous matrix product state (cMPS) and the continuous
multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (cMERA). While the cMPS can
approximate ground states of a class of QFT Hamiltonians that are both local
and interacting, cMERA is only well-understood for QFTs that are quasi-local
and non-interacting. In this paper we propose the magic cMERA, a concrete
realization of cMERA for a free boson QFT that simultaneously satisfies four
remarkable properties: (i) it is the exact ground state of a strictly local
Hamiltonian; (ii) in the massless case, its spectrum of scaling operators is
exactly soluble in real space; (iii) it has the short-distance structure of a
cMPS; (iv) it is generated by a quasi-local entangler that can be written as a
continuous matrix product operator. None of these properties is fulfilled by
previous cMERA proposals. Properties (iii)-(iv) establish a firm connection
between cMERA and cMPS wavefunctionals, opening the path to applying powerful
cMPS numerical techniques, valid for interacting QFTs, also to cMERA
calculations.

"MAGIC: a general, powerful and tractable method for selective inference","  Selective inference is a recent research topic that tries to perform valid
inference after using the data to select a reasonable statistical model. We
propose MAGIC, a new method for selective inference that is general, powerful
and tractable. MAGIC is a method for selective inference after solving a convex
optimization problem with smooth loss and $\ell_1$ penalty. Randomization is
incorporated into the optimization problem to boost statistical power. Through
reparametrization, MAGIC reduces the problem into a sampling problem with
simple constraints. MAGIC applies to many $\ell_1$ penalized optimization
problem including the Lasso, logistic Lasso and neighborhood selection in
graphical models, all of which we consider in this paper.

Chaos by Magic,"  There is a property of a quantum state called magic. It measures how
difficult for a classical computer to simulate the state. In this paper, we
study magic of states in the integrable and chaotic regimes of the higher-spin
generalization of the Ising model through two quantities called ""Mana"" and
""Robustness of Magic"" (RoM). We find that in the chaotic regime, Mana increases
monotonically in time in the early-time region, and at late times these
quantities oscillate around some non-zero value that increases linearly with
respect to the system size. Our result also suggests that under chaotic
dynamics, any state evolves to a state whose Mana almost saturates the optimal
upper bound, i.e., the state becomes ""maximally magical."" We find that RoM also
shows similar behaviors. On the other hand, in the integrable regime, Mana and
RoM behave periodically in time in contrast to the chaotic case. In the anti-de
Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence (AdS/CFT correspondence),
classical spacetime emerges from the chaotic nature of the dual quantum system.
Our result suggests that magic of quantum states is strongly involved behind
the emergence of spacetime geometry.

Magic angles and correlations in twisted nodal superconductors,"  Motivated by recent advances in the fabrication of twisted bilayers of 2D
materials, we consider the low-energy properties of a twisted pair of
two-dimensional nodal superconductors. We study both the cases of singlet and
triplet superconductors. It is demonstrated that the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG)
quasiparticle dispersion undergoes dramatic reconstruction due to the twist. In
particular, the velocity of the neutral massless Dirac excitations near the gap
nodes is strongly renormalized by the interlayer hopping and vanishes at a
``magic angle'' where in the limit of a circular Fermi surface a quadratic band
touching is formed. In addition, it is shown that the BdG disperion can be
tuned with an interlayer displacement field, magnetic field, and current, which
can suppress the velocity renormalization, create finite BdG Fermi surfaces, or
open a gap, respectively. Finally, interactions between quasiparticles are
shown to lead to the emergence of a correlated superconducting state breaking
time-reversal symmetry in the vicinity of the magic angle. Estimates of the
magic angle in a variety of nodal superconductors are presented, ranging from
the cuprates to the organic and heavy fermion superconductors, all of which are
shown to be promising for the experimental realization of our proposal.

Goodness of Generalized Seniority in Semi-magic Nuclei,"  Symmetry plays an important role in understanding the nuclear structure
properties from the rotation of a nucleus to the spin, parity and isospin of
nuclear states. This simplifies the complexity of the nuclear problems in one
way or the other. Seniority is also a well known quantum number which arises
due to the symmetry in the pairing interaction of nuclei. We present empirical
as well as theoretical evidences based on decay rates which support the
goodness of seniority at higher spins as well as in nrich or, n-deficient
nuclei. We find that the generalized seniority governs the identical trends of
high-spin isomers in different semi-magic chains, where different set of
nucleon orbitals from different valence spaces are involved.

Magic Fermions: Carroll and Flat Bands,"  The Carroll algebra is constructed as the $c\to0$ limit of the Poincare
algebra and is associated to symmetries on generic null surfaces. In this
paper, we begin investigations of Carrollian fermions or fermions defined on
generic null surfaces. Due to the availability of two different (degenerate)
metrics on Carroll spacetimes, there is the possibility of two different
versions of Carroll Clifford algebras. We consider both possibilities and
construct explicit representations of Carrollian gamma matrices and show how to
build higher spacetime dimensional representations out of lower ones. Actions
for Carroll fermions are constructed with these gamma matrices and the
properties of these actions are investigated.

"First Combined Study on LIV from Observations of Energy-dependent Time Delays from Multiple-type Gamma-ray Sources -- Part I. Motivation, Method Description and Validation through Simulations of H.E.S.S., MAGIC and VERITAS Datasets","  Gamma-ray astronomy has become one of the main experimental ways to test the
modified dispersion relations (MDRs) of photons in vacuum, obtained in some
attempts to formulate a theory of Quantum Gravity. The MDRs in use imply time
delays which depend on the energy, and which increase with distance following
some function of redshift. The use of transient, or variable, distant and
highly energetic sources, already allows us to set stringent limits on the
energy scale related to this phenomenon, usually thought to be of the order of
the Planck energy, but robust conclusions on the existence of MDR-related
propagation effects still require the analysis of a large population of
sources.

Moiré Landau fans and magic zeros,"  We study the energy spectrum of moiré systems under a uniform magnetic
field. The superlattice potential generally broadens Landau levels into Chern
bands with finite bandwidth. However, we find that these Chern bands become
flat at a discrete set of magnetic fields which we dub ""magic zeros"". The flat
band subspace is generally different from the Landau level subspace in the
absence of the moiré superlattice. By developing a semiclassical quantization
method and taking account of superlattice induced Bragg reflection, we prove
that magic zeros arise from the simultaneous quantization of two distinct
$k$-space orbits. The flat bands at magic zeros provide a new setting for
exploring crystalline fractional quantum Hall physics.
