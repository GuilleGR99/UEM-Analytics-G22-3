doi:10.1007/978-981-19-1484-3_13,en,"Design of Hybrid Soft Computing Techniques for Estimation of Suspended Sediment Yield in Krishna River, India",OriginalPaper,"This paper explores the soft-computing approaches for estimating suspended sediment yield (SSY). In the management of water resources, the SSY estimation is an important issue. The SSY estimation is essential for getting the information about mass balancing between the land and ocean.  The traditional methods for measuring the SSY require larger magnitudes of time and significant financial investments. Also, the SSY depends on numerous variables and their internal relationship which are extremely nonlinear and complex in nature. Thus, traditional methods are not capable to handle the complex nonlinear sedimentation behaviors and unable to accurate estimation of SSY. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN)-based genetic algorithm (GA) model is used for SSY prediction which resolves complex sedimentations problems. In this proposed model, the GA optimized all ANN’s model parameters simultaneously. The input functional parameters that impact the SSY in the Krishna River are water discharge and water level. This paper presents artificial intelligence-based sediment yield estimation algorithms at Waddepally gauge station in Krishna River, India. The GA is used for the optimization of the performance of ANN in accurately estimating the SSY. The hybrid GA-based ANN (GA-ANN) has produced most accurate and efficient results for estimation of SSY in Krishna River.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']",this paper explores the softcomputing approaches for estimating suspended sediment yield ssy in the management of water resources the ssy estimation is an important issue the ssy estimation is essential for getting the information about mass balancing between the land and ocean  the traditional methods for measuring the ssy require larger magnitudes of time and significant financial investments also the ssy depends on numerous variables and their internal relationship which are extremely nonlinear and complex in nature thus traditional methods are not capable to handle the complex nonlinear sedimentation behaviors and unable to accurate estimation of ssy the multilayer perceptron mlp artificial neural network annbased genetic algorithm ga model is used for ssy prediction which resolves complex sedimentations problems in this proposed model the ga optimized all anns model parameters simultaneously the input functional parameters that impact the ssy in the krishna river are water discharge and water level this paper presents artificial intelligencebased sediment yield estimation algorithms at waddepally gauge station in krishna river india the ga is used for the optimization of the performance of ann in accurately estimating the ssy the hybrid gabased ann gaann has produced most accurate and efficient results for estimation of ssy in krishna river,this paper explores the softcomputing approaches for accurate estimation of suspended sediment yield ( ssy ) in the management of water resources the ssy estimation is an important issue the ssy estimation is essential for getting the information about mass balancing between the land,"['##zed' 'ann' 'artificial intelligencebased sediment yield estimation'

Following a review of the different formulations, simulation results obtained from three alternative formulations are compared with experimental and numerical data. Results obtained by 2D and 3D test cases indicate that the predictive differences returned by the different formulations remain small for most applications, in particular for small porous Reynolds number Re P < 5000. Thus it seems justified to select a simplified formulation that supports an efficient algorithm and coding structure in a computational fluid dynamics environment.

Better robustness to affine transformation and overlapping image detection are some of the benefits associated with CapsNets. However, CapsNets cannot be classified as a resource-efficient deep learning architecture due to the high number of Primary Capsules (PCs). In addition, CapsNets’ training and testing are slow and resource hungry. In this chapter, we propose two methods to reduce PCs to make CapsNet resource-efficient. In our first approach, we introduce Light and Enhanced Capsule Network (LE-CapsNet). In LE-CapsNet we modify the CapsNet architecture by introducing the Primary Capsule Generator (PCG) module. We further compress this network by optimizing the feature extraction and introduce LE-CapsNet-T as a tiny variant of the network.

Plenty of numerical schemes can be employed in predicting and analysing the discontinuities flow phenomena that may present in the high-speed flow. These schemes have been integrated into software packages such as Open-source Field Operation and Manipulation (OpenFOAM) and ANSYS, which incorporate a graphical user interface (GUI) that complicates user interaction and are computationally demanding. The previous implementation of the Flux Vector Splitting (FVS) schemes is limited to a typical wave propagating flow only. Hence, the objective of this research is to develop a first-order Flux Vector Splitting (FVS) schemes and extend the solution capabilities to flow with two shocks such as the Woodward-Collela blast wave problem. Three FVS schemes have been selected, Steger-Warming, Van Leer, and Liou-Steffen scheme. Execution of these schemes over the test cases has shown different flow patterns according to each test case's extremities. The ability of the schemes in capturing shock is also analysed. The results over the one-dimensional test cases have shown that the Steger-Warming scheme produced the largest dissipation. In contrast, the Liou-Steffen scheme has shown itself as the most accurate, with very few overshoots and undershoots. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK) method augmented with second-order Time Variation Diminishing (TVD) has been previously implemented but limited to internal flow within a body surface. This research aims to extend the capabilities of the method for previously untested geometries such as flow over a wedge and a blunt-body. The results obtained from the scheme exhibits oblique shock waves at the compression corners and expansion waves at expansion corners. The presence of the waves is apparent at Mach number M∞ = 2.0 for the inlet, wedge, and bump channel geometries, while bow shocks can be simulated using the blunt-body geometry.

Ineffective administration of drugs can cause serious side effects and lead to death. Early identification of drug interactions helps to effectively manage drugs. We propose a method called Ensemble BIO BERT CHEM DDI a Framework, which aims to identify potential patterns in the molecular structure of drugs. The 2013 DDI interaction dataset is considered for analysis at the molecular level. Historical analysis of similar studies proven that it is time-consuming and high-complexity problem to solve. A solution that can predict accurate drug–drug interactions can save millions of lives years. A total of 730 drug library documents were processed to understand the relationship between drug interactions. The Ensemble BERT CHEM DDI model framework is designed to predict five different categories (negative, effect, query, severe effect, and metabolism). The performance of the model is better than the previous literature. The f1 score is increased by 3%, and the model accuracy is improved by 6%.

The first module learns job posting representations from textual content and metadata attributes in an unsupervised way. The second module learns job seeker representations from job application records and metadata attributes. It includes a personalized-attention mechanism that adapts the importance of each job in the learned career preference representation to the profile of a specific job seeker. The third module then models the Next-Application Prediction task as a top- K search process based on the similarity of representations. Text content plays a major role in describing job postings, and how the job content is encoded affects the model performance. Therefore, we explore the utility of different content encoding methods.

However, the target’s position is often known intermittently in the real world, e.g., in the case of using surveillance cameras. Our goal is to help user find a dynamic target efficiently in the real world when the target’s position is intermittently known. In order to achieve this purpose, we have designed an AR guidance assistance system to provide optimal current directional guidance to users, based on searching a prediction graph. We assume that a certain number of depth cameras are fixed in a real scene to obtain dynamic target’s position. The system automatically analyzes all possible meetings between the user and the target, and generates optimal directional guidance to help the user catch up with the target. A user study was used to evaluate our method, and its results showed that compared to free search and a top-view method, our method significantly improves target search efficiency.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Graphics', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision']",when searching for a dynamic target in an unknown real world scene search efficiency is greatly reduced if users lack information about the spatial structure of the scene most target search studies especially in robotics focus on determining either the shortest path when the targets position is known or a strategy to find the target as quickly as possible when the targets position is unknown however the targets position is often known intermittently in the real world eg in the case of using surveillance cameras our goal is to help user find a dynamic target efficiently in the real world when the targets position is intermittently known in order to achieve this purpose we have designed an ar guidance assistance system to provide optimal current directional guidance to users based on searching a prediction graph we assume that a certain number of depth cameras are fixed in a real scene to obtain dynamic targets position the system automatically analyzes all possible meetings between the user and the target and generates optimal directional guidance to help the user catch up with the target a user study was used to evaluate our method and its results showed that compared to free search and a topview method our method significantly improves target search efficiency,when searching for a dynamic target in an unknown real world scene search efficiency is greatly reduced if users lack information about the spatial structure of the scene most target search studies focus on determining either the shortest path when the targets position is known or a strategy to,"['ar guidance assistance system' 'depth cameras' 'directional guidance'

The relevant institutional interventions and research were selected for an institutional analysis through a snowball sampling approach, starting from a recent Australian initiative to increase women’s participation in trades. Five institutional logics are identified that are driving and legitimating the gender equality agenda: the masculinity logic, the market logic, the feminism logic, the humanity logic and the femininity logic. The review starts from a focus on ‘women’ and ends with a focus on ‘femininity’. Key findings are: (1) Feminism in the current practice presumes a gender contradiction which mirrors the masculinity logic. (2) Professionalism, the logic of the work, is missing from the current gender equality discourses. (3) A distinction is drawn between the ideology of feminism and the general trait of femininity. (4) Complexity within feminism needs further study. The results suggest to foster the femininity logic through ungendered job roles and a caring, engaging and nurturing on-job practice, illustrated with three examples.

However, there are limitations to FIB as accurate indicators of the presence of pathogens of concern, such as Cryptosporidium , as well as in the time-delay in FIB measurement. The objective of this work was to improve microbial water quality assessments by using data-driven approaches to predict day-to-day FIB, Escherichia coli ( E. coli ), and Cryptosporidium spp. concentrations based on simple water quality measures and weather data that can be monitored in real-time. To achieve this, we investigated the applicability of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs), an Artificial Intelligence-type algorithm that can provide probabilistic predictions using distinct data sources. Compared to other standard prediction methods, BBNs were observed to improve performance significantly and achieved greater than 75% accuracy for predicting FIB and E. coli concentrations. Following success in predicting FIB, predictability of Cryptosporidium , one of the major contributors to worldwide waterborne disease, was then investigated. One of the major challenges of modelling this parasite is dealing with a high number of non-detects and sparse data. Applicability of novel data augmentation and oversampling algorithms, such as the Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Algorithm (ADASYN), was investigated to improve the prediction model's performance. Leveraging the capability of the ADASYN significantly improved prediction performance of Cryptosporidium level presence, with 65% accuracy. The approach presented in this study can address the challenges of limited and time-delayed microbial water quality information and can be used to improve risk-based management and monitoring of water sources.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']",assessment of microbial quality of drinking water sources and recreational waters is highly dependent on measuring levels of fecal indicator bacteria fib however there are limitations to fib as accurate indicators of the presence of pathogens of concern such as cryptosporidium  as well as in the timedelay in fib measurement the objective of this work was to improve microbial water quality assessments by using datadriven approaches to predict daytoday fib escherichia coli  e coli  and cryptosporidium spp concentrations based on simple water quality measures and weather data that can be monitored in realtime to achieve this we investigated the applicability of bayesian belief networks bbns an artificial intelligencetype algorithm that can provide probabilistic predictions using distinct data sources compared to other standard prediction methods bbns were observed to improve performance significantly and achieved greater than  accuracy for predicting fib and e coli concentrations following success in predicting fib predictability of cryptosporidium  one of the major contributors to worldwide waterborne disease was then investigated one of the major challenges of modelling this parasite is dealing with a high number of nondetects and sparse data applicability of novel data augmentation and oversampling algorithms such as the adaptive synthetic sampling algorithm adasyn was investigated to improve the prediction models performance leveraging the capability of the adasyn significantly improved prediction performance of cryptosporidium level presence with  accuracy the approach presented in this study can address the challenges of limited and timedelayed microbial water quality information and can be used to improve riskbased management and monitoring of water sources,bayesian belief networks ( bbns ) and adaptive synthetic sampling algorithm ( adasyn ) were observed to improve prediction performance significantly and achieved greater than accuracy for predicting fib and e coli concentrations following success in predicting fib predictability of crypto,"['adaptive synthetic sampling algorithm'

Protecting them with passwords or even encrypting them still leaves some loopholes in the system. The attacker uses the concept of brute force to predict passwords and hack the system. To protect and prevent the system, many policies related to passwords are adopted. This includes continuous updating of passwords, which creates another stress to memorize them.

This is known as Explainable Artificial Intelligence and there has been a lot of research in this field over the last few years mainly focusing on how to explain different types of models. The advancement of this research, raised a very important query: “Why does a model need to be explained?” So, the most accurate answer to this question is “TRUST”. TRUST that the models are making the correct decisions over the correct assumptions. TRUST that we can tell what happened when a model fails. TRUST that we can do on a model implemented on a large scale that the predictions are made in line with expectations. It’s hard to trust a system that’s not transparent about its internal processes.

Therefore, developing an automatic short text classification model concerning low-resource languages, including Bengali, is critical. Moreover, the crucial barrier to classifying short text in Bengali is the unavailability of text corpora, scarcity of linguistics tools, a limited number of words in the text, and a lack of dependencies between the words.

doi:10.1007/978-981-19-3124-6_9,en,Algorithms to Reduce Depth Errors,OriginalPaper,"In SS-3D micro EDM, the depth errors of 3D micro cavity are accumulated layer by layer due to the contour scanning process with keeping discharge gaps for compensating axial tool-electrode wear in real time. In this study, the reason of the depth errors is analyzed, and then a layer depth constrained algorithm (LDCA) and an S-curve accelerating algorithm (SCAA) are proposed to reduce the depth errors. By using LDCA, over-cutting errors can be avoided by controlling a feeding maximum at every scanning spot. As a supplementary algorithm of LDCA, SCAA can compensate insufficient-machining errors at the start and end of scanning paths. Implementation process and control strategy of the algorithms are also described. The purpose of this study is to efficiently machine complex 3D micro-cavities with high accuracy of shape and surface. Machining experiments are carried out to verify the proposed algorithms.

doi:10.1007/978-981-19-0105-8_3,en,An Irrigation Support System Using Regressor Assembly,OriginalPaper,"In India, the agriculture sector uses about 84% of the total available water for irrigation. Most of the irrigation is surface-based, and nearly 40% of the irrigation water is wasted due to the unscientific practices adopted by the rural farmers to estimate the actual water demand of their crops. This practice leads to groundwater scarcity and high production costs of the crops. For precise irrigation, the estimation of water needed by a crop is the most significant factor. For proper estimation of irrigation water, the Food and Agriculture Organization recommends the Penman–Monteith method as the most scientific one. However, this method is very complex, involving several region-specific and climatic parameters. It is practically impossible for rural farmers to estimate the daily need for irrigation water using the Penman–Monteith method. As a practical alternative, an automated system is most desirable for rural farmers. This paper presents an irrigation support system to estimate the irrigation water required for a crop correctly. The system has been designed using an assembly of multiple regressors to get the best possible outcome. The outperformed regressor(s) is selected based on the performance evaluated using five standard metrics. This system will benefit rural farmers to estimate the exact quantity of irrigation water needed for a crop. The proposed system is an effective solution to encounter groundwater scarcity and lower the production cost of the crops.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics']",in india the agriculture sector uses about  of the total available water for irrigation most of the irrigation is surfacebased and nearly  of the irrigation water is wasted due to the unscientific practices adopted by the rural farmers to estimate the actual water demand of their crops this practice leads to groundwater scarcity and high production costs of the crops for precise irrigation the estimation of water needed by a crop is the most significant factor for proper estimation of irrigation water the food and agriculture organization recommends the penman–monteith method as the most scientific one however this method is very complex involving several regionspecific and climatic parameters it is practically impossible for rural farmers to estimate the daily need for irrigation water using the penman–monteith method as a practical alternative an automated system is most desirable for rural farmers this paper presents an irrigation support system to estimate the irrigation water required for a crop correctly the system has been designed using an assembly of multiple regressors to get the best possible outcome the outperformed regressors is selected based on the performance evaluated using five standard metrics this system will benefit rural farmers to estimate the exact quantity of irrigation water needed for a crop the proposed system is an effective solution to encounter groundwater scarcity and lower the production cost of the crops,"in this paper , an automated system for accurate estimation of the exact quantity of irrigation water needed for a crop has been designed using multiple regressors . based on the performance evaluation using five standard metrics , the outperformed regressors<n>","['climatic parameters' 'groundwater scarcity' 'india'

doi:10.1007/978-981-19-1061-6_4,en,Using the STP-EX Model for a Screening Level Assessment of Chemicals of Emerging Concern During the Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant Process,OriginalPaper,"Chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) can potentially flow through Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants (MWTPs) into receiving water bodies leading to human exposures and negative ecological impacts. However, throughout the multiple sequential MWTP processes, these CECs may be subjected to various removal mechanisms, including volatilization, sorption, and degradation (mostly biodegradation, but also may include photodegradation). The determination and quantification of these removal mechanisms in situ for MWTPs is difficult/impossible; thus, MWTP environmental fate models have been recognized as useful tools for studying and predicting the fate and transport of CECs through MWTPs. These models use both MWTP plant parameters (e.g., flow rates, solids concentrations, tank volumes, etc.) and CEC physico-chemical parameters (e.g., solubility, molecular weight, etc.) to determine CEC mass balances and fates. The current study uses the STP-EX model for the determination of partitioning maps using ‘typical’ activated sludge-type, facultative lagoon, and aerated lagoon MWTP process parameters. The partitioning maps are presented based on the octanol–water (Log K ow ) and air–water (Log K aw ) partition coefficients, which were varied incrementally from 1 to 9 and 2 to −9, respectively, creating a 9 × 12 grid ‘chemical space’ representing potential chemicals of interest. Using these partitioning based maps, biodegradation was then included in the model using ‘recalcitrant’ chemical biodegradation rates ranging from 100 to 25,000 h and ‘readily biodegradable’ chemical biodegradation rates ranging from 1 to 250 h. Generally, the impact of biodegradation was found to be highest for the activated sludge-type MWTPs (especially at low Log K ow values), while volatilization and sorption to solids dominated the facultative lagoon and aerated lagoon chemical fates with marginal impacts of biodegradation in low Log K ow value ranges. For further understanding of the partitioning maps, case studies were considered for five chemicals of interest (di-2-Ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), fluoranthene, toluene, cyclooctane, and dimethyl phthalate (DMP)) which are presented to discuss their fate and transport both with and without inclusion of either ‘recalcitrant’ or ‘readily biodegradable’ biodegradation rates.","['Engineering', 'Building Materials', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']",chemicals of emerging concern cecs can potentially flow through municipal wastewater treatment plants mwtps into receiving water bodies leading to human exposures and negative ecological impacts however throughout the multiple sequential mwtp processes these cecs may be subjected to various removal mechanisms including volatilization sorption and degradation mostly biodegradation but also may include photodegradation the determination and quantification of these removal mechanisms in situ for mwtps is difficultimpossible; thus mwtp environmental fate models have been recognized as useful tools for studying and predicting the fate and transport of cecs through mwtps these models use both mwtp plant parameters eg flow rates solids concentrations tank volumes etc and cec physicochemical parameters eg solubility molecular weight etc to determine cec mass balances and fates the current study uses the stpex model for the determination of partitioning maps using ‘typical activated sludgetype facultative lagoon and aerated lagoon mwtp process parameters the partitioning maps are presented based on the octanol–water log k ow  and air–water log k aw  partition coefficients which were varied incrementally from  to  and  to − respectively creating a  ×  grid ‘chemical space representing potential chemicals of interest using these partitioning based maps biodegradation was then included in the model using ‘recalcitrant chemical biodegradation rates ranging from  to  h and ‘readily biodegradable chemical biodegradation rates ranging from  to  h generally the impact of biodegradation was found to be highest for the activated sludgetype mwtps especially at low log k ow values while volatilization and sorption to solids dominated the facultative lagoon and aerated lagoon chemical fates with marginal impacts of biodegradation in low log k ow value ranges for further understanding of the partitioning maps case studies were considered for five chemicals of interest diethylhexyl phthalate dehp fluoranthene toluene cyclooctane and dimethyl phthalate dmp which are presented to discuss their fate and transport both with and without inclusion of either ‘recalcitrant or ‘readily biodegradable biodegradation rates,the fates of various diethylhexyl dehp fluorant toluene cyclooctane chemical species ( mwtps ) diethylhexylhexyl dehp fluorant d fluoranthene is studied using the stpex model for,"['##able' '##cl' '##cultative lagoon' '##de' '##tion'

Thus, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms become increasingly appropriate for this domain as the RL algorithms can act on complex problems and adapt their responses in the face of unforeseen situations and environments. The RL agent aims to perform the action that guarantees the optimal reward with the best score. The problem with this approach is if the agent finds a possible optimal action with a reasonable premium and gets stuck in this mediocre strategy, which at the same time is neither the best nor the worst solution. Therefore, the agent avoids performing a more extensive exploration to find new paths and learn alternatives to generate a higher reward. To alleviate this problem, we research the behavior of two types of noise in AVs training. We analyze the results and point out the noise method that most stimulates exploration. A vast exploration of the environment is highly relevant to AVs because they know more about the environment and learn alternative ways of acting in the face of uncertainties. With that, AVs can expect more reliable actions in front of sudden changes in the environment. According to our experiments’ results in a simulator, we can see that noise allows the autonomous vehicle to improve its exploration and increase the reward.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes']",autonomous vehicles avs have multiple tasks with different priorities and safety levels where classic supervised learning techniques are no longer applicable thus reinforcement learning rl algorithms become increasingly appropriate for this domain as the rl algorithms can act on complex problems and adapt their responses in the face of unforeseen situations and environments the rl agent aims to perform the action that guarantees the optimal reward with the best score the problem with this approach is if the agent finds a possible optimal action with a reasonable premium and gets stuck in this mediocre strategy which at the same time is neither the best nor the worst solution therefore the agent avoids performing a more extensive exploration to find new paths and learn alternatives to generate a higher reward to alleviate this problem we research the behavior of two types of noise in avs training we analyze the results and point out the noise method that most stimulates exploration a vast exploration of the environment is highly relevant to avs because they know more about the environment and learn alternative ways of acting in the face of uncertainties with that avs can expect more reliable actions in front of sudden changes in the environment according to our experiments results in a simulator we can see that noise allows the autonomous vehicle to improve its exploration and increase the reward,reinforcement learning ( rl ) algorithms are increasingly appropriate for autonomous vehicles ( avs ) .<n> we investigate the behavior of two types of noise in avs training we analyze the results and point out the noise method that most stimulates exploration,"['##l' 'autonomous vehicle' 'avs training' 'mediocre strategy'

Therefore, we propose a novel and highly secure symmetric-key cryptography, symKrypt for short, to defend against diverse attacks and provide tighter security than the conventional cryptography. Our proposed algorithm uses multiple private keys to encrypt a single block of a message. To generate the private keys, we again propose a true-random number generator, called Grando, and a pseudo-random number generator, called Prando. Moreover, symKrypt keeps secret about the bit mixing of the original message with the private keys. Also, the number of private keys is kept secret. In addition, the private keys are generated dynamically based on the initial inputs using a pseudo-random number generator which is highly unpredictable and secure. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the capabilities of symKrypt and provide experimental demonstration using millions of private keys to prove its correctness. Furthermore, we demonstrate the proposed pseudo-random number generator algorithm experimentally in NIST SP 800-22 statistical test suite. Our propose random number generators, Grando and Rando, pass all 15 tests in the NIST SP 800-22 test suite.

Studies have employed a variety of sensory systems to collect the occupancy data and understand human behaviors throughout buildings. However, establishing a dedicated sensor network to collect occupancy data can become expensive for building owners. In this context, obtaining occupancy data from an existing WiFi network could eliminate the cost concerns. Data within the WiFi routers provide sufficient information for accurate estimates of occupancy. To estimate occupancy levels, this work proposes to learn and recognize WiFi connection using an Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) artificial neural network. A detailed understanding of occupancy patterns using the WiFi data is helpful for developing heating and cooling schedules that optimize HVAC energy consumption. For this study, occupancy data was collected over a 17-week semester at the University of New Mexico using existing WiFi routers located in a large lecture hall used by multiple classes. This data was used to learn patterns of repetition using the neural network. The results show that if the 24-h occupancy profiles can be subdivided into smaller time segments defined by external schedules such as lecture start and end times or other constraints, significant patterns can be detected. A detailed understanding of these patterns can greatly facilitate occupancy load forecasting for effective building management (e.g. HVAC operation).","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Geoengineering, Foundations, Hydraulics', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Environment, general']",research that predicts occupancy patterns in commercial buildings has gained in significance ever since the influence of occupants on building energy consumption became evident studies have employed a variety of sensory systems to collect the occupancy data and understand human behaviors throughout buildings however establishing a dedicated sensor network to collect occupancy data can become expensive for building owners in this context obtaining occupancy data from an existing wifi network could eliminate the cost concerns data within the wifi routers provide sufficient information for accurate estimates of occupancy to estimate occupancy levels this work proposes to learn and recognize wifi connection using an adaptive resonance theory art artificial neural network a detailed understanding of occupancy patterns using the wifi data is helpful for developing heating and cooling schedules that optimize hvac energy consumption for this study occupancy data was collected over a week semester at the university of new mexico using existing wifi routers located in a large lecture hall used by multiple classes this data was used to learn patterns of repetition using the neural network the results show that if the h occupancy profiles can be subdivided into smaller time segments defined by external schedules such as lecture start and end times or other constraints significant patterns can be detected a detailed understanding of these patterns can greatly facilitate occupancy load forecasting for effective building management eg hvac operation,this work proposes to use an adaptive resonance theory art artificial neural network to learn and recognize wifi connection using an existing wifi network occupancy data collected over a week semester at the university of new mexico using existing wifi routers this data was used to learn patterns of,"['##cc' '##fi' '##g' '##ing' 'adaptive resonance theory'

The posts or comments collected from the social networking sites are needed to be analysed for identifying the positive or negative public sentiments regarding the products or services of any organization in order to improve their services. Over the last few years, research on sentiment analysis using Machine Learning (ML) tools is very popular. However, the sentiment analysis of Bengali data corpus using a Machine Learning tool is limited. It has been observed that the ML models for sentiment analysis are suffering from misclassification and researchers are still trying to come up with better solutions. In this paper, a Machine Learning approach is proposed for sentiment analysis of the Bengali data set collected from Facebook. Since the posts or comments that exhibit negative polarity are more actionable than the positive ones, the prime aim of this paper is to identify the negative sentiments without being misclassified and introduces a new technique to achieve almost 100% specificity by tuning the class weight of the ML classification model. We have also tried to improve the accuracy of ML classifiers during the sentiment analysis by combining the Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging with Term Frequency—Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization.

Excessive vibration is one of the main causes of blade failure, which may affect the safe and stable operation of the equipment. Therefore, it is significant to detect and analyze blade vibration characteristics. Blade tip-timing (BTT) technology has the advantages of non-contact and simple installation, which is widely used in online blade vibration monitoring of turbomachinery. In this paper, the research of using BTT technology to measure the vibration characteristic parameters of the last stage moving blade of a steam turbine with integral shroud and snubber is carried out. Firstly, a finite element model of the last stage blade is built, the stress distribution and mode shape of the blade are obtained through simulation analysis. Secondly, the blade vibration measuring experiment is accomplished on a dynamic balancing test-bed, and the synchronous vibration parameters such as resonance speed are calculated correctly under lowing speed working condition based on BTT technology. Furthermore, the strain gauge method is used simultaneously to verify the accuracy of the measurement results. The resonance frequency and engine order of the blade are measured successfully. The analysis results show that parameters such as resonance speed identified by BTT method are consistent with that measured by strain gauge method. The research results prove the effectiveness of BTT technology in measuring the vibration parameters of the last stage blade with integral shroud and snubber, which can provide reference for design rationality verification and vibration characteristics detection of the steam turbine blade.","['Engineering', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Machinery and Machine Elements']",as the key component of the steam turbine the steam turbine blade needs to work in a complex and rigorous operating environment which easily leads to blade cracks or even fractures and other faults excessive vibration is one of the main causes of blade failure which may affect the safe and stable operation of the equipment therefore it is significant to detect and analyze blade vibration characteristics blade tiptiming btt technology has the advantages of noncontact and simple installation which is widely used in online blade vibration monitoring of turbomachinery in this paper the research of using btt technology to measure the vibration characteristic parameters of the last stage moving blade of a steam turbine with integral shroud and snubber is carried out firstly a finite element model of the last stage blade is built the stress distribution and mode shape of the blade are obtained through simulation analysis secondly the blade vibration measuring experiment is accomplished on a dynamic balancing testbed and the synchronous vibration parameters such as resonance speed are calculated correctly under lowing speed working condition based on btt technology furthermore the strain gauge method is used simultaneously to verify the accuracy of the measurement results the resonance frequency and engine order of the blade are measured successfully the analysis results show that parameters such as resonance speed identified by btt method are consistent with that measured by strain gauge method the research results prove the effectiveness of btt technology in measuring the vibration parameters of the last stage blade with integral shroud and snubber which can provide reference for design rationality verification and vibration characteristics detection of the steam turbine blade,"in this paper , the vibration characteristic parameters of the last stage moving blade of a steam turbine with integral shroud and snubber are detected and measured using blade tiptiming btt technology .","['##ing speed' 'analysis' 'blade failure' 'blade tip'

doi:10.1007/978-3-031-06780-8_20,en,"Machine Learning for Automotive Cybersecurity: Challenges, Opportunities and Future Directions",OriginalPaper,"Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) hold the promise of not only improving functional safety but also improving mobility and the efficiency of transportation systems. CAVs can be viewed as a cyber-physical system that contains a large number of minicomputers called electronic control units (ECUs). In order for ECU subsystems to share information and operate efficiently, they are typically networked via various in-vehicle networks (IVNs). Such IVNs include the controller area network (CAN), local interconnected network (LIN), media-oriented system transport (MOST), FlexRay and automotive Ethernet. These IVNs are used to connect safety-critical and non-critical components of the vehicle, including brakes, airbags, engine control, active safety devices, the electronic stability program and adaptive cruise control. Although these IVNs provide some luxury functions and improve the functional safety of the vehicles, the use of in-vehicle communication networks can pose serious security threats to CAVs. Several incidents have been reported showing that intruders are able to access vehicle information, even for safety critical tasks. As the IVNs architecturally are not designed to defend against these attacks, additional methods are needed for security. In recent years researchers are taking advantage of advances in more powerful computing hardware, as well the availability of huge amounts of network data and proposing machine learning-based frameworks to secure these IVNs. To the best of our knowledge, these frameworks lack details such as how to apply machine learning for IVN security. Most of them are focused on the selection of machine learning algorithms to improve attack detection rates. As a result, these frameworks become uninterpreted since they took a lot of time in order to reproduce their result. An efficient successful machine learning system depends not only on the selected machine learning algorithm but also on the quality of data. This chapter aims to bridge this research gap by developing a generalized machine learning pipeline designed to defend against existing and emerging cyberattacks on IVNs. The chapter starts with an overview of IVNs, threat modeling of IVNs followed by machine learning-based defense mechanisms against existing and emerging cyberattacks targeted at these IVNs. The last section of the chapter outlines future directions of using the proposed machine learning approach as a solution against vehicle-based cyberattacks for the next generation of vehicles.","['Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing']",connected autonomous vehicles cavs hold the promise of not only improving functional safety but also improving mobility and the efficiency of transportation systems cavs can be viewed as a cyberphysical system that contains a large number of minicomputers called electronic control units ecus in order for ecu subsystems to share information and operate efficiently they are typically networked via various invehicle networks ivns such ivns include the controller area network can local interconnected network lin mediaoriented system transport most flexray and automotive ethernet these ivns are used to connect safetycritical and noncritical components of the vehicle including brakes airbags engine control active safety devices the electronic stability program and adaptive cruise control although these ivns provide some luxury functions and improve the functional safety of the vehicles the use of invehicle communication networks can pose serious security threats to cavs several incidents have been reported showing that intruders are able to access vehicle information even for safety critical tasks as the ivns architecturally are not designed to defend against these attacks additional methods are needed for security in recent years researchers are taking advantage of advances in more powerful computing hardware as well the availability of huge amounts of network data and proposing machine learningbased frameworks to secure these ivns to the best of our knowledge these frameworks lack details such as how to apply machine learning for ivn security most of them are focused on the selection of machine learning algorithms to improve attack detection rates as a result these frameworks become uninterpreted since they took a lot of time in order to reproduce their result an efficient successful machine learning system depends not only on the selected machine learning algorithm but also on the quality of data this chapter aims to bridge this research gap by developing a generalized machine learning pipeline designed to defend against existing and emerging cyberattacks on ivns the chapter starts with an overview of ivns threat modeling of ivns followed by machine learningbased defense mechanisms against existing and emerging cyberattacks targeted at these ivns the last section of the chapter outlines future directions of using the proposed machine learning approach as a solution against vehiclebased cyberattacks for the next generation of vehicles,connected autonomous vehicles ( cavs ) hold the promise of not only improving functional safety but also improving mobility and the efficiency of transportation systems researchers are taking advantage of advances in more powerful computing hardware as well as the availability of huge amounts of network data,"['##bags' '##physical' '##put' 'adaptive cruise control' 'bridge' 'cavs'

First, we extend an existing taxonomy of the most widely used clustering algorithms in machine learning with additional classes. Second, we compare the performance of algorithms from each class of the taxonomy, extracting behavioral patterns. Partitional and hierarchical algorithms obtain the best results, while density-based algorithms have poor results. The results show four differentiated patterns in vehicular behavior, distinguishing different patterns in both residents and tourists.

Customer churn prediction is the process of determining the proportion of clients who avoid or might stop using or subscribing to a product or service offered by an organization or company. Though various prediction models have been proposed, most research attention has been given to measuring the efficiency of prediction models, rather than identifying its application for sustainable economic development. In this paper, we investigate the determining factor for customer attrition in the banking sector using Power BI. Dataset from United Bank of Africa (UBA), Nigeria was preprocessed with four key customer variables were used. The decision tree algorithm available in the Power Bi software was employed for training and testing. The results show that customer account balance is a key determining variable for churning. Furthermore, the results show that churning occurs less in male than female clients. This work will provide banks with useful knowledge on building effective customer retention strategies. Building an effective and accurate customer churn prediction model is an important research problem for both academics and practitioners.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Mobile and Network Security', 'Artificial Intelligence']",the development of technology in our modern day has led to the generation of huge data this is evident by the  quintillions of data generated by persons connected to the internet per day in  with the expectation of  billion internet users by  complex and efficient tools models or approaches that will explore analyze and produce meaningful hidden information from huge data are needed in recent years machine learning techniques such as logistic regression decision trees and clustering are beginning to gain relevance especially in churn prediction customer churn prediction is the process of determining the proportion of clients who avoid or might stop using or subscribing to a product or service offered by an organization or company though various prediction models have been proposed most research attention has been given to measuring the efficiency of prediction models rather than identifying its application for sustainable economic development in this paper we investigate the determining factor for customer attrition in the banking sector using power bi dataset from united bank of africa uba nigeria was preprocessed with four key customer variables were used the decision tree algorithm available in the power bi software was employed for training and testing the results show that customer account balance is a key determining variable for churning furthermore the results show that churning occurs less in male than female clients this work will provide banks with useful knowledge on building effective customer retention strategies building an effective and accurate customer churn prediction model is an important research problem for both academics and practitioners,this paper investigates the determining factor for customer attrition in the banking sector using power bi dataset from united bank of africa uba preprocessed with four key customer variables were used the decision tree algorithm available in the power bi software was employed for training and testing,"['banking sector' 'banks' 'churn prediction model' 'clustering' 'customer'

The TCS is a common-property resource that was constructed about 2000 years ago and has been managed since then for generations using public-participatory approaches. Furthermore, the application of TCS is not only limited to irrigation but also domestic water supply, livestock management, retarding negative impacts from extreme events such as seasonal flooding and recurrent droughts. In addition, the indirect benefits of TCS in providing environmental services, being essentially controlling the micro-climatic conditions, are numerous. However, TCS has been degrading since the colonial rule due to limited TCS management. The policy on the rights to manage minor irrigation works (tank irrigation) lies in the hands of the estate continued even during the post-independence period. As a consequence, the rural economy and livelihood security, which was essentially dependent on TCS , collapsed. Nevertheless, since the 1980s, the Indian Government started realizing the significance of traditional TCS in the view of climate change, rapid urbanization, and demographic explosion. Several schemes and programs were launched in bilateral associations with local and foreign agencies including the World Bank. The evidence indicated that the policy interventions in regards to scientific revival and ecological restoration, and rehabilitation of tanks for providing substantial benefits to the stakeholders (farmers and local communities) are rational. Interventions for tank management are much-needed with a case-to-case approach rather than implementing the ideology of one model fits all.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Science and Technology Studies', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes']",the vast semiarid southern peninsular region of india is irrigated using a traditional surface water infrastructure called tank cascade systems  tcs  the tcs is a commonproperty resource that was constructed about  years ago and has been managed since then for generations using publicparticipatory approaches furthermore the application of tcs is not only limited to irrigation but also domestic water supply livestock management retarding negative impacts from extreme events such as seasonal flooding and recurrent droughts in addition the indirect benefits of tcs in providing environmental services being essentially controlling the microclimatic conditions are numerous however tcs has been degrading since the colonial rule due to limited tcs management the policy on the rights to manage minor irrigation works tank irrigation lies in the hands of the estate continued even during the postindependence period as a consequence the rural economy and livelihood security which was essentially dependent on tcs  collapsed nevertheless since the s the indian government started realizing the significance of traditional tcs in the view of climate change rapid urbanization and demographic explosion several schemes and programs were launched in bilateral associations with local and foreign agencies including the world bank the evidence indicated that the policy interventions in regards to scientific revival and ecological restoration and rehabilitation of tanks for providing substantial benefits to the stakeholders farmers and local communities are rational interventions for tank management are muchneeded with a casetocase approach rather than implementing the ideology of one model fits all,tank cascade systems ( tcs ) is an important water resource for the semiarid southern peninsular region of india the application of tcs is not only limited to irrigation but also domestic water supply livestock management retarding negative impacts from extreme,"['##tocase approach' 'climate change rapid urbanization' 'colonial rule'

Specifically, the sample-inefficiency and limited adaptation across tasks often make classic RL techniques impractical for real-world applications despite the gained representational power when combining deep neural networks with RL, known as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Recently, a number of approaches to address those issues have emerged. Many of those solutions are based on smart DRL architectures that enhance single task algorithms with the capability to share knowledge between agents and across tasks by introducing Transfer Learning (TL) capabilities. This survey addresses strategies of knowledge transfer from simple parameter sharing to privacy preserving federated learning and aims at providing a general overview of the field of TL in the DRL domain, establishes a classification framework, and briefly describes representative works in the area.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning']",although reinforcement learning rl algorithms have made impressive progress in learning complex tasks over the past years there are still prevailing shortcomings and challenges specifically the sampleinefficiency and limited adaptation across tasks often make classic rl techniques impractical for realworld applications despite the gained representational power when combining deep neural networks with rl known as deep reinforcement learning drl recently a number of approaches to address those issues have emerged many of those solutions are based on smart drl architectures that enhance single task algorithms with the capability to share knowledge between agents and across tasks by introducing transfer learning tl capabilities this survey addresses strategies of knowledge transfer from simple parameter sharing to privacy preserving federated learning and aims at providing a general overview of the field of tl in the drl domain establishes a classification framework and briefly describes representative works in the area,this survey provides an overview of the field of transfer learning in deep reinforcement learning ( rl ) and related deep reinforcement learning ( drl ) methods .<n> we introduce the basic concepts of parameter sharing and privacy preserving federated learning in the,"['classic rl techniques' 'deep neural networks'
